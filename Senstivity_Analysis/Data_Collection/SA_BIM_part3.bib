Abstract = {In the field of AEC/FM, BIM has been recognized by industrial and
   political actors as a powerful tool for resolving data interoperability
   problems. Coupled with cloud computing and GIS, BIM would allow
   integrating different information exchange standard into one single
   digital building model that can be real-time edited by several
   stakeholders or architects. In this paper, we examine the benefits
   brought by using Semantic Web technologies in delivering such universal
   building model. We present how our approach is a step further in
   reaching the vision of BIM, and how it can serve construction process,
   operation and maintenance, along with facilities' lifecycle management.},

Abstract = {Information flow management plays a significant role in ensuring the
   reliable exchange of Building Information Modeling (BIM) data between
   project team members in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and
   Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry. The buildingSMART standard
   approach to resolving this issue is based upon the Information Delivery
   Manual (IDM), which provides a collaborative methodology for specifying
   AEC/FM process flows and their information contents. The IDMs in current
   use indicate that focus has mainly been on formalizing more general
   parts of the building design process, where multiple project team
   members perform a wide range of design tasks. Because IDMs typically
   describe such complex processes, they are difficult to manage and
   complicated to implement in real-world AEC/FM projects. In this study,
   we address these challenges by proposing a Work Breakdown Structure
   (WBS) methodology, breaking down the IDMs into smaller IDM Packages. We
   introduce a modular IDM Framework aimed at defining and organizing
   generic IDM Packages for all main use cases of the AEC/FM project life
   cycle. In this methodology, an IDM Project Plan can be created by
   selecting the specific IDM Packages required for a specific AEC/FM
   project. Ultimately, we believe that the IDM Framework will help improve
   information flow management and the reusability of IDM Packages amongst
   unique AEC/FM projects. In addition, we believe that the IDM Framework
   will support the potential harmonization of the development of new IDMs,
   as the specific context of each IDM Package, and the relationship to
   other IDM Packages, becomes clearer. Such harmonization is also
   necessary, if improved interoperability between AEC/FM software tools is
   the goal.},

Title = {Blockchain-Based Responsibility Management Framework for Smart City
   Building Information Modeling Projects Using Non-Fungible Tokens},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the context of digital construction, responsibility management in
   smart city building information modeling (BIM) projects spans the entire
   building lifecycle. The involvement of numerous BIM designers in project
   management and frequent data exchanges pose significant challenges for
   the traceability, immutability, and responsibility attribution of BIM
   models. To address these issues, this study proposes a blockchain-based
   responsibility management and collaboration framework for BIM projects
   using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), aiming to enhance the management of
   responsibilities and accountability in BIM projects. This research
   adopts a design science methodology, strictly adhering to scientific
   research procedures to ensure rigor. First, NFTs based on blockchain
   technology were developed to generate corresponding digital signatures
   for BIM model files. This approach ensures that each BIM model file has
   a unique digital identity, enhancing transparency and traceability in
   responsibility management. Next, the interplanetary file system (IPFS)
   was used to generate digital fingerprints, with the content identifier
   generated by IPFS uploaded to the blockchain to ensure the immutability
   of BIM model files. This method guarantees the integrity and security of
   BIM model files throughout their lifecycle. Finally, the proposed
   methods were validated through a blockchain network. The experimental
   results indicate that the proposed framework is theoretically highly
   feasible and demonstrates good applicability and efficiency in practical
   production. The constructed blockchain network meets the actual needs of
   responsibility management in smart city BIM projects, enhancing the
   transparency and reliability of project management.},

Title = {In situ virtual sensing for dwelling infiltration rates in multi-unit
   residential buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Wind- and stack-interacted dwelling infiltration is a major factor
   influencing heating and cooling loads, indoor environmental quality, and
   indoor air quality (IAQ) in high-rise or multi-unit residential
   buildings (MURB). However, it is challenging to observe the real-time
   infiltration rates in an entire building using existing sensors.
   Therefore, this study proposes a virtual sensing method for dwelling
   infiltration rates in MURB. Virtual sensing is developed in situ for the
   target MURB by a hybrid modeling approach combining forward simulation
   and inverse estimation using the building life cycle. It mainly consists
   of (1) multi-zone airflow network modeling with design information, (2)
   model calibration with intrusive commissioning data, and (3) virtual
   sensing with nonintrusive operation data. The proposed method can
   observe the outdoor air infiltration rates across the envelope and the
   interzonal airflow rates at the entrance door by dwelling units. In the
   validation case, the hybrid modeling approach could determine the
   reliable infiltration rate (with 97.16\% accuracy). In the application,
   all dwelling units were rated by the thresholds in terms of the heating
   loads and IAQ based on the virtual sensing results. We strongly
   recommend observing dwelling infiltration in each household using the
   proposed virtual sensing method.},

Abstract = {Construction materials play an important role in environmental impacts
   and make cities big resource consumers. To assess the sustainability of
   cities, the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Material
   Flow Analysis (MFA) is considered effective to analyze construction
   material stock and flows. However, exhaustive data is required for such
   analyses, making LCA and MFA difficult to apply at the urban scale.
   Building information, the essential ingredient, is rarely available
   openly. Common approaches to gather the required data include both
   obtaining it directly from available datasets, e.g. open data from
   official sources, and indirectly generating data based on available
   data, e.g. using machine learning to fill the missing gaps. This
   research develops a data collection guideline for buildings' geometrical
   features, components and materials at the urban scale in the context of
   LCA and MFA. First, it identifies the basic steps of urban-scale
   building stock modelling and the list of data requirements. Second, the
   factors influencing the data collection are pointed out. In line with
   these guidelines, this research picks Singapore as a study area,
   reviewing the relevant authoritative open data sources and methodologies
   to estimate missing data. Finally, the suggestion on implementation of
   data collection are provided. When the data collection for urban scale
   stock modelling is limited by uncertain reality conditions, identifying
   and combining open datasets and data generation methods for data
   preparation is a necessity.},

Abstract = {Circular Economy (CE) has proved its contribution to addressing
   environmental impacts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction

   developed to measure the circularity of building projects. However,
   there still exists ambiguity and inconsistency in these methods. Based
   on the reviewed literature, this study proposes a new framework for BC
   assessment, including a material flow model, a Material Passport (MP),
   and a BC calculation method. The material flow model redefines the
   concept of BC assessment, containing three circularity cycles and five
   indicators. The BC MP defines the data needed for the assessment, and
   the BC calculation method provides the equations for building
   circularity scoring. The proposed framework offers a comprehensive basis

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction sector plays a significant role in resource consumption
   and waste generation, making the transition to a circular economy (CE)
   imperative for sustainability in this sector. This paper focuses on
   developing a framework for implementing CE principles in the
   construction sector, guided by expert opinions and insights. The main
   objective of this study was to enhance existing theoretical frameworks
   by incorporating feedback from construction experts to improve practical
   utility and applicability in real-world construction practices. By
   addressing key areas for enhancement, the revised framework facilitates
   the adoption of CE practices throughout the asset lifecycle, considering
   buildings from cradle to cradle. This research's methodology involved a
   comprehensive literature review to identify gaps in current frameworks
   related to CE implementation in the construction sector. Unstructured
   interviews with twenty construction experts were conducted to gather
   insights and recommendations for framework improvement. Data analysis
   highlighted the importance of integrating CE principles at various
   stages of the asset lifecycle, such as design, construction, and
   end-of-life phases. The key recommendations from experts include
   incorporating sustainable approaches, aligning with BIM models, and
   considering whole-life design aspects to promote circularity in the
   construction sector. By incorporating expert feedback and industry
   insights, the framework aims to guide practitioners toward more
   sustainable and resource-efficient construction practices, contributing
   to the broader field of CE implementation in the built environment.},

Title = {Monetary valuation of the environmental benefits of green building: A
   case study of China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {365},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Reducing negative impacts on the environment is the main benefit of
   green buildings. However, these benefits are typically evaluated using
   environmental indicators with different units and implications. Thus,
   comparisons among different technologies and projects with various
   benefits are difficult to perform. Moreover, the impact of green
   building development on economic system is difficult to analyze because
   of the lack of available data. This study proposes a method of
   identifying, quantifying and valuing the environmental benefits of green
   buildings based on the contributions of typical technologies. The
   environmental benefits are fully identified based on the cause-effect
   chain associated with changes in environmental endpoints caused by green
   technologies. Then, a valuation method is proposed, and it consists of
   the following four steps: quantifying the technical indicators using the
   application criteria and green technology impacts, quantifying the
   environmental indicators using available and reliable research data,
   valuing the environmental benefits using appropriate monetary valuation
   methods, and calculating the lifecycle benefits using the discounted
   cash flow method. All projects accredited by the Chinese Assessment
   Standard of Green Building from 2008 to 2015 were evaluated using the
   environmental valuation method. The results showed that 75\% of typical
   green technologies could reduce the negative impacts on the environment
   through different endpoints. The benefit per unit area was valued as yen
   3138.1 on average. The majority of the benefits (48.36\%) were produced
   by underground space utilization. The public green building produced
   more environmental value than the residential green building. Overall,
   the environmental benefits were sufficient to cover the incremental
   costs of green building. The results obtained by the proposed assessment
   method provide more comprehensive information to related sectors than
   the green level standards; moreover, the benefits obtained by different
   technologies and projects with various environmental impacts can be
   compared, and important input data can be obtained for analyzing the
   macroeconomic effects of green building development.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the issues of formation of internal and
   external public-communication spaces in civil buildings, in particular,
   during the development of spatial planning decisions of general
   education establishments. The possibilities and conditions for the
   formation of the project potential using innovative engineering
   technologies that undoubtedly determine the life cycle of the building
   and its further typological development are considered. The main factors
   that determine the relevance of the problem of communication and
   coordination of information and cultural relations, especially in
   educational buildings, are given. These factors allow to evaluate the
   need for investigation of stated problems. The idea of a school building
   as a standard organizational structure with a set of core functional
   blocks tightly interconnected can be reconsidered and substantially
   supplemented. To a large extent this concerns issues of personal and
   public communications, which are doubtless important for all potential
   participants of the educational process and for the development of
   educational programs. The article presents typological analogs from the
   world design, architectural and construction practice, as well as the
   results of the research and project approbation of the model of the
   ecopositive school building on the criterias of sustainable development,
   as part of the residential area of the perspective construction of the
   village `` Polevodstvo{''} in the Yekaterinburg (Russia).},

Title = {Estimating Materials Stocked by Land-Use Type in Historic Urban

Abstract = {The construction industry is an important contributor to urban economic
   development and consumes large volumes of building material that are
   stocked in cities over long periods. Those stocked spaces store valuable
   materials that may be available for recovery in the future. Thus
   quantifying the urban building stock is important for managing
   construction materials across the building life cycle. This article
   develops a new approach to urban building material stock analysis (MSA)
   using land-use heuristics. Our objective is to characterize buildings to
   understand materials stocked in place by: (1) developing, validating,
   and testing a new method for characterizing building stock by land-use
   type and (2) quantifying building stock and determining material
   fractions. We conduct a spatial MSA to quantify materials within a
   2.6-square-kilometer section of Philadelphia from 2004 to 2012. Data
   were collected for buildings classified by land-use type from many
   sources to create maps of material stock and spatial material intensity.
   In the spatial MSA, the land-use type that returned the largest
   footprint (by percentage) and greatest (number) of buildings were
   civic/institutional (42\%; 147) and residential (23\%; 275),
   respectively. The model was validated for total floor space and the
   absolute overall error (n = 46; 20\%) in 2004 and (n = 47; 24\%) in
   2012. Typically, commercial and residential land-use types returned the
   lowest overall error and weighted error. We present a promising
   alternative method for characterizing buildings in urban MSA that
   leverages multiple tools (geographical information systems {[}GIS],
   design codes, and building models) and test the method in historic
   Philadelphia.},

Abstract = {The building and construction industry are an important part of the EU
   economy and society. It contributes to about 9\% of the EU's GDP (Gross
   Domestic Product) and provides around 18 million direct jobs, it also
   creates high-skills jobs and investment in other industries that leads
   to further social and economic benefits {[}1].
   There are two important challenges to address in the sector. One is
   related to the increasing implementation of ICT (Information \&
   Communication Technologies) tools, while the other is associated with a
   greater requirement of managerial and collective skills brought by the
   changing profile of the sector {[}2].
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) is disrupting the sector. This tool
   provides all stakeholders with a digital representation of a building's
   characteristics throughout its entire life-cycle and thereby holds out
   the promise of large efficiency gains. BIM is being rapidly adopted, so
   it is critical for public bodies and industries that sector maximises
   its value to deliver improved efficiencies and increased innovation in
   the management, design, construct and operation phases of a built asset
   {[}3]. Training the current and incoming workforce is necessary to
   ensure effective adoption of BIM.
   The demand of public and private environments adapted to the needs of
   older adults is expected to grow in the coming years. By 2050, the
   number of people in the EU aged 65 and above is expected to grow by 70\%
   and the number of people 80 by 170\% {[}4]. Despite living longer, EU
   citizens will spend too many years in old age environments conceived for
   younger and healthier people, creating dependency, isolation and mental
   health problems {[}5]. Being physical and social environments key
   determinants for people to remain healthy and autonomous into their old
   age {[}6], {[}7].
   In this context, the use of BIM in the design, construction and
   management of multifunctional indoor environments will greatly
   contribute to meet the requirements of Europe's ageing population while
   promoting healthy and safe ageing. The main aim of ESSENSE is to develop
   and implement a common curriculum and learning approach on BIM towards
   the design, construction and management of public and private
   environments for older adults that will meet the learning needs of
   Higher Education students. These will be relevant to the labour market
   and societal needs of an ageing society.
   ESSENSE will offer innovative educational tools to Higher Education
   students and experts from building-related fields that are aligned with
   the future needs of society and with the opportunities that the
   implementation of Smart Housing and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL)
   principles and concepts that BIM processes can bring.},

Abstract = {It is proved that construction sector plays an essential role in the
   economic development of a country. One of the greatest challenges in the
   modern construction economics is efficient decision-making in particular
   situations. Contemporary decision-making problems can be solved by
   applying multiple criteria decision support methods, modelling
   procedures as well as various IT supported systems. Currently, a built
   environment is characterized by the intensive creation and use of
   information, knowledge and automation applications (software, knowledge,
   expert and decision support systems, and neural networks). It is
   commonly agreed that use of these applications will significantly speed
   up processes in construction sector, improve the quality of the built
   environment, value of decisions made and decrease the overall cost of a
   built environment's life cycle. The article presents a review of
   scientific work of Professor Arturas Kaklauskas on decision support
   methods, modelling, intelligent and biometric systems in the field of

Abstract = {Radiology is a major contributor to health care's impact on climate
   change, in part due to its reliance on energy -intensive equipment as
   well as its growing technological reliance. Delivering modern patient
   care requires a robust informatics team to move images from the imaging
   equipment to the workstations and the health care system. Radiology
   informatics is the field that manages medical imaging IT. This involves
   the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of imaging information in
   health care to improve access and quality, which includes PACS, cloud
   services, and artificial intelligence. However, the electricity
   consumption of computing and the life cycle of various computer
   components expands the carbon footprint of health care. The authors
   provide a general framework to understand the environmental impact of
   clinical radiology informatics, which includes using the international
   Greenhouse Gas Protocol to draft a definition of scopes of emissions
   pertinent to radiology informatics, as well as exploring existing tools
   to measure and account for these emissions. A novel standard ecolabel
   for radiology informatics tools, such as the Energy Star label for
   consumer devices or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
   certification for buildings, should be developed to promote awareness
   and guide radiologists and radiology informatics leaders in making
   environmentally conscious decisions for their clinical practice. At this
   critical climate juncture, the radiology community has a unique and
   pressing obligation to consider our shared environmental responsibility
   in innovating clinical technology for patient care.},

Abstract = {It will be a new approach that BIM's capital project lifecycle
   management (CPLM) applied to the yacht industry. This paper explored the
   feasibility of applying the principles and rationales of BIM for capital
   project lifecycle management in luxury yacht design, engineering,
   fabrication, construction and operation. The paper examined the premises
   and backbone technology of BIM. It then evaluated leading naval
   engineering and shipbuilding software applications and their development
   trends from the functional lens of BIM. To systematically investigate a
   BIM-based approach for capital project lifecycle management (CPLM) in
   the luxury yacht industry, the paper proposed and outlined an
   implementation framework. A case study and a student competition use
   case were discussed to delineate the core constituents and processes of
   the proposed framework. The case of BIM was reviewed. Through the
   domestic custom luxury yacht design and prototyping student competition,
   the application of this framework in educational research is
   demonstrated and the initial quantitative assessment of the framework is
   carried out. Conclusions: a BIM-based CPLM implementation framework can
   help the luxury yacht industry capitalize on the global transformation
   to an information-centric and data-driven new business paradigm in
   shipbuilding with integrated design, manufacturing and production.},

Abstract = {The representation of physical buildings in Building Information Models
   (BIM) has been a subject of research since four decades in the fields of
   Construction Informatics and GeoInformatics. The early digital
   representations of buildings mainly appeared as 3D drawings constructed
   by CAD software, and the 3D representation of the buildings was only
   geometric, while semantics and topology were out of modelling focus. On
   the other hand, less detailed building representations, with often focus
   on `outside' representations were also found in form of 2D / 2,5D
   GeoInformation models. Point clouds from 3D laser scanning data give a
   full and exact representation of the building geometry. The article
   presents different aspects and the benefits of using point clouds in BIM
   in the different stages of a lifecycle of a building.},

Title = {Digital technologies and data-driven delay management process for
   construction projects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {One of the main challenges of construction projects is managing delays;
   there is still a lot to overcome to reach near-zero delays (mitigation
   of delays) in all construction projects. Technology and different
   platforms are applied to support a high volume of data flow acquired
   from multiple resources during the construction project life cycle; how
   can these automated and digital progress tracking systems be considered
   for more effective construction delay management? The aim is to
   investigate the current state of real-time technologies and their
   applications and assess how specific attributes of these disruptive
   technologies can significantly alter delay management in construction
   industries. Therefore, this study presents a new process-based framework
   for using technologies with a data lifecycle viewpoint. This research
   uses a four-step systematic literature review involving identification,
   screening, extortion-eligibility check, and selection-inclusion.
   Furthermore, it is followed up by a thematic content analysis on using
   new technologies to mitigate delays in construction projects. Key
   trends, themes, areas of concern for research, and limitations
   identified in previous literature as research gaps and future needs were
   documented and structured. This work presents a novel process of
   comprehensive classification of real-time technologies that are being
   used in the construction industry to acquire data, screen/analyses data,
   and present information through an Industry 4.0 application: IoT
   technologies such as sensors, RFID etc., smartphones,
   planning/scheduling tools (Ms Project, Primavera), and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM). The developed process-based framework is
   served as a roadmap to 1) centralise real-time communication between
   technologies to collect, analysis and presentation data in construction
   phase, 2) prepare timely reports for project managers to take proper
   action against those problems delaying project.},

Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Among all phases of the construction project life cycle, from planning
   to operation and maintenance, the project owner needs to spend maximum
   in terms of project time and cost due to various project variables. If a
   new technology like blockchain is adopted for such function, the
   efficiency of that function can be enhanced. This paper aims to identify
   the key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with the applying
   blockchain technology in construction projects and evaluate the same
   through a multi-criteria-decision-making-tool like the analytical
   network process (ANP). Bibliometric analysis has also been carried out
   to identify the variables that affect the usage of blockchain technology
   as a smart contract, supply chain management, and financing instrument
   tool. Eight significant factors were identified, and responses were
   obtained based on the three-stage questionnaire surveys conducted among
   experts in leading construction companies in India. The results of ANP
   analysis reveal that ``Technology{''} related factors appear to have the
   most significant impact on the construction project. This study will
   contribute to the body of knowledge by supporting the construction
   professionals in project decision-making, assuring timely availability
   of resources, and eventually lowering construction project time and
   expense shortfalls.},

Abstract = {With the improved uptake of Building Information Modelling (BIM) new
   issues are emerging. Prime in these tasks is how it is presented to the
   various stakeholders, in tailor made views to reflect their demands and
   requirements. In this fragmented sector strong in the concept of phased
   handovers new methods of feedback loops need to be developed, and other
   stakeholders outside the procurement process need to be included to
   progress and manage the practice.
   Within this scenario is the role of the facility manager, who currently
   operates separately to the procurement stakeholders. Bridges need to be
   built to bring them closer together especially in light of life cycle
   costing and sustainability if the buildings operations and maintenance
   issues are to be addressed in the design phase. The model's ability to
   host work phases or stages opens up a method to co-inhabit the model to
   accommodate both sets of stakeholders.
   This filtering of the model has both tremendously positive aspects but
   conversely larger issues of ownership and custodianship have not to date
   been satisfactorily resolved. There is a major role for proper
   management here, which has not been appropriately identified. Initially
   there was a clarion call to architects to adopt this role and a few
   years ago this seemed to return the lead role to this noble profession.
   But patently they are neither prepared nor keen to take on this role.
   Constructing architects however do seem to want this discipline which
   can raise their profile and possibly lead to professional recognition
   and prestige.},

Abstract = {Selecting an appropriate software tool for a particular
   energy-management system is a challenging task as there is little

   has its own strengths and limitations, and making a right choice is

   than one hundred simulation software packages that are useful for
   residential-energy-management system analysis. The tools are analyzed
   based on the conventional and CEN-CENELEC-ETSI Smart Grid Reference
   Architecture. Additionally, tools' availability, sources, typical
   applications, strengths, and limitations are discussed. A case study on
   residential energy management and optimization is carried out to show
   the strengths and limitations of a certain computational tool. It is
   observed that none of the tools cover all the applications of
   residential energy systems, however necessary information is provided to
   help researchers to choose the right tools to meet specific objectives.},

Title = {Infrastructure digital twin technology: A new paradigm for future
   construction industry},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The construction industry has traditionally been slow to adopt digital
   technology, resulting in inefficient workflows, frequent cost overruns,
   and delays. Moreover, its fragmented structure, inherent to market
   dynamics, exacerbates these challenges. Embracing digitalization and
   transitioning to Industry 4.0 can substantially enhance efficiency and
   productivity in construction through increased innovation and improved
   collaboration, ultimately reducing information gaps and data
   discrepancies. This study aims to assess the potential integration of
   digital twin technology across various construction stages, spanning
   from initial design to project delivery. Existing literature emphasizes
   the transformative power of digital twin technology in advancing
   building innovation and environmental sustainability. These virtual
   replicas are crucial in optimizing industrial manufacturing by
   harmonizing production processes and societal interactions. A focused
   examination of digital twin technology applications in construction
   highlights its ability to streamline coordination and facilitate data
   sharing among stakeholders. Property owners increasingly recognise the
   value of digital twin technology in local contexts, driving the
   digitization of design and collaboration methods in construction.
   Integrating digital twin technology right from a project's inception and
   extending it across design phases optimizes project delivery, enhances
   asset quality, and contributes to societal sustainability. As the nexus
   between digitalization and sustainability goals strengthens, the
   construction industry stands at the cusp of a significant transformative
   journey.},

Abstract = {Concurrent engineering is a means to shorten product development times.
   Information systems supporting concurrent engineering must facilitate
   the exchange and unambiguous interpretation of product data from various
   design and manufacturing stages, the collaboration of geographically
   dispersed experts in a complex design process, and the use of diverse
   computing platforms and tools.
   We describe our experiences in a joint project with the Department of
   Mechanical Engineering, building an integrated information system for
   concurrent engineering applications. The system is based on a single,
   integrated object-oriented data model and schema, the so-called product
   and production model, which covers all phases of the product life cycle.
   The model is implemented in a distributed and heterogeneous fashion
   using a CORBA-based object bus. On top of this bus, support for
   structured and ad-hoc collaboration is built around a uniform and
   flexible presentation layer: We motivate concurrent engineering and
   argue why we believe that it mandates a single, integrated schema. We
   then describe the overall architecture of the system and address various
   implementation issues, in particular object persistence, model
   evolution, presentation services and support for collaborative work.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new perspective on building control strategies for
   wastewater treatment plants and suggests a new indicator for evaluating
   the performance of these plants. The proposed approach is closer to the
   natural way in which these strategies are defined in case of real
   plants. Thus, the paper presents an incremental method on how to build
   control strategies, by going sequentially through various control
   actions, the results of applying a control action leading to the
   following actions that must be applied. Simultaneously the paper defines
   a new indicator for evaluating the performance of wastewater treatment
   plants: Global Warming Potential. This indicator is one component that
   arises from the Life Cycle Assessment analysis method and has the
   advantage that it provides information about the global environmental
   cost of operating the treatment plant. The study was carried out using
   the platform Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2).},

   energy efficient house: A case study},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {64-75},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {During planning and design stages of energy efficient houses investor
   and designer deal with requirement to ensure very low energy consumption
   in operational stage of building life cycle. Any deviation appeared
   after building commissioning will result non-compliance with regulatory
   requirements. Currently, the energy simulations of the residential
   building do not provide the approach, which would help comprehensively
   evaluate differences of occupants' characteristics (age, behaviour,
   etc.), neither in energy performance certification methodologies nor in
   energy simulation software. The objective of study is to perform complex
   analysis of the effect of domestic occupancy profiles on the energy
   performance of energy efficient house and assess applicability of
   default DesignBuilder occupancy profiles at local conditions. Results
   show that the influence of the profile with 4 occupants (OP2) on overall
   primary energy demand for different cases is never exceeding 5\%
   compared to default DesignBuilder profiles. The influence of households
   with 2 occupants (OP3, OP4) on overall primary energy demand varies from
   14\% to 21\% compared to default profiles. The simulation results
   revealed that the use of different occupancy profiles correlates with
   the total energy performance of the building. Incorporation of occupancy
   information in energy simulations will improve the accuracy of the
   energy performance assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The World Championship in Cybernetic Building Optimization (WCCBO) was
   held in 2019 to test participants' ability to optimize buildings
   cybernetically. Office buildings with a total floor area of 10,000 m(2)
   were built in cyberspace, one for each of the 33 participating teams.
   The cyber buildings were controlled by BACnet, and the participants
   competed to show their operational skills by tuning the HVAC system of
   their respective cyber buildings online. The ability of optimization was
   evaluated in terms of both energy consumption and thermal comfort, and
   their scores were published online in real-time. A total of 339
   different operations were tested during the two-month competition
   period. The top-ranked team succeeded in reducing energy consumption and
   thermally dissatisfied occupant rate by 12.1\% and 21.0\%, respectively.
   In this paper, we report on the examination of the rules and schedule of
   this championship as well as the analysis of the participants' scores.},

Abstract = {This article connects Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology
   with relational databases, presenting a large-scale framework that
   enhances work processes and knowledge for digital building asset
   management. It emphasizes the significance of data connections, aligning
   digital technologies with valuable information extraction and advocating
   for strategic digital continuity. Current digital procedures in
   construction often lack standardized protocols, hindering efficient
   information creation, monitoring, and reuse. The integration of BIM with
   other data sources facilitates better control in coordination and
   management, leading to time and cost savings throughout the asset
   lifecycle. The research is organized into four blocks: database
   construction, BIM data integration, quality control, and data
   consolidation, leading to a new systematization proposal for building
   management. Key contributions include insights into the global
   structuring of asset management information and the potential for
   synchronous use of BIM models with relational databases, enabling data
   sharing and access for various specialists across different
   environments.},

Title = {From digital models to numerical analysis for mechanised tunnelling: A
   fully automated design-through-analysis workflow},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {107},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Large infrastructure projects involving the construction of tunnels in
   urban areas constitute complex, integrated and multi-disciplinary
   systems, which require building and construction information modelling
   as well as computational design assessment tools for decision making
   during all project phases and during their complete life cycle. Even if
   the underlying information needed for computational analysis is stored
   in an information model, the translation to computational models is
   still cumbersome and requires significant manual work for model
   generation and set-up as well as excessive computing resources and time.
   To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a systematic summary
   of concepts for integrated information modelling, numerical analysis and
   visualisation for urban mechanized tunnelling. Our first approach
   ``BIM-to-FEM{''} is characterised by a fully automated link for
   error-free data exchange between a standalone Tunnelling Information
   Model and the process-oriented simulation model for mechanized
   tunnelling ``ekate{''}. In the second approach ``SATBIM{''}, a fully
   automated data exchange workflow is established between a parametric
   multi-level information model for tunnelling and multi-level numerical
   models based on both Finite Element and Isogeometric Analysis, where
   meta models are employed for real-time design assessment. We discuss the
   different applications of these concepts, such as scenario-based
   exploration of design alternatives, real-time design assessment within a
   TIM based on meta-models, and the potentials of using these models for
   the process control during construction. Furthermore, we present two
   case studies where real project data has been used for the integration
   of information and numerical modelling. The examples in this paper
   indicate clear advantages of this approach compared to traditional
   approaches in terms of efficiency of modelling achieved by reduced user
   interactions and error-free information exchange, and show the benefits
   of multi-level model representation and real-time analysis tasks.},

   Components of the Integrated Transport Infrastructure (ITI) of Slovakia,

   respecting the relevant requirements of users, residents and sustainable
   development throughout life cycle. Elements of ITI Slovakia, as
   important landscape ecological elements, should be designed with respect
   to aesthetic principles considering the cultural and natural wealth of
   Slovakia. Slovak technical universities have recently been criticized
   for teaching 50-years-old curriculum. The authors dare to disagree with
   the statement and, due to their scientific profile, pre-sent their
   partial outputs of a holistic approach to the sustainability of
   transport structures with a priority focus on pavement. In the
   intentions of the above mentioned, it could perhaps be partly

Abstract = {Purpose Current research efforts exhibit a surge imperative for a
   building information modelling (BIM) approach that embodies a repository
   of all relevant data of existing building components while monitoring
   and consistently recording numerous components' functions throughout its
   lifecycle, especially in Egypt. This research paper aims to develop an
   integrated as-is BIM-facility management (FM) information model for the
   existing building's components via a case study, depicting a repository
   for historical data and knowledge amassed from inspections and conveying
   maintenance decisions automatically during the FM practices.
   Design/methodology/approach The developed approach pursues four
   successive steps: data acquisition and processing of building
   components; components recognition from point clouds; modelling scanned
   point clouds; and quick response code information transfer to BIM
   components. Findings The proposed approach incorporates the as-is BIM
   with the building components' as-is FM information to portray a
   repository for historical data and knowledge collected from inspections
   to proactively benefit facility managers in simplifying, expediting and
   enhancing maintenance decisions automatically during FM practices.
   Originality/value This paper presents a digital alternative to manual
   maintenance recordkeeping concerning building components to retrieve
   their as-is and historical data using a case study in Egypt. This paper
   proposes a broad scan to as-is information BIM approach for the existing
   building's components to condone maintenance interventions using a
   versatile, affordable, readily available and multi-functional method for
   scanning the building's components using a handheld tool.},

   Building Information Modeling Collaboration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {A building lifecycle consists of multiple domains, and building
   information modeling (BIM) applications involve cross-domain knowledge
   exchange. In the knowledge spiral theory proposed by Nonaka,
   externalization facilitates knowledge exchange in designing cooperation,
   and a model library (ML) contains the necessary information for the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. However,
   current MLs are centralized systems that are vulnerable to data
   tampering and copyright disputes, and the provided models may not match
   the requirements of current building projects. Therefore, this article
   develops a blockchain-based parametric ML (BBPML) for BIM collaboration
   to realize knowledge sharing. The parametric model in our ML can be
   flexibly applied to a project by adjusting the parameters. A blockchain
   network provides reliable storage and ensures the upload sequence. The
   research creates a website based on the proposed system through Ethereum
   and applies it to a curtain wall project.
   This article applies the nonaka knowledge spiral theory to improve
   building information modeling (BIM) cooperation. A blockchain-based
   model library (ML) is proposed to facilitate knowledge sharing in BIM
   projects. The system records the building knowledge through a blockchain
   network to ensure the building knowledge is immutable and quickly
   traceable in the upload sequence. Our approach has been practiced in a
   physical curtain project and allows for better BIM collaboration.},

Title = {BIM-based environmental impact assessment for infrastructure design
   projects},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sustainability is becoming a key factor in the decision-making process
   of infrastructure projects throughout their lifecycles. In particular,
   the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the design phase is
   becoming a matter of significant importance, for both public and private
   sectors, given the long-term impacts of design decisions on the
   environmental performance of infrastructure projects. Traditionally, EIA
   is performed by a sustainability expert at the end of the design cycle,
   by which time the modification of design is both costly and
   time-consuming. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is
   leveraged to better integrate EIA with the design practices. However,
   there are several limitations with how this integration is approached:
   (1) EIA is normally performed by software other than the one used for
   the design. This renders the continuous EIA based on incomplete BIM
   models difficult; (2) there is a lack of explicit data structure for the
   integration of EIA and BIM data. This limits the interoperability and
   flexibility of the EIA tools in terms of accommodating to different EIA
   databases; (3) in the majority of the cases the integration of EIA and
   BIM is not bidirectional, which results in the incapacity of the
   designers to immediately visualize the results of EIA in the design
   platform and to track the progress of the design in terms of EIA; and
   (4) the BIM-based EIA has rarely been implemented in an infrastructure
   project. Therefore, this research aims to develop a continuous BIM-based
   EIA for infrastructure projects that utilizes an explicit data structure
   to (1) systematically integrate data from various sources, and (2)
   enable bidirectional data exchange between BIM and EIA. The framework
   allows designers to run an automated EIA at any point in the design
   stage and immediately assess the Environmental Impact Score (EIS) of
   their design choices. A prototype is developed and tested on a case
   study to indicate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The
   framework is assessed in terms of functionality, ease of use,
   scalability, and contribution to raising sustainability consciousness
   through a workshop with experts. It is shown that the framework is able
   to quickly provide designers with accurate information about the
   potential environmental impact of all objects in infrastructure design
   projects. The workshop with experts showed that the tool clearly makes
   it easier to perform EIA compared to the existing, highly fragmented,
   process. This allows the design team to use this assessment on the same
   level as other design parameters in the decision-making process.},

Abstract = {The building construction industry is continuously experiencing
   significant changes in practice because of the rapid development of new
   technologies, methods and materials. The industry stakeholders,
   including designers, engineers and contractors, are often forced to
   develop and implement creative and non-traditional strategies to keep up
   with the new trends while staying efficient, effective and competitive.
   Sustainability and green building practices are good examples of such
   new trends which became focal points building construction projects in
   the last decade. In this transition, construction contractors expanded
   their capabilities beyond traditional project delivery methods. The
   majority of top green building contractors in the United States maintain
   significant experience and expertise in Construction Management at Risk
   delivery method. This type of delivery places large emphasis on
   preconstruction making it a vital process in green building projects. In
   addition, sustainability and green building trends added different
   attributes to the preconstruction process beyond the traditional
   services. This paper aims to explore the differentiating characteristics
   of preconstruction services in green building projects in comparison to
   the traditional project delivery. The paper highlights the new
   qualifications that are increasingly expected from construction
   companies during the green building projects' preconstruction process.
   The additional attributes and abilities that are expected from the
   contractors are summarized in the paper including the ability to analyze
   innovative technology scope, effective use of building information
   modeling related technologies, energy modeling analysis, fundamental
   knowledge of ecology, and building life cycle cost analysis. The
   discussions provided in this paper provide a structured framework to
   introduce the green preconstruction process in the classroom as well as
   a source for construction contractors to expand their services.},

Abstract = {In connection with Ningbo Chenglang Bridge project's characteristics of
   complicated structure and mode, large horizontal scale, narrow
   construction yard, short construction period, etc., BIM technology is
   applied to direct construction of the project. Revit series software is
   applied to establish parametric model for Chenglang Bridge, and
   collision inspection, optimization of construction scheme, virtual
   construction and complicated process disclosure, etc. are finished.
   Through independent development of construction management platform,
   control on security, quality, and progress as well as cost are realized
   in bridge construction management. With satisfactory effect, the project
   provides reference for BIMapplication to like bridgework.
   Chenglang Bridge project has complicated structure and mode, large
   horizontal scale, narrow construction yard, short construction period.
   In the former experience-dominated construction method, the construction
   course is uncontrollable, and construction result is indefinite, prone
   to causing hard-to-estimated losses, so this method cannot meet actual
   demand any longer. Applying BIM technology to conduct virtual
   construction for bridge construction course before construction can
   decrease accidents and improve engineering quality. Meanwhile, this can
   facilitate construction units' coordinating construction sequence of
   different specialties, organizing in advance professional squad to enter
   the site for construction, preparing equipment, site and turnover
   materials, etc. to actualize informatized, visualized and integrated
   management over construction yard, course and complicated construction
   procedure, achieve dynamic control ({[}1]) over labor service, physical
   resources and cost in construction course. The owners suggested
   application of BIM technology to serve the project's construction in
   early planning period of project, and it is required to constantly
   explore BIM related techniques in practice to solve difficulties in
   actual project. The paper adopts BIM technology to construct Chenglang
   Bridge, realizes overall planning of project, explores construction
   management experience of application of BIM technology in full life
   cycle of bridgework, excogitates a set of key BIMtechnologies suiting
   bridgework, and lays some foundation for BIMapplication to future
   bridgework.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become the
   standard for managing the lifecycle of a building. The metadata embedded
   to BIM models can be used onsite to enhance field worker's view with
   relevant information about the task. Augmented Reality (AR) is a natural
   candidate for enabling onsite interactions with BIM models and data, due
   to its ability for overlaying digital information on top of real-world
   objects through a digital display. However, the complexity of BIM models
   and the limited hardware capabilities of AR-ready devices (e.g. head
   mounted and mobile devices), makes it difficult to provide reliable
   visualizations, decreasing considerably application's performance. This
   paper presents a type-1 Fuzzy Logic System (T1FLS) that helps optimizing
   loading of BIM 3D models in an AR application. Experiments results show
   that the proposed T1FLS has an average frame per second (FPS) rate of
   16.33 in the selected AR headset (Microsoft HoloLens). The FPS rate when
   using the proposed T1FLS is in average 2.33 times better than using a
   fixed batch size when loading BIM 3D objects.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) Execution Plan (BEP) is a complex
   process model used to represent the lifecycle process in modern building
   projects. The complexity is caused by the system of concurrent processes
   involved that are interdependent by means of information exchange
   requirements in the form of intermediate models and other information.
   Process oriented BEPs set the baseline for developing process maps which
   gives a visual representation of the interrelationships between and
   sequence of processes. But, there are different levels of details
   possible for processes and when details are more, process maps consumes
   enormous space making it unfeasible. This paper discusses various levels
   of details in which the BIM processes can be represented and
   demonstrates the application of Multi Domain Matrix (MDM) along with
   process maps. Analysis of MDM reveals more about the process
   architecture than visualisation in the process maps.},

Abstract = {Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly
   to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of
   energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies
   revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted
   into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK,
   Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies
   have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce
   electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the
   correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the
   building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the
   optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different
   choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas
   (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the
   Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy
   model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity
   cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings
   for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year.
   Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on
   energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This
   sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of
   energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44)
   is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum
   insulations (r = 0.14-0.29) which indicates the insulation range where
   more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the
   developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by
   selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a
   sustainable house. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the context of rapid technology development, the theory of using
   building information modelling (BIM) has been used in several historic
   places. With BIM technology, an accurate virtual model of a historic
   building is digitally constructed in order to maintain the building
   through its entire lifecycle, including demolition. This model, known as
   historic building information modelling (HBIM), represents a new
   paradigm within architectural heritage that can be used for creating,
   conserving, documenting, and managing complete engineering drawings and
   information. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to give an overview of
   the concepts, as well as surveying and representation techniques that
   are used in HBIM in order to support the process of further integration
   and demonstrate how the complexity of built heritage resources can be
   dealt with. In addition, the study presents a theoretical framework that
   has been constructed as a guide towards understanding the different
   aspects of historic preservation and management through a smart open
   platform.},

Abstract = {Research results on the development of an information support system for
   data integration from integrated production systems are presented. The
   way of information systems integration is offered. The corresponding
   method is based on data integration of information systems both for
   production purposes and for generating a subsystem of implementing the
   developed methods. As a result, this approach allows adopting optimal
   design and manufacturing solutions. The method is implemented using a
   universal PDM system and intermodulation software interface. The formal
   information models of data and methods of maintaining a full life cycle
   of information are created. This approach allows implementing the
   information support technology for the integration of production data. A
   functional-structural scheme for the implementation of the proposed
   method is described. The recommendations for practical use in the
   conditions of operating industrial enterprises are given. Developing
   this approach, the authors conducted a study on the formalization and
   modeling of design, production and normative reference data of the
   machine-building enterprise. Semantic modeling of data is carried out,
   design procedures for establishing their interconnections are developed.},

   Sustainable Buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The construction sector exerts great pressure on natural resources, and
   its role in the transition to a circular economy (CE) is fundamental.
   Despite the growing prominence of circular business models (CBMs), based
   on strategies of slowing and closing resource flows, there is
   uncertainty with regard to how to implement them in the construction
   sector. This study analyzed how the construction sector approaches
   business models (BMs) to achieve sustainable buildings. Through a
   systematic literature review, 89 articles were analyzed to (1) explore
   how the sector is implementing circular strategies; and (2) verify how
   these strategies are distributed in the BMs described in the literature.
   The review showed that CBMs are concentrated in clusters, with a focus
   on energy efficiency strategies and the search for more information and
   understanding of circular actions in the sector. From the results, a
   model for value creation and a framework were created to facilitate CBM
   implementation. The model is a roadmap for embedding the process of
   innovation and value creation in CBMs. The framework relates CBMs to the
   building life cycle, aiming to introduce circular principles into
   policies, actions, and value chains. This study contributes to
   innovation and value creation, associating BMs with the circular
   principle of closing the cycles of materials and systems in the
   construction sector.},

Title = {Implementing `BEAM Plus' for BIM-based sustainability analysis},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {163-175},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Escalating energy costs and the need to improve energy efficiency have
   increased public awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption over
   a building's entire lifecycle, and have prompted efforts to integrate
   green and sustainable building initiatives into the conventional
   building design, construction and operation processes. Sustainable
   building rating systems are being increasingly adopted to assess the
   sustainability performance of building design and construction. Building
   information modelling (BIM)-based technologies are regarded as a
   potentially useful vehicle for helping project stakeholders to capture
   complete design and project information, and to make the best use of the
   available design data for sustainable design and sustainability rating
   analysis. While experience from the Leadership in Environmental Energy
   and Design (LEED) programme in the US has demonstrated the great
   potential of integrating BIM with building assessments, it is
   anticipated that BIM can also be effectively integrated with the Hong
   Kong `BEAM Plus' sustainable building rating system. This study uses a
   two-stage method (i.e. a Delphi study and a case study) to explore the
   potential use of BIM in the case of a residential building project
   seeking BEAM Plus sustainable building certification in Hong Kong. The
   Delphi study indicated that 26 out of 80 credit points could potentially
   be achieved with the support of the documentation produced by BIM (i.e.
   Autodesk Revit). Detailed procedures for conducting and testing a
   BIM-based BEAM Plus sustainability analysis are described. The proposed
   BIM-BEAM Plus assessment framework is then verified using two sampled
   public housing modular flat models. The complexity of the BIM-BEAM Plus
   application depends on the project size, the extent of the model
   development detail and the nature of the project. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   Zones of China-A Deterministic Decision-Making Mechanism},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study aimed to develop a deterministic decision-making mechanism
   for finding the optimum set of retrofit solutions of existing high-rise
   residential buildings in two different climatic zones of China. The
   retrofit solutions were critically examined with different energy saving
   targets based on the local climatic conditions, building features, and
   retrofit costs in cold and severe cold zones comparatively. By making
   the extensive review and analyzing considerable statistics data and cost
   information, net present value (NPV) method was employed in the
   prototype building apartments to develop this deterministic model. The
   results demonstrated that the heating system is the most important
   factor in saving energy and obtaining the optimum revenue in these two
   regions. The highest optimal NPV can be obtained by achieving 60\%
   energy saving in the cold zone, as energy saving is around 319
   kWh/m(2)/year with the total retrofit costs of USD \$3560, while it is
   281 kWh/m(2)/year with the total retrofit costs of USD \$3480 to achieve
   the 50\% energy-saving target in the severe cold zone. Based on the
   analysis of energy savings and retrofit costs, the results can be
   effectively implemented for the purpose of creating sustainable
   retrofits in existing buildings, and the model can be adapted for
   selecting appropriate retrofit choices in other climatic zones.},

Title = {Embodied carbon assessment on road tunnels using integrated digital
   model: Methodology and case-study insights},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the constant increasing road tunnel construction in China, embodied
   carbon emissions of tunnels play an important role in addressing the
   issue of the low-carbon construction. This study determined the carbon
   emission boundary based on the characteristics of road tunnels and
   proposed a digital model based framework for evaluating embodied carbon
   emissions in road tunnels, thus realizing the rapid calculation and
   visualization of tunnel carbon emissions. Through two typical region
   cases of road tunnels in different regions, the usability and
   universality of this framework are verified. Based on the carbon
   emission calculation results of the tunnels, a systematic analysis was
   conducted on the proportion of carbon emissions in each stage of the
   tunnel and the carbon emission characteristics of the whole construction
   process. The results show that the material production stage of road
   tunnel has the largest carbon emissions proportion, accounting for about
   79\%-87\%, among which the carbon emissions contribution of concrete is
   the highest, followed by steel. Concrete and steel together account for
   about 90\% of carbon emissions during the tunnel material production
   stage. The carbon emissions of road tunnel increase with the
   deterioration of the surrounding rock. The embodied carbon in the
   secondary support step of road tunnel contributes the most to the total
   embodied carbon, and the carbon emissions difference of different
   tunnels is mainly reflected in the two steps of primary support and
   secondary support of road tunnel. The visual presentation of embodied
   carbon in road tunnel by digital model can help to achieve the purpose
   of reducing carbon emissions in tunnels.},

Abstract = {Building information Modelling (BIM) lies at the centre of construction
   industry's interest nowadays, with a revolutionary impact on the ways
   that professionals work, collaborate and conduct business. The
   application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with
   numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes
   across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and
   how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper
   performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape
   currently available for the construction industry across the various
   project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap
   analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different
   software application areas, software architecture, interoperability
   possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive
   statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented
   across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further
   hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated
   solutions addressed to advanced computer users. To this end, the paper
   aims to inform the industry's stakeholders, policy makers and software
   vendors, while shedding light on the extent that sophisticated BIM
   solutions can be disseminated to the market.},

Abstract = {The building industry is a traditional sector, with high environmental
   impacts and low productivity compared to other industries. Current
   research in digital fabrication is beginning to reveal its potential to
   improve the sustainability of the sector. However, evaluation methods
   are needed to quantify the actual reduction of environmental emissions
   compared to conventional construction. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   method is commonly employed for environmental evaluation of buildings.
   However, research on the integration of LCA in CAD and BIM software are
   only partially applicable to digital fabrication, because of differences
   in the design process. This study presents a design-integrated method
   for simplified LCA with the aim of integrating environmental criteria in
   the decision-making and optimization of digitally fabricated
   architecture. Finally, the paper presents the evaluation of the case
   study ``Mesh Mould{''}. The results prove the applicability of the
   method and highlight the environmental benefits that digital fabrication
   can provide.},

Title = {BIM-based integrated management workflow design for schedule and cost
   planning of building fabric maintenance},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) is the longest and costliest phase
   during the entire building lifecycle. In recent decades, with the
   rapidly increasing costs of new constructions, the effective maintenance
   has become more important to the existing buildings, particularly to
   their fabric components, which include both architectural and structural
   items for maintaining physical characteristics and ensuring normal
   performance of the existing building over its lifecycle. However,
   building maintenance costs are also increasing dramatically and this
   situation mainly results from the delay of maintenance work due to
   inefficient maintenance planning for the facility management purpose.
   The inefficient maintenance planning is caused due to lack of effective
   methods and techniques for predicting the uncertainties including
   schedule and costs during the maintenance stage. Therefore, this paper
   proposes an innovative management workflow design which integrates
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) with digital programming to
   implement efficient schedule and cost planning of building fabric
   maintenance. Through this BIM-based workflow design, the knowledge gap
   between maintenance theories and practical maintenance management can be
   narrowed by a consistent and sustainable building information flow,
   which is highly linked with the design and construction phase. This
   study makes a contribution to integrating the traditional maintenance
   management with digital technologies to improve the management
   performance and maintenance efficiency of the O\&M phase in the future.},

Abstract = {Computational building evaluation tools have the potential to provide an
   effective means to support informed design decision making.
   Computational modeling, however, comes with a cost. Thereby, the most
   important cost factor is not software acquisition, but the time needed
   for learning and using the software. The extent of required time and
   effort is believed to be one of the main hindrances toward the pervasive
   use of computational building performance assessment tools by designers:
   Currently, modeling applications are mostly used, if at all, in the
   later stages of design and by specialists, rather than architects.
   However, few studies have explicitly dealt with the ascertainment and
   quantification of the actual effort needed to understand, master, and
   apply computational building evaluation tools. Thus, little factual
   information is available as to the cost and burden of computational
   building evaluation and its effectiveness in building design support. In
   this context, the present paper describes a case study, whose motivation
   was to estimate the time and effort needed by novice designers to
   computationally evaluate the performance of building designs. A group of
   senior architecture students participated in the study, learning and
   using a software application to assess the energy performance of six
   project submissions for a school building design competition. The
   outcome of this study (time investment ranges for various components of
   the modeling activity) was evaluated and further extrapolated to
   estimate the effort needed for a more comprehensive computational
   assessment of the environmental performance of these designs. (c) 2004

Abstract = {The article substantiates the need for additional consideration of the
   requirements of the life cycle of designed systems by product developers
   in addition to the traditional control parameters. To date, the task of
   creating an autonomous, information system for the design and
   maintenance of ship installations, within which it would be possible to
   collect, systematize, analyze and manage all information about the
   simulated systems, the features of their operation to support decision
   making, is relevant. The article discusses the features of building
   distributed information systems with fuzzy clustering for designing and
   monitoring the operation of a marine engine. To formalize this process,
   it is necessary to develop a distributed information system of a marine
   engine, the nodes of which can simultaneously operate within the working
   space, the so-called fuzzy clustering approach regarding the design
   method, with finding new knowledge about the engine with highly
   efficient operation indicators. The basis of this system is the
   block-modular construction principle. The modules of the system will be
   based on mathematical models of different levels of complexity and
   hierarchy. A separate emphasis is placed on the need to use the
   block-modular principle of building information systems and the use of
   mathematical models that must meet the criteria of divergence,

Title = {Hash-Based Method for Generating Building Information Models From 2D CAD
   Drawings},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {147065-147072},
Abstract = {A building information model (BIM) encompasses the essential information
   required for a building's entire lifecycle, based on a 3D model.
   However, because building design begins with spatial planning, the
   initial design is based on a 2D plane. Furthermore, introducing BIM to
   general buildings is not effective in terms of modeling because of the
   design cost and the inherent 2D structure of older buildings.
   Consequently, research conducted over the past few years aimed to
   automatically generate 3D models from 2D drawings; however, the
   performance is limited in terms of data structure and methodology.
   Therefore, this study proposes a method that generates 3D information
   necessary for generating BIM models from 2D drawings using 2D hash-based
   data structures and planar graph analysis to resolve the above problem.
   Time and spatial complexities for planar graph generation from drawings
   consisting of n line segments among the proposed methods are O(kn) and
   O(n), respectively, where n is the number of the lines in drawing, k
   satisfies E(p) <= k <= n, and E(p) denotes the average number of
   intersections in each hash cell. By applying it to 2D drawing data used
   in actual architectures, a 3D model could be developed with
   approximately 2.9\% effort compared to the entire 2D drawing being
   modeled by a worker. This enables designers unfamiliar with BIM
   environments to conveniently obtain IFC files containing BIM models and
   then utilize BIM software to harness 3D information.},

Title = {Green Building Construction: A Systematic Review of BIM Utilization},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can
   assist construction organizations in improving their project's quality,
   optimize collaboration efficiency, and reduce construction periods and
   expenditure. Given the distinguished contributions of BIM utilization,
   there is a trend that BIM has significant potential to be utilized in
   the construction phase of green buildings. Compared with traditional
   buildings, green buildings have more stringent requirements, including
   environmental protection, saving energy, and residents' comfort.
   Although BIM is deemed an effective method to achieve the abovementioned
   requirements in the construction process of green buildings, there are
   few systematic reviews that explore the capabilities of BIM in the
   construction phase of green buildings. This has hindered the utilization
   of BIM in the construction of green buildings. To bridge this research
   gap and review the latest BIM capabilities, this study was developed to
   perform a systematic review of the BIM capabilities in the construction
   phase of green buildings. In this systematic review, the PRISMA protocol
   has been used as the primary procedure for article screening and review.
   The entire systematic review was performed from January 2022 to April
   2022. In this process, 165 articles were included, reviewed, and
   discussed. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the
   databases. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM
   capabilities have significant advantages in project quality improvement,
   lifecycle data storage and management, collaboration optimization,
   planning, and schedule management optimization in the construction phase
   of green buildings. Through the discussion, it can be concluded that BIM
   utilization can be adopted from the pre-construction phase to the
   post-construction stage in the green building construction process.
   Besides these, the barriers to BIM utilization in the green building
   construction phase are also revealed in the discussion section,
   including the non-uniform data format, insufficient interactivity,
   ambiguous ownership, insufficient BIM training, and hesitation toward
   BIM adoption. Moreover, the challenges and future directions of BIM
   utilization in green building construction are identified. The findings
   of this study can facilitate construction personnel to be acquainted
   with BIM capabilities in the construction of green buildings to promote
   the utilization and optimization of BIM capabilities in the green
   building construction process.},

Abstract = {The challenge that sustainable buildings movement faces is, ``how to
   maintain the intended sustainable performance with regards to low energy
   use, indoor comfort and projected operating costs savings over the long
   term use of the building{''} Rapid decline in sustainable performance of
   a few high-profile buildings affects credibility of the High Performance
   buildings initiatives, reinforces doubts amongst climate-change
   non-believers and slows down the enthusiasm of the investors. Examining
   the lifecycle performance and costs, raising the awareness of building
   owners and tenants, adopting the best operational and maintenance
   practices by trained and skilled operating staff, and incorporating
   measurements, verification and automation technologies to automatically
   track and optimize the performance of all key buildings systems needs to
   become an essential part of property management culture to avoid
   pitfalls.
   Emergence of Building Energy Labeling Program and Building Information
   modeling techniques coupled with energy use sub- metering can alert of
   issues during commissioning, building occupancy, tenant-fit ups,
   building-use changes or of decline in performance due to poor operations
   and maintenance management. Building Heating, Ventilation and Air
   Conditioning systems are significant users of energy as well as their
   operations and maintenance impacts the health and security of tenants.
   Therefore, proper design, configuration, commissioning, operations and
   maintenance of such systems continues to offer opportunities for
   reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, and any lapses in monitoring
   and correcting deficiencies creates shortfall in sustainable performance
   over the life of a building. As the largest single landlord in the
   United States, the Federal Government oversees about 500,000 federal
   buildings. With additional resources being made available under the
   Recovery Act funding, new tools are emerging to allow monitoring and
   control of energy use.
   This paper outlines various qualitative and quantitative measures that
   can be practiced to improve and sustain performance of all building
   systems and infrastructure elements. Amongst all the measures, having
   trained and motivated operations and maintenance staff involved from
   concepts stage through design, construction, commissioning, and
   operations not only facilitates meeting the original design intent, but
   also allows to make adaptive changes with changes in occupancy,
   functionality, codes, standards or security requirements. Such general
   practices can assure sustenance of energy and environmental performance
   over the life cycle of systems and buildings. This paper also emphasizes

Abstract = {The growing application of the BIM (Building Information Modelling)
   methodology shows that the BIM (Building Information Model) needs some
   agreed limitations in its universe of discourse in order to remain
   manageable and to solve the interoperability with other worlds, like the
   Building Automation System (BAS) modelling. The fast developing domain
   of energy-efficient design and operation of buildings has put strong
   pressure on such developments because the vast quantity of information
   and data models not originally belonging to the AEC/FM domain need to be
   made interoperable with the BIM model. We propose an interoperability
   method based on description logic ontology whose core is provided by a
   Link Model containing rules and constraints, not only to connect
   dynamically any kind of models, but also to allow sound quality control
   of the links by supporting knowledge-based management methods protecting
   the end-user from possible errors by the exponentially growing possible
   links with the increase of the level of needed detail.},

Title = {Service life prediction models for exterior stone cladding},
Journal = {BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {637-653},
Abstract = {The use of service life prediction tools can allow a more rational
   management of the maintenance of a building and its components by
   supporting reduced life cycle costs of constructed assets. A study was
   conducted to evaluate the degradation of facades of buildings located in
   Lisbon, Portugal, and in which visual in-situ inspections of 140 stone
   cladding facades were completed. Based on this information, different
   models were proposed to describe the degradation of masonry stone-clad
   buildings and a novel approach to predicting service life was developed.
   A description is provided for the use of artificial neural networks to
   predict the service life of stone cladding of the type that is directly
   adhered to a building substrate. With the use of artificial neural
   networks an analytical expression was established to estimate the
   degradation of this type of cladding system. The viability of this
   method was then compared with other methods used for service life
   prediction including multiple linear regression and a graphical method.
   Some of the statistical parameters used to assess the performance of the
   various methods are described. Of these three methods, those variables
   that best explain the degradation of stone cladding, are identified:
   cladding age, distance from the sea, type of finish, and size of the
   stone plates.},

Abstract = {Rapid advances in building information modelling (BIM) offer new
   opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the
   construction process and enhance the use of emerging technology
   throughout project's lifecycle, not only in buildings, but also in
   infrastructures. Although some researchers have promoted the use of BIM
   in infrastructures and several reviews in BIM implementation have been
   conducted; the comparative study of BIM implementation between building
   and infrastructure industry in a holistic view has not been identified.
   Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the extent to which level of
   BIM implementation has achieved in building and infrastructure
   industries. This exploration was performed differently from two main
   sources, namely, academic studies and industrial cases, where
   conventional reviews in BIM were mainly focused on academic publications
   only. More than forty case studies in academic journals and conference
   proceedings and twenty four BIM cases in industrial reports were
   collected and analysed to determine the current BIM uses and emerging
   BIM applications in both industries. The results show that (1) BIM case
   studies in academic journals show the high level of BIM implementation
   in practice; (2) the initial development of BIM in infrastructure can be
   referred to the existing BIM experience from the building industry; and
   (3) the comparative analysis of BIM in infrastructure and building cases
   highlights the support of new BIM use, enhanced of traditional project
   management and transformation of project delivery method.},

Abstract = {Integrated project systems hold the promise for improving the quality
   while reducing the time and cost of architecture/
   engineering/construction (AEC) projects. A fundamental requirement of
   such systems is to support the modeling and management of the design and
   construction information and to allow the exchange of such information
   among different project disciplines in an effective and efficient
   manner. This paper presents a methodology to implement integrated
   project systems through the use of a model-based approach that involves
   developing integrated ``smart AEC objects.{''} Smart AEC objects are an
   evolutionary step that builds upon past research and experience in AEC
   product modeling, geometric modeling, intelligent CAD systems, and
   knowledge-based design methods. Smart objects are 3D parametric entities
   that combine the capability to represent various aspects of project
   information required to support multidisciplinary views of the objects,
   and the capability to encapsulate ``intelligence{''} by representing
   behavioral aspects, design constraints, and life-cycle data management
   features into the objects. An example implementation of smart objects to
   support integrated design of falsework systems is presented. The paper
   also discusses the requirements for extending existing standard data
   models, specifically the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), to support
   the modeling of smart AEC objects.},

   Based on System Engineering},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The implementation of railway intelligent construction is the need of
   national strategic development and the demand of society. Based on the
   idea of system engineering, this paper proposes a three-dimensional
   railway intelligent construction system architecture composed of a full
   life cycle, management level and technical support. Based on this
   architecture, a ``three-step{''} implementation path is proposed. Then,
   it analyzes the technology support framework required in the
   architecture based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), incorporating
   Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS),
   algorithmic prediction and machine learning technology, Internet of
   Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technology, big data and cloud
   computing technology, and the application of railway intelligent
   construction system architecture is analyzed by taking a railway tunnel
   project in Zhejiang Province of China as an example. Finally, it
   discusses the problems that may be encountered in the implementation of
   railway intelligent construction and puts forward relevant suggestions.
   The results show that railway intelligent construction is an essential
   way. At present, China's railway intelligent construction is still in
   the primary stage. The design organization should do a good job in the
   top-level design and accumulate sufficient data for the later stage. All
   parties in the middle stage of construction should do a good job in the
   induction and integration of information and accumulate sufficient
   experience. In this way, we can integrate into the advanced stage and
   give full play to the advantages of software and hardware integrated
   applications such as BIM, IoT, big data, cloud computing and intelligent
   devices so as to truly realize the intellectualization and modernization
   of railway construction.},

Title = {How Spatial Analysis Can Help Enhance Material Stocks and Flows
   Analysis?},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Spatial information can be integrated into almost all fields of
   industrial ecology. Many researchers have shown that spatial proximity
   affects a variety of behaviors and interactions, and thus matters for
   materials stocks and flows analysis. However, normal tools or models in
   industrial ecology based on temporal dependence cannot be simply applied
   to the case of spatial dependence. This paper proposes a framework
   integrating material stocks and flows analysis with spatial analysis. We
   argue that spatial analysis can help data management and visualization,
   determine spatio-temporal patterns-processes-drivers, and finally
   develop dynamic and spatially explicit models, to improve the
   performance of simulating and assessing stocks and flows of materials.
   Scaling in spatial, temporal, and organizational dimensions and other
   current limitations are also discussed. Combined with spatial analysis,
   industrial ecology can really be more powerful in achieving its origin
   and destination-sustainability.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Facility management (FM) is the costliest stage in the building
   lifecycle of healthcare buildings. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   has potential solution to enable information management for healthcare
   FM. However, BIM is not used at FM due to its static nature, while
   healthcare FM requires dynamic information handling. The FM systems in
   practice and literature require either implementation of WebGL-HTML5
   applications that necessitates coding knowledge for updates or data
   analysis. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a healthcare FM system
   based on Big Data Analytic (BDA), BIM and Not only SQL (NoSQL) database
   to enable FM information query and FM-KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
   visualization. The proposed system is developed through Design Science
   Research methodology. Findings show that the system is effective and
   practical to perform FM data retrival and analysis by practioners in
   healthcare facilities management effec-tively.},

Abstract = {Data loss and communication problems may arise especially in complex
   construction projects, which in turn may result in poor project
   performance. Interoperability smooths communication while increasing
   information management quality. The aim of this paper is to investigate
   the interoperability research gaps and trends in Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) for architecture, engineering, construction, operation,
   and facility management (AECO/FM). This study adopted a holistic
   approach with a bibliometric search, a scientometric mapping and
   analysis of interoperability in BIM research. Data about
   interoperability in BIM were collected through an examination of 477
   articles that were selected from the Scopus database. This study
   contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the research trend
   and gaps in key areas, and their relationship with interoperability in
   BIM. As results suggest, future studies should focus on interoperability
   in BIM to increase knowledge-integrated, ontology-based, IT-based
   managed, collaborative, automated, well-visualized, and sustainable
   outcomes throughout the project lifecycle.},

Title = {Bottom-up model for the sustainability assessment of rooftop-farming
   technologies potential in schools in Quito, Ecuador},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {274},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Rooftop-farming technologies can transform unexploited roofs into
   agricultural areas; and though studies have quantified the
   sustainability of diverse rooftop-farm systems, researchers lack a
   direct comparison between these farms using a unified sustainability
   index. Therefore the proposed bottom-up model aims to quantify the
   sustainability of rooftop-farm technologies application in school
   building stocks, thus permitting an objective comparison and ultimately
   selection of the best-fitted farm system. This model handles large
   building samples by combining Statistical Mining Techniques with the
   Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment. It uses data on
   the economic, environmental and social aspects of the farms, and relates
   them to the technical limitations and functionality found in the host
   buildings. The model has three consecutive stages: 1) in the City Stage
   reference buildings are identified from the stock, 2) the Building
   Information Stage determines the logistics and infrastructure
   requirements; and, 3) the Farm Technology Stage quantifies the farms'
   sustainability. This model was used to assess the potential
   implementation of three rooftop-farms (edible-green roofs, rooftop
   greenhouses and integrated rooftop greenhouses) in the primary school
   stock in Quito, Ecuador. Two reference buildings represented the primary
   school stock of the city; and, in both typologies, edible-green roofs
   obtained the highest sustainability values of 0.62 and 0.65. The
   environmental pillar was the most discriminant in which green-roofs
   achieved twice the sustainability values for the rooftop-greenhouses due
   to their larger rainwater harvesting capacity, thermal resistance and
   contribution to the increment of urban greenspaces. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Comparison analysis on simplification methods of building performance
   optimization for passive building design},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {216},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Building performance optimization (BPO) is effective for designers to
   explore passive building alternatives based on defined performance
   metrics. As the first step of BPO, the simplification of design problems
   has been performed in diverse methods. However, its identification and
   selection are still a challenge. This study firstly develops a
   simplification matrix based on two criteria of complexity and
   flexibility to categorize existing passive design options. Secondly,
   four simplified configurations are compared to evaluate their impact on
   the quality and correlation of optimized solutions. A prefabricated
   building was selected as the case study, and three performance metrics
   were defined as energy use intensity, thermal discomfort ratio and
   dissatisfaction of daylight illuminance. In the results, the
   low-complexity model with high flexibility outperforms the other
   simplifications with expected improvements of 20.16\%, 15.14\% and
   47.09\% for three metrics. However, the difference in improvements
   between low-and high-flexibility models lies within 2\%. Based on the
   results, the low-complexity model with low flexibility would be the most
   promising simplified method, as it can integrate engineering information
   into BPO with a negligible performance gap. Moreover, it is also found
   that the correlation varies significantly between low-and
   high-complexity models, which is caused by the variation of the
   transparent parameter from window to glass. Finally, the multi-objective
   genetic algorithm II has an advantage in convergence speed over the
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II.},

Title = {Blockchain-aided information exchange records for design liability
   control and improved security},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies
   in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with
   little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties
   collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they
   transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative
   practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves.
   This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in
   claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages
   results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and
   compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data
   integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity
   (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain
   technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research
   method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to
   identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping
   on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and
   evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project
   processes, design review, design coordination and request for
   information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and
   post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The
   prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of
   individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a
   clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves
   the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the
   auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from
   such a system are independent of any third-party storage or
   subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the
   existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its
   associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore,
   BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing
   information exchange systems.},

   reliability of facilities evaluation. STEEP (social, technical,
   economic, environmental, and policy) criteria and their sub-criteria are
   used to set up an ANP (analytic network process) model, and ANP result
   such as synthesized priority weights is then used to calculate those
   parameters related to facilities intelligence. An experimental case
   study is given to prove the effectiveness of applying the proposed

Abstract = {Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems at the building scale
   can not only reduce building energy consumption but also further promote
   the sustainable development of our society. To enhance the utilization
   of BIPV systems, this paper reviews their feasibility and applicability
   in regions with high solar irradiance from many perspectives.
   Specifically, this paper first investigates the application advantages
   of the BIPV system in terms of the energy supply and aesthetic value of
   buildings. Subsequently, several performance influencing factors of the
   BIPV in regions with high solar irradiance are analyzed independently,
   such as the PV module temperature, solar radiation intensity, PV module
   orientation and tilt angle, PV module types, and inverter.
   Simultaneously, the feasibility of the BIPV system in high
   solar-irradiance regions is systematically assessed in terms of energy
   efficiency, environmental benefit, and economic performance. And an
   ideal coordination model is highlighted to promote the development of
   the BIPV system. Additionally, the future research direction of the BIPV
   system in these regions is explored. Overall, this paper can provide
   valuable information for the development of BIPV systems in regions with
   high solar irradiance.},

Abstract = {Heritage BIM can represent many advantages for heritage building
   documentation, restoration, retrofitting and management. However, the
   most complicated challenge concerning H BIM is the inevitability of
   starting at an intermediate point in the asset's life cycle, which can
   be much more complex than the relatively straightforward cradle-to-grave
   model that describes new-build construction (Historic England, 2017).
   This leads to irregular geometry, non-homogeneous materials, variable
   morphology, not documented changes, damage and various stages of
   construction. These challenges put more weight on the surveying,
   documentation, modelling and visualisation phase within the process of
   HBIM.
   Many investigation tools can be used and combined to document and
   investigate the fabric of historic buildings. This paper reviews the
   literature and the state of art of the different domains of data that
   could be included in the documentation and investigation process of the
   built heritage, in order to assess the breadth and depth by which
   heritage buildings can be documented. These data can vary from outer
   geometry survey, to sub-surface materials and structural integrity
   investigations, to data concerning the building performance, as well as
   the historic records concerning the building's morphology over time,
   which can help to create a more in-depth knowledge about the heritage
   buildings' status and performance and can create a solid base for any
   required restoration and retrofitting processes.},

Title = {A BIM-based carbon footprinting of earthworks in road construction
   process},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions are a major component of greenhouse gases and
   their evaluation during the life cycle of civil infrastructures is
   increasingly becoming a pivotal criterion for project tendering. During
   construction activities, the use of heavy-duty vehicles generally
   accounts for most of the energy consumption. However, the CO2 emissions
   deriving from earthwork machines have not been thoroughly calculated yet
   due to the inner complexity of such task. In this regard, this research
   streamlines a quantitative assessment process of carbon dioxide
   leveraging digital tools and considering a bicycle lane project
   stretching approximately 3 km in Trondheim, Norway. Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) is adopted to define the necessary earthwork operations
   and provide accurate data to appraise quantity take-off volumes. Three
   earthwork tasks, namely excavation, transport and compaction, are
   investigated. The corresponding CO2 emissions are subsequently
   quantified considering three operating modes for excavator (idling,
   moving and working), three types of transport vehicles (wheel dozer,
   tractor scraper and articulated dump truck) and two models of compaction
   machines (sheepsfoot and vibratory rollers). The results indicate that
   75.5 t CO2 emissions are generated from the on-site heavy machines. In
   particular, the transport activities contribute to the largest
   proportion of CO2 emissions (56 \%), half of which is produced while
   moving excess soil to the dump pit. Besides, the amount of carbon
   dioxide (2.9 t) generated during the idling and moving statuses of
   excavator is not negligible. Therefore, an optimized construction
   workflow and proper planning process are required to reduce machine fuel
   consumptions as well as increase the working efficiency. Bearing in mind
   the strategic importance represented by early planning for sustainable
   construction activities, this study provides innovative insights
   regarding the assessment of carbon footprints generated by earthwork
   machines.},

Title = {Innovative building technologies 4.0: Fast-tracking housing delivery
   through 3D printing},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {117},
Number = {11-12},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {A house fulfils a fundamental need for human habitation. Acquisition of
   a house (through purchase or construction) is probably one of the
   greatest expenses for most people in South Africa. However, the complex
   South African housing industry has two markets: one market financed by
   the private sector and the other subsidised by the government. Despite
   several measures put in place by the government, the housing backlog in
   South Africa is still unacceptably high, at more than 2.3 million
   houses.(1)
   Furthermore, in South Africa, there have been challenges of limited
   uptake of innovative building technologies in house construction.
   Fairclough 2 and Burger' have noted that innovations have changed how
   homes are made in many countries, their performance, affordability, and
   functionality. Although the South African regulatory environment is not
   prescriptive in the materials and products used in building
   construction, there has been a slow uptake of innovative building
   products compared to that in other countries. In this article, the term
   `innovative building products' refers to any non-conventional building
   products that have been assessed and certified by Agrement South
   Africa{''} (www.agrement.co.za). There are no South African National
   Standards to assess the performance of these products. The use of
   innovative building products in South Africa has important economic
   ramifications, including eradicating the housing backlog, providing
   better-quality housing and construction products, and possibly reducing
   the life cycle cost of the houses.
   South Africa can deliver more than 160 000 houses and 80 000 houses per
   year in the government subsidised and private sectors, respectively, as
   evidenced in the 2008/2009 financial years shown in Figure 1. Since
   2009, the delivery of government subsidised houses has been dropping at
   an alarming rate, indicating serious intervention required by government
   and private developers in the home-built environment. This, therefore,
   requires a change: an exploration of how innovation, in its broad
   context, can be utilised to examine the structure, characteristics, and
   technologies available to accelerate the delivery of houses.
   A general reluctance bythe construction industryto embrace technological
   advancement has meant that productivity is low, outdated, and lacking in
   dynamism and creativity. There are various contributory factors. For
   example, there is an insufficient collaboration between technology
   suppliers and contractors, inadequate knowledge transfer from one
   project to the next, fear and anxiety by built environment professionals
   to explore innovative ideas and solutions, and misperceptions on cost
   and acceptability of the technologies. However, the construction
   industry is well positioned to refine its business-as-usual productivity
   and efficiency models and embrace technological advances such as
   building information modelling, 3D printing, and augmented reality.' 6
   This article explores the potential of using 3D printing technologies to
   fast-track the delivery of quality houses in South Africa.},

Abstract = {The EcoBalance Model was developed at VTT, the Technical Research Center
   of Finland, in the early 1990s, and it has been used in several case
   studies in Finland. The model estimates the total consumption of energy
   and other natural resources, the production of emissions and wastes, and
   the costs caused directly and indirectly by residential areas and urban
   structures on a life-cycle basis. The results of the case studies give
   information about the ecological impacts of different solutions in urban
   development. The case study introduced in this article indicates that
   eco-villages are not necessarily very sound from an ecological point of
   view. On average, eco-villages require more energy and raw materials,
   they produce more emissions, and they cost more than urban small-house
   areas. The EcoBalance model can be used when planning new areas or
   developing new urban structures, constructing buildings and
   infrastructure, as well as developing sustainable life styles. (C) 2000

   facilitates the definition of a formal dialog in the alignment design.
   In relation to this, new building blocks and life-cycle phases have been

Abstract = {In the domain of Facility Management (FM), the implementation of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) poses significant challenges for
   the Facility Operation Manager (FOMr) in terms of effective integration
   into their regular workflow. Employing the Soft Systems Methodology
   (SSM), this study highlights a conducive environment that enhances the
   usability of BIM for the FOMr. By expanding the application scenarios of
   BIM within the FM field, we contribute to completing the lifecycle of
   building models. We introduce `Text-based Building Information' (TxBI),
   a system designed to complement Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) while
   emphasizing a text-centric approach. TxBI strategically focuses on
   systematically integrating Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP)
   components, which are pivotal for daily FM operations. It generates a
   simple yet versatile dataset derived from the as-built BIM deliverable,
   channeling it to Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) and
   streamlined 3D systems. The utility of TxBI is exemplified through its
   application in commercial software environments, showcasing the creation
   of lightweight digital twins of completed buildings. Significantly
   enhancing FOMrs' access to building information, TxBI establishes a more
   versatile data environment for all building stakeholders. The
   accumulation of comprehensive information throughout the Operation and
   Maintenance (O\&M) phase culminates in enhanced asset management and
   extended longevity of buildings.},

Title = {Research on the impact of information sharing and government subsidy on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {467},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {From the perspective of promoting the compliant recycling of retired
   power batteries, this paper considers a power battery recycling supply
   chain dominated by the electric vehicle battery (EVB) manufacturer,
   where the formal and informal recyclers compete for recycling. Battery
   information sharing between the EVB manufacturer and the formal recycler
   is proposed firstly and based on this, government subsidy for the formal
   recycler is proposed then. By establishing models and comparing the
   equilibrium results, the recycling prices, recycling quantities and
   profit changes of supply chain members under different scenarios are
   obtained. The study shows that battery information sharing and
   government subsidy can promote more retired power batteries to enter
   formal channels and inhibit the development of informal recyclers. In
   addition, under the battery information sharing model, government
   subsidy can improve the formal recycler's profit loss due to battery
   information sharing. The proposal of these measures provides a
   development direction worthy of reference for the recycling of EVBs and
   is conducive to building a benign power battery full life cycle system.},

Abstract = {Building information models (BIMs) have proven to be data-rich,
   object-oriented, intelligent, and parametric digital representations of
   buildings to support diverse activities throughout the lifecycle of the
   building. Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects
   in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have
   complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus,
   incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one
   of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities
   management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM
   for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive
   process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers.
   Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for
   constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for
   effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end,
   this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art
   technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first
   step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is
   BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps:
   (1)data capturing and processing, (2)object recognition, and (3)as-is
   BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used
   in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed.
   Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future
   development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are
   identified. This paper presents the results of systematic review and
   analyses for image-based as-is BIM construction processes, contributing
   to the development and widespread adoption of this technology in the
   construction industry. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Capturing knowledge has always been an objective although known to be
   costly and time consuming. Onto logics, being ``an explicit
   specification of a conceptualization{''}, have tried to capture
   knowledge through concepts that, in some cases, are used to represent a
   domain entity, relations between the domain concepts, functions, axioms
   and instances.
   This paper describes an ontology for the Portuguese Air Force
   Headquarters (Estado Major da Forca Aerea - EMFA), reporting also on the
   ontology building process, its life cycle, applied methodologies,
   decisions taken and results achieved.
   The sources of information, used in the knowledge acquisition phase,
   consisted mainly of the EMFA organization book, the Internet, and text
   analysis techniques, as well as interviews, brainstorming and
   cross-validation sessions. Conceptualization consisted on the
   identification of concepts and classes while building classification
   trees. The resulting EMFA ontology comprehends six main modules covering
   the key concepts of the military organization domain. All modules were
   cross-validated in several meetings and informal competency questions
   were used in order to verify the usefulness of the ontology.},

Abstract = {Building Information Models are being increasingly accepted as
   containers and managers of data during the lifecycle of buildings, given
   their capacity of associating the descriptive data available, such as
   the physical properties of the materials, with the 3D representation of
   the building. In the case of existing buildings, as-built BIMs have to
   be created, and non-destructive techniques are required to acquire all
   the information needed provoking no disruption or change to the
   building. In this work, the as-built BIM of a facility is created
   through the semi-automated processing of a laser scanning point cloud
   and enriched with the different U-values of the enclosure. This
   thermophysical property is obtained for the construction as-is through
   an energy balance using temperature values measured with a thermographic
   camera. The resulting as-built BIM is defined according to the gbXML
   language, which was especially created to be used in analysis of the
   performance of the building. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have proliferated and adapted to
   public development in recent decades; within it, the value for money
   (VfM) assessment defines the feasibility of the project procurement
   model as one of the essential components of PPP. However, evaluating the
   VfM in PPPs remains problematic. Given concerns about PPP profitability,
   a more integrated VfM evaluation is urgently needed to manage multiple
   indicators along the project lifecycle. Building information management
   (BIM), popular in architecture, engineering, and construction, provides
   resources that could support the VfM to a great extent. This paper uses
   a review approach to identify the current issues that are affecting VfM
   assessments and suggests that BIM, functioning throughout the PPP
   lifecycle, could support decision-making in VfM processes in order to

Abstract = {The data record contains Material Intensity data for buildings (MI). MI
   coefficients are often used for different types of analysis of

   Until now, MI values were compiled and reported ad-hoc with few

   material intensity data points from 33 studies and provide the results
   in a comprehensive and harmonized database. Material intensity is
   reported as kilograms per gross floor area for 32 materials as primary
   data points. Furthermore, we augmented the data with secondary
   attributes for regional information, such as climate and socioeconomic
   indicators. The data are hosted on the version control platform GitHub
   using accessible data formats and providing detailed contribution
   guidelines. This ``database seed{''} facilitates data analysis,
   accessibility, and future data contributions by the research community.
   In the Technical Validation we illustrate that consistency of the data
   and opportunities for further analysis. This database can serve
   scientists from various disciplines as a benchmark to determine typical

Title = {A new technology acceptance model: a mixed-method of grounded theory and

Abstract = {Purpose
   The Iranian construction industry has been grappling with numerous
   problems in recent years, including rework, high costs and design
   errors. Engineers in this field have always highlighted the use of
   modern technological methods of construction to improve quality and
   productivity and reduce time and cost. One of these technologies is the
   so-called building information modeling (BIM), which has been very
   difficult to adopt and implement in Iran. The purpose of this study is
   to propose a systemic and holistic model to analyze the dynamics of
   adoption and implementation of BIM in this country. The purpose of this
   paper is to understand the dynamics of BIM acceptance to identify the
   most effective policy to maximize it in the Iranian manufacturing
   industry.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A two-stage methodology has been developed to achieve the purpose of the
   research. In the first stage, a technology acceptance model for BIM
   acceptance was developed using the grounded theory (GT) method. This
   conceptual model provides a holistic basis for building a simulation
   model. Thus, in the second stage, we used the dynamics system
   methodology to extract a dynamic model from the conceptual one. This
   dynamic model can simulate different policies and may be used to
   evaluate their respective effectiveness.
   Findings
   In this study, using the GT method, we obtained 510 primary codes, 118
   secondary codes, 50 concepts and 17 categories. After determining the
   relationships between categories through axial coding, we reached a
   conceptual model based on selective coding. Mention some of the
   variables of the conceptual model. Awareness, security, perceived
   usefulness and perceived ease of use are some of the most important
   variables of this model. In the next part, this conceptual model was run
   using system dynamics and, thus, turned into a causal model in which all
   the effective variables on BIM technology and their relationships with
   each other are specified. The stock and flow diagram of the problem and
   its related equations were presented. To improve the model and solve the
   problem, we examined the four policies as four future scenarios on the
   model: continuing the status quo, development of specialist workforce
   training, bolstering governmental support and increasing awareness via
   advertisement within. The simulation results showed that government
   support is the most effective policy for maximizing BIM acceptance in
   Iran.
   Practical implications
   In addition to enumerating all the factors affecting BIM technology,
   this paper proposes a systemic model that provides an accurate and
   comprehensive view of the acceptance of this technology. In this regard,
   by introducing feedback loops, as well as reinforcing and balancing
   factors versus factors causing stasis, the model offers a much deeper
   insight into mechanisms associated with BIM development and its
   barriers. Therefore, this study provides a very useful perspective and
   basis for policy-makers and all stakeholders to accept and implement BIM
   technology. The findings of this study can lead to more accurate
   policy-making, removal of acceptance barriers, promotion of incentives,
   and consequently more effective acceptance of BIM technology.
   Originality/value
   In this study, a new mixed research method was used. The innovation of
   our study lies in its simultaneous use of GT method to construct an
   accurate and holistic model and applying the system dynamics methodology
   to build a holistic and systemic model of the BIM acceptance problem.
   This research also provides a suitable standard and tool for studying
   BIM technology in developing countries.},

Abstract = {The economic success of a real estate project needs to be assessed at an
   early stage of the development process.The decision to realise a project
   is based on uncertainties such as the planned project costs, the
   expected rental income and the type and degree of utilsation to which it
   will be used. A real estate object comprising a building structure and a
   site (property) is unique at the highest level. The building can,
   however, be composed/concatenated from non-unique components and rooms
   assigned to/specified for different types of use. The size and equipment
   of these components and rooms are known from completed projects, as they
   have already been planned and built numerous times. This information is
   used to determine building costs by defining standard room structures on
   the basis of room functionalities containing information down to item
   level, which is normally only available from the execution planning.This
   is a theoretically and practically sound model whose cause-effect
   relationships have been derived quantitatively and confirmatorily.The
   input variables are to be specified by the developer according to the
   functional operation. Composing the entire building from standard rooms
   leads to a detailed building target content at item level including
   item-related quantities. As a result, the model provides all building
   cost broken down according cost groups and service areas. Future
   investment costs are also determined by linking the respective items to
   the lifetimes of the associated components. This allows the developer to
   optimize the entire building beyond the production costs on the basis of
   life cycle cost. The following article is intended to provide a summary
   overview of this methodology and its applications in recent years.},

Title = {Unravelling the mystery of Chinese building lifetime: A calibration and
   verification based on dynamic material flow analysis},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Pages = {442-452},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Building lifetime is a crucial parameter for modelling building stock's
   turnovers and related dynamics of embodied and operational energy
   demand. However, it is poorly characterized and often based on
   assumptions (especially for developing countries such as China), because
   no or few empirical data are available. Here we combined a top-down
   dynamic material flow analysis method with bottom-up information (i.e.,
   age profile of residential building stock, per capita residential floor
   area, and population) to calibrate the lifetimes of Chinese buildings
   from 1950 to 2015. We contrasted the top-down estimates with existing
   literature and primary data from on-site surveys to verify the
   plausibility of calibrated building lifetimes. We found an overall
   downward trend of building lifetimes during 1950-1989 and a gradual
   climb-up since 1990s. However, the present Chinese building lifetime
   appears still far below the design lifetime (50 years). Up to 2015, the
   floor areas of Chinese building stock has reached an enormous level of
   64.7 billion m(2); on the per capita basis, it has reached 30.5 and 15.7
   m(2) for residential and non-residential use, respectively. The yearly
   demolished floor areas have reached at a level of 1.6 billion m(2). The
   improved building lifetimes can enhance our understanding of building
   stock's turnovers and vintage-based energy performance and thus help
   better characterize life cycle energy demand of building stocks and
   beyond. To further the use of the calibrated building lifetimes,
   modelers and data users should also be aware of the variable building
   lifetimes and have a structured overview of data sources and their
   inconsistency.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is an important part of the economic sector of
   a country, therefore, it is important to verify the new management
   systems that are implemented in the main construction industries of the
   world. This article makes a bibliographic review of the Lean
   Construction (LC) philosophy, introduced by Professor Lauri Koskela in
   1992, based on the model used by the automobile industry in the 1980s,
   called ``Lean production{''}. The theoretical bases of LC intend to see
   production in construction as a process of transformation, flow and
   value generator, consequently, the objective of Lean Construction is to
   create good production systems that allow optimizing, reducing, or
   eliminating flows to improve delivery times. Within the framework of
   creating Lean tools to improve the management of construction projects,
   the Last Planner System arises to improve the work scheduling process
   and the Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) model, which by unifying it
   with LC becomes the Lean Project Delivery System (LPDS) project
   execution system, which proposes the methodology to develop construction
   projects under five phases and 12 ``Lean{''} stages, in which the
   development of tools that contribute to the generation of value.
   Finally, the 3D Building Information Modeling (BIM) modeling technology,
   although not part of LC, is an important help tool for the LPDS model,
   helping to better understand the construction processes of complex
   designs to save time in their construction. Under this paradigm, the
   emergence of new tools gives us a better vision of the future of Lean
   Construction.},

Abstract = {Defects presented on the facades of a building do have profound impacts
   on extending the life cycle of the building. How to identify the defects
   is a crucial issue; destructive and non-destructive methods are usually
   employed to identify the defects presented on a building. Destructive
   methods always cause the permanent damages for the examined objects; on
   the other hand, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been widely
   applied to detect those defects presented on exterior layers of a
   building. However, NDT methods cannot provide efficient and reliable
   information for identifying the defects because of the huge examination
   areas. Infrared thermography is often applied to quantitative energy
   performance measurements for building envelopes. Defects on the exterior
   layer of buildings may be caused by several factors: ventilation losses,
   conduction losses, thermal bridging, defective services, moisture
   condensation, moisture ingress, and structure defects. Analyzing the
   collected thermal images can be quite difficult when the spatial
   variations of surface temperature are small. In this paper the authors
   employ image segmentation to cluster those pixels with similar surface
   temperatures such that the processed thermal images can be composed of
   limited groups. The surface temperature distribution in each segmented
   group is homogenous. In doing so, the regional boundaries of the
   segmented regions can be identified and extracted. A terrestrial laser
   scanner (TLS) is widely used to collect the point clouds of a building,
   and those point clouds are applied to reconstruct the 3D model of the
   building. A mapping model is constructed such that the segmented thermal
   images can be projected onto the 2D image of the specified 3D building.
   In this paper, the administrative building in Chaoyang University campus
   is used as an example. The experimental results not only provide the
   defect information but also offer their corresponding spatial locations
   in the 3D model.},

Title = {Concert Halls as Nearly Adaptive Spaces},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Concert halls have led to increasingly complex spaces that cannot be
   thought of as static `containers' anymore. This complexity makes them
   viable to be launched towards industry 4.0 and to be considered a
   function of the activities that they can provide during their life
   cycle. They are characterized by dynamic objects that contain
   sophisticated sub-systems and add to the capability to influence both
   environmental variables and user behavior. This article explains an
   adaptive concert hall at an early stage, in which a network of sensors
   that gather real-time data on environmental factors such as temperature,
   air humidity and air velocity are considered, focusing on their direct
   and indirect intercorrelations with the acoustic quantities to optimize
   the room acoustic response. The proposed methodology is controlled by a
   digital twin (DT) based on building information modeling (BIM),
   integrated with sensors, actuators, and acoustic measurements and
   algorithms. By analyzing the data, algorithms identify patterns, and an
   autonomous fine-tune setting is achieved, including the novelty for
   which a natural variable acoustic field becomes possible during a
   musical execution without the use of any electroacoustic system support.
   The hall becomes a natural active instrument to be included in the

Title = {From complex questionnaire and interviewing data to intelligent Bayesian
   network models for medical decision support},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {75-93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: (1) To develop a rigorous and repeatable method for building
   effective Bayesian network (BN) models for medical decision support from
   complex, unstructured and incomplete patient questionnaires and
   interviews that inevitably contain examples of repetitive, redundant and
   contradictory responses; (2) To exploit expert knowledge in the BN
   development since further data acquisition is usually not possible; (3)
   To ensure the BN model can be used for interventional analysis; (4) To
   demonstrate why using data alone to learn the model structure and
   parameters is often unsatisfactory even when extensive data is
   available.
   Method: The method is based on applying a range of recent BN
   developments targeted at helping experts build BNs given limited data.
   While most of the components of the method are based on established
   work, its novelty is that it provides a rigorous consolidated and
   generalised framework that addresses the whole life-cycle of BN model
   development. The method is based on two original and recent validated BN
   models in forensic psychiatry, known as DSVM-MSS and DSVM-P.
   Results: When employed with the same datasets, the DSVM-MSS demonstrated
   competitive to superior predictive performance (AUC scores 0.708 and
   0.797) against the state-of-the-art (AUC scores ranging from 0.527 to
   0.705), and the DSVM-P demonstrated superior predictive performance
   (cross validated AUC score of 0.78) against the state-of-the-art (AUC
   scores ranging from 0.665 to 0.717). More importantly, the resulting
   models go beyond improving predictive accuracy and into usefulness for
   risk management purposes through intervention, and enhanced decision
   support in terms of answering complex clinical questions that are based
   on unobserved evidence.
   Conclusions: This development process is applicable to any application
   domain which involves large-scale decision analysis based on such
   complex information, rather than based on data with hard facts, and in
   conjunction with the incorporation of expert knowledge for decision
   support via intervention. The novelty extends to challenging the
   decision scientists to reason about building models based on what
   information is really required for inference, rather than based on what
   data is available and hence, forces decision scientists to use available
   data in a much smarter way. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Automatic Generation of 3D Building Models Based on Line Segment
   Vectorization},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Operations and maintenance (O\&M) management for existing buildings is
   of high importance since it consumes the most cost during buildings'
   lifecycle. Its effectiveness could be significantly improved through the
   systematic use of building information modeling (BIM). However, BIM
   relies on full-fledged digital models, which, for most buildings, are
   not available. This paper introduces a recognition algorithm aiming at
   the automatic generation of 3D building models from 2D drawings. The
   algorithm is able to generate separated wall segment 3D models with
   their topology relations. The algorithm is implemented and tested by
   several real projects. The results are very promising and show that the
   proposed algorithm could be a key component of future digital toolkits
   for O\&M management.},

   change or updating may discontinue the production of any industry.
   Future forecast of the product will give time to switch over in new
   product. Forecasting is an important factor, to the most basics
   processes in any organization, to plan and deliver products. To be able
   to predict next purchases is a valuable thing to marketing. The
   methodology used in this paper is based on machine learning and deep
   learning for analyzing the data and fetch useful information from the
   patterns and trends. In previous methodology only a regressive approach
   is used for calculation of slope. But in our approach, we have used
   sentimental analysis of products by setting up models in a productive
   way and had occupied accurate models for each Case in a life cycle of

Abstract = {Nevertheless to say that Energy consumption has a negative significant
   impact on the environment. In this context, the buildings sector
   accounts for around a percentage of 30\% of the world energy total
   consumption. Consequently, building designers should consider energy
   savings strategies in their designs to achieve a low level of energy
   consumption while maintaining their design goals. On the other hand,
   building energy performance assessments face difficult challenges. The
   main target of such paper is to evolve a newly easy-to-use integrated
   BIM-based framework to support decision making at the conceptual stage,
   which is considered the most critical phase of the design. This
   framework empowers designers to investigate more design options while
   achieving the high level of the energy performance. Utilizing the power
   of visual programming to set the key-parameters that have significant
   effects on the performance like building orientation and form, and with
   using the appropriate BIM tools to easily transfer the design from the
   conceptual phase to the schematic phase of the project. A case study was
   applied to showcase the implementation of this workflow. Designers with
   limited programming experience may use this workflow to perform a broad
   variety of design options analysis, take the conscious design decision
   and easily implement it with their BIM-based workflow which will
   effectively reduce the time of design, improve the collaboration between
   teams, cause a significant energy saving in the building, and inevitably
   reduce life-cycle cost of the building.},

Abstract = {Due to the high-fidelity mapping of the physical buildings and the
   intelligent performance shown in their lifecycle, digital twins (DTs)
   have gained increasing attention in the building sector. Although
   digital twins based on building information modeling (BIM) have become a
   hot research topic, existing works emphasize the digitization of
   building static and dynamic information and lack a unified consideration
   of the inherent physical mechanisms and interactive behaviors of
   buildings. To this end, this paper proposes a foundation model for
   building digital twins which realizes the unification of building static
   information, physical mechanisms and interaction patterns. The
   conceptual framework of the model is given first and then formal
   modeling and verification with time automata theory are performed to
   demonstrate the plausibility of the model. Finally, a practical digital
   twin of a chiller is developed based on the proposed foundation model as
   an example, thus, indicating its effectiveness and credibility.},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Amidst the backdrop of globalization and rapid technological
   advancements, the Chinese construction industry confronts an imperative
   need to evolve, addressing the inefficiencies and resource-intensive
   nature of its traditional housing construction model to meet the demands
   for sustainable, personalized, and technologically integrated living
   spaces. This paper underscores the pressing necessity for a
   transformative shift within the housing industry, advocating for the
   integration of advanced manufacturing principles and digital
   technologies to enhance construction efficiency and align with
   contemporary societal expectations. By employing a hybrid research
   methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with field measurements,
   the study assesses the impact of digitization on housing
   industrialization, revealing the potential for a smart construction
   industrial internet platform to act as the industry's central nervous
   system. The research concludes that the strategic adoption of this
   platform, powered by artificial intelligence and big data, can
   significantly streamline project management, leading to a more
   coordinated and efficient construction process. This work contributes to
   the discourse on industry transformation by providing actionable
   insights for stakeholders, charting a course for the sustainable and

Abstract = {The identification and leverage of the Building Information Model (BIM)
   technology are at the core of the successful digital transformation of
   the construction industry. However, due to its ability to integrate with
   various digital technologies and platforms, facilitating the digital and
   sustainable construction of the entire lifecycle of a building, BIM
   technology cannot be simply defined and operationalized with a single
   dimension of the construct. Based on the importance of multidimensional
   structures called for in the viewpoint of existing research and the
   resource-based view, we develop a second-order construct model to
   measure BIM technology capabilities. We define and operationalize the
   BIM technology capabilities, based on theory, as a reflective-reflective
   higher-order construct by developing and validating a 17-item scale that
   captures three first-order constructs. The measurement model results
   show strong reliability, dimensionality of the first-order measurement
   model, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. The
   multidimensional structure and instrument provide researchers with an
   opportunity to test the theories about the antecedents and outcomes of
   BIM technology capabilities, as well as the process and conditions.},

Abstract = {The European Union currently imports two third of its oil and gas which
   makes it the world's leading importer of these fuels. Due to increasing
   energy prices and relatively high percentage of building related energy
   consumption much effort is invested for energy efficient buildings.
   Current studies show that improved building energy monitoring and
   optimization systems can contribute to the reduction of building energy
   consumption by 15 to 40\%. This research addresses the need for
   integration concepts, holistic monitoring and analysis methodologies,
   life-cycle oriented decision support and scenario based control
   strategies through the seamless integration of ubiquitous sensing
   infrastructures, simulation tools, BIM tools, service oriented
   architectures and data warehouse technologies. This paper discusses a
   model driven approach integrating IT systems at design, construction and
   operation stages of buildings so that monitoring, analysis and
   optimization of building energy performance can be achieved. The first
   prototype of the developed system is applied in a residential building
   of Turkish Prime Ministry Housing Development Administration (HDA) in
   Istanbul, Turkey within the scope of DASSEB - Dynamic System
   Architecture for Energy Efficient Building Operations research project.},

Title = {Modelling the Stages of Pre-Project Preparation and Design Development

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {The stages of pre-project preparation and design development are the
   fundamentals to the further implementation of an investment and
   construction project. The success of construction and commissioning of
   facilities depends on the smooth completion of these stages. The
   duration of stages depends on the competence and coordination of
   interaction between participants of an investment and construction
   project, rational decision making by the project manager and a number of
   other factors. Identifying these factors and finding rational planning
   options in terms of the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development is a highly relevant task. With this in mind, the authors
   have developed an organizational and management model of a rational
   procedure to be implemented by the project manager at the stages of
   pre-project preparation and design development for a facility to be
   constructed. The model takes into account the influence of negative
   factors. The authors have also developed a method for selecting rational
   solutions at the stages in question. The analysis of the research
   literature and regulatory documents was performed for this purpose. The
   method of expert evaluations, elements of numerical analysis,
   mathematical processing of practical results and methods of mathematical
   modeling were applied. As a result, the authors have developed an
   organizational and management model for a rational combination of
   procedures at the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development for a facility to be constructed and derived a formula
   determining the duration of implementation of each stage and a technique
   designated for selecting rational solutions at the stages in question.
   The findings of this study can simplify project planning and process
   management at the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development in terms of information modeling.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},

Number = {C},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite decades of the digitization of the construction industry,
   interoperability challenges prevail. One of which is the lack of
   sufficient integration between domain-specific BIM models. Therefore,
   the paper proposes a novel methodology for federating cross-domain
   BIM-based knowledge graphs. The approach leverages the integration of
   multiple models into a single knowledge graph, aiming to bridge the
   existing gaps in data exchange and enhance the semantic richness of
   building information models. Through a detailed exploration of existing
   data exchange mechanisms, popular ontologies, and schema limitations,
   this research addresses the interoperability dilemma. A practical
   demonstration, encapsulated in the ``LBD-Online-Merge{''} demo
   application, validates the methodology's efficacy in real-world
   scenarios, illustrating its potential to revolutionize building
   operations management and data preparation for the operational phase of
   a building's lifecycle. This study significantly contributes to the
   academic and practical discourse by providing a robust framework for
   achieving a more integrated, intelligent building information management
   ecosystem, setting a new benchmark for future research and applications
   in constructing semantically rich digital twins of the built
   environment.},

Abstract = {Specific navigation systems are necessary to navigate in complex
   buildings and these should provide a realistic virtual indoor
   environment. A key issue is creation and management of building
   documentation. Map information is typically proprietary, sometimes
   recorded on heterogeneous media, and it is even volatile, such as
   layouts in a shopping mall, where change is continuous. In order to
   create a navigation system with a realistic indoor virtual environment,
   we propose a 2D and 3D indoor mapping approach, which is a key module of
   indoor services life cycle. Our approach is based on a 3D game engine,
   which 1) can build an effective 2D SVG map that updates selectively, 2)
   converts it into a 3D virtual scene automatically at back-end, 3)
   includes an information management system at back-end, 4) renders and
   interacts efficiently and effectively on a smart phone, and 5) provides
   a vivid virtual indoor visualization for users' navigation at frontend.
   Our solution of back-end includes 2D SVG indoor map management and 3D
   indoor model creation. Front-end includes indoor 3D modeling and
   navigation scene implementation in Unity3D. Such indoor mapping approach
   provides a solid foundation for further indoor management and navigation
   services.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is hailed as the driver for the economic
   development of every country to a great extent due to its dynamic
   nature, yet it needs digital transformation to align with the fast-paced
   digital world economy. Hence, to evaluate the potential for the digital
   transformation of various segments of the construction industry, a
   systematic review was conducted in this study. English research articles
   were extracted from the Scopus database by using keywords of ``Digital
   Transformation{''} AND ``Construction Industry{''} correlated to the
   engineering field. After a detailed screening process as per the PRISMA
   statement, only 26 articles were selected for further assessment from a
   total of 67 extracted articles. The extracted articles were focusing on
   digital technologies e.g., Building Information Modeling (BIM), Smart
   Devices, Internet of things (IoT), Drones, Project studio (PS), and
   digital twins and their implication in the digital transformation of the
   construction industry. It was evident that digital transformation
   enhanced the productivity and efficiency of construction projects with
   better control over cost, time, and risk throughout the project life
   cycle. Therefore, it is recommended to establish top management interest
   for digital partnering with trusted organizations enabling the
   realization of digital technologies in the construction industry.},

Abstract = {Hydrotechnical construction has always been considered a prestigious
   profession, which attracted the most talented students. The
   international practice of education also involves the allocation of
   transport maritime engineering from general and civil construction. The
   Institute of Water Transport in the structure of Admiral Makarov State
   University of Maritime and Inland Shipping considers the development of
   polytechnic education for the specialty of hydrotechnical construction
   as an urgent task for the future. Gradual transition to the system of
   polytechnic education is carried out by conducting laboratory practices
   and works in the field, where students independently participate in
   engineering surveys, studies of natural materials and soil, perform
   geodetic work. A new trend in development for hydraulic engineering
   construction is the use of building information modelling (BIM)
   technologies for the life cycle of structures. The introduction of BIM
   technologies should radically improve and interlink all the directions
   of design, construction and operation of such unique objects as water
   transport hydraulic structures. We give several examples of the
   introduction of polytechnic education in the system of training
   specialists of various levels (bachelor, master and specialist) for
   hydraulic engineering construction of water transport facilities, which
   corresponds to the best world practices. The results in the formation of
   new professional skills and competencies are based on the application of
   system analysis and a unified methodology for the synthesis of various
   construction disciplines that are logically related and focused on the
   solution of assigned tasks.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the knowledge system in Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) technology in Medical Construction Projects (MCPs).
   Specifically, it proposes knowledge graph analysis utilizing scient
   metric techniques and employs VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to
   analyze the consequence of relevant statistics from the literature
   concerning BIM medical construction projects (BIM-MCPs). In order to
   analyze the collaboration network, the analysis of the co-occurrence
   network, and the analysis of the co-citation network, 83 journal
   articles were gathered. The results obtained from the research indicate
   that (a) the intellectual framework of BIMMCPs can be categorized into
   four distinct clusters. (b) The research focus in BIM-MCPs has evolved,
   including model development, frameworks, implementation, system
   integration, application throughout the entire lifecycle, emergency
   medical engineering project applications, and intelligent management of
   medical facilities and smart buildings. (c) Prospective directions for
   research are delineated in three distinct areas: enhancement of use for
   BIM Medical Facility Management (BIM-MFM), integration of BIM technology
   in sustainability assessment, and application of BIM technology in
   emergency medical engineering and smart medical construction.},

Abstract = {A frequent and accurate quality inspection procedure to assess the
   quality requirements during the life cycle of buildings is crucial.
   Among different quality measures, the dimensional quality that involves
   spatial features of buildings is of significant importance. However, the
   traditional manual inspection of dimensional quality in buildings is
   unreliable and tedious. Thus, this study presents an end-to-end method
   for quality inspection of building structural members using point cloud
   datasets. The proposed method, first, detects and labels structural
   members within the point cloud based on a set of domain-specific
   geometric and semantic definitions. Then, each structural member's
   section width, height, and length are obtained with the proposed
   bounding box method. Experiments on three real-world buildings' point
   clouds with various geometric features and noise levels, oc-clusion, and
   outliers were also conducted, illustrating the performance efficiency
   and accuracy of the proposed model for dimensional quality inspection of
   building structural members.},

Abstract = {Albert Einstein is credited with saying, ``Insanity: doing the same

   ``Groundhog Day{''}. We challenge you to look at the process of design,
   delivery, and operations for our buildings. Are we all stuck in
   ``insanity{''} or ``Groundhog Day?{''} We keep doing things the same way
   and expecting different results. This article explores how the
   utilization of facility data from design to operations can not only
   break the paradigm of ``insanity,{''} it can make our facilities more
   efficient and sustainable to construct and operate. Our basic premise is
   that if you do not have accurate ``data{''} about your facility it will
   be very difficult, if not impossible, to operate your facility

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As building information modeling (BIM) technology becomes mature, there
   is an increasing demand for the interaction or interoperability between
   BIM tools and various facility management (FM) systems, especially in
   semiconductor fabrication plants (FABs). Customized BIM services, i.e.,
   plugin programs, have been developed for FM systems to reuse BIM data or
   functionality. However, such development may make an FM system more
   vulnerable to external changes such as BIM tool upgrades. The quality of
   BIM models reused may deteriorate sharply even if a slight change occurs
   in any of the upstream BIM services. Based on the model-driven
   architecture defined by Object Management Group, this research proposes
   a semi-automated FM system factory called EncapsulatingBIM4FM to
   formalize the reuse process of BIM services so that changes on BIM tools
   will not propagate to an FM system. A pilot system for selected FM tasks
   for an FAB in Taiwan was crafted using EncapsulatingBIM4FM. The tests
   demonstrated that BIM and FM systems can achieve software
   interoperability, and they can evolve independently based on individual
   requirements. BIM's central role in the management of a facility's
   lifecycle information could be established if EncapsulatingBIM4FM is
   utilized to develop associated FM systems for the facility.},

Abstract = {In this interactive lively lunch discussion, participants explored
   issues around how the traditional subject liaison role is evolving.
   Users increasingly require functional information support (e.g., for
   geographic information system (GIS) or data mining) rather than simply
   domain-specific. At the same time, reports from the Association of
   Research Libraries (ARL) Pilot Library Liaison Institute and others have
   noted self-conscious trends toward developing liaison roles that engage
   and support the full research life cycle, as opposed to traditional
   service models focused on building and promoting library collections as
   more or less fixed products. Hosts Darby Orcutt, Mira Waller, and Scott
   Warren outlined some the major theme surrounding the future of these new
   roles and with participants explored questions that include: What does
   it mean to be a collections librarian in this new world? What new skills
   do we need to develop? What old skills should we not lose? How do we
   adapt both our institutions and our individual staff without sacrificing
   our (or their) very identities?},

Abstract = {Requirements traceability provides important support throughout all
   software life cycle; however, creating such links manually is
   time-consuming and error-prone. Supervised automated solutions use
   machine learning or deep learning techniques to generate trace links,
   but require large labeled dataset to train an effective model.
   Unsupervised solutions as word embedding approaches can generate links
   by capturing the semantic meaning of artifacts and are gaining more
   attention. Despite that, our observation revealed that, besides the
   semantic information, the sequential information of terms in the
   artifacts would provide additional assistance for building the accurate
   links. This paper proposes an unsupervised requirements traceability
   approach (named S2Trace) which learns the Sequential Semantics of
   software artifacts to generate the trace links. Its core idea is to mine
   the sequential patterns and use them to learn the document embedding
   representation. Evaluation is conducted on five public datasets, and
   results show that our approach outperforms three typical baselines. The
   modeling of sequential information in this paper provides new insights
   into the unsupervised traceability solutions, and the improvement in the
   traceability accuracy further proves the usefulness of the sequential
   information.},

Abstract = {Advances in Information Communication Technology (ICT) have led to the
   development of more advanced computer management systems in the
   Australian construction industry, including Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). BIM is an ICT-enabled approach involving digital
   representations of building elements and information related to
   different phases of the building lifecycle, and is used to provide
   shared information and to form a reliable basis for decision making
   Pilot projects and research papers have verified many claims about BIM,
   and prove a viable economic case, yet uptake of the technology still
   remains low. A literature review revealed three key productivity gains
   experienced by BIM use on a construction project: accuracy,
   communication and time/performance. Four ICT barriers to its
   implementation were identified as interoperability, funding and resource
   cost, cultural barriers and perceived risk, and security and protection.
   Findings on research done on these barriers in Australia reveal that
   many companies see the benefits for BIM, but believe other disciplines
   and the client should implement the model. Construction professionals
   usually work within their field of expertise, with limited interaction
   with other disciplines, even though many issues on work sites require
   collaboration from multiple disciplines. A common medium of
   communication, provided by BIM systems, will achieve this integrated
   building approach. This paper finds that ICT barriers prevent the
   Australian construction industry from taking full advantage of potential
   productivity gains proven in BIM.},

Abstract = {The importance of Software Cost Estimation at the early stages of the
   development life cycle is clearly portrayed by the utilization of
   several models and methods, appeared so far in the literature. The
   researchers' interest has been focused on two well known techniques,
   namely the parametric Regression Analysis and the non-parametric
   Estimation by Analogy. Despite the several comparison studies, there
   seems to be a discrepancy in choosing the best prediction technique
   between them. In this paper, we introduce a semi-parametric technique,
   called LSEbA that achieves to combine the aforementioned methods
   retaining the advantages of both approaches. Furthermore, the proposed
   method is consistent with the mixed nature of Software Cost Estimation
   data and takes advantage of the whole pure information of the dataset
   even if there is a large amount of missing values. The paper
   analytically illustrates the process of building such a model and
   presents the experimentation on three representative datasets verifying
   the benefits of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, bias and
   spread. Comparisons of LSEbA with linear regression, estimation by
   analogy and a combination of them, based on the average of their
   outcomes are made through accuracy metrics, statistical tests and a
   graphical tool, the Regression Error Characteristic curves.},

Title = {From sketch BIM to design BIM: An element identification approach using
   Industry Foundation Classes and object recognition},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {188},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a promising technology for
   building lifecycle management. Currently, BIM has been extensively used
   in both the sketch design (sketch) and detailed design (design) stages.
   Due to different purposes and different BIM tools, the reusability of
   sketch BIM models in the design stage is still challenging. To address
   this issue, this study proposes a building element identification scheme
   using a segmentation-aggregation strategy, termed EI-SA. Since Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) is the international standard of BIM, the EI-SA
   is built according to the IFC specification. Firstly, the element
   identification Problem is formally defined, followed by the overall
   framework of the EI-SA. Then, a presentation-level BIM segmentation
   algorithm is developed to divide a sketch BIM model into slices of
   geometric representations. Thirdly, a representation aggregation scheme
   is proposed to solve the element identification problem. The
   representation aggregation scheme employs a triangle-triangle
   intersection to detect the geometric connection and an object
   recognition algorithm to identify elements. Finally, experiments were
   conducted on several sketch BIM models. The experiment results showed
   that the EI-SA identified 82.22\% elements on average, which verified
   the effectiveness of the EI-SA. To the best of our knowledge, this study
   is the first to solve the building element identification problem
   according to IFC. The proposed EI-SA will bridge the gap between sketch
   BIM models and design BIM models, smooth the reusability of data from
   the sketch stage to downstream stages, and improve the design efficiency
   by avoiding the re-designing of building elements.},

Title = {Increasing the competitiveness of wood in material substitution: A
   method for assessing and prioritizing customer needs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {154-162},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {To increase the competitiveness of wood as a building material requires
   knowledge of which customer needs require attention in terms of quality
   improvement and/or product development to best satisfy customers. Hence,
   information as to the impact on customer satisfaction of the fulfillment
   of different customer needs, as well as the performance of wood and
   substitutes in providing for these needs, is needed. This article
   suggests the use of customer satisfaction modeling (CSM) for assessing
   customer needs. The methodology is evaluated in the context of
   floorcovering. The results suggest that CSM is well suited for
   extracting the information necessary for prioritizing customer needs:
   importance/impact and performance data for attributes as well as for
   customer benefits. The study indicates the necessity of considering
   substitute materials not only for performance comparisons; substitutes
   may also reveal otherwise latent customer needs. Practical, functional,
   benefits exert the greatest impact on customer satisfaction for wooden
   flooring as well as its closest substitutes, laminate and carpet.
   Hygiene and a low cost over the life cycle are apparently the customer
   benefits that require attention from wooden flooring manufacturers,
   because importance is high and performance relatively low.},

Abstract = {Change iterations in construction create uncertainties and make the
   project management dynamic and unstable. Published literature shows that
   30\% of the construction cost is attributed to rework. Moreover, change
   orders are considered as the largest source of construction waste.
   Construction professionals have to make change decisions based on their
   previous experience and assumptions supported by incomplete information.
   Objective methods based on state-of-the-art technology can be
   systematically used to address the above challenge. Despite its promise,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) based dynamic modeling has not been
   researched to estimate waste generation from change orders. In this
   paper, Building Information Modeling (BIM) was used to simulate the
   field data over the project lifecycle to analyze the ripple effects of
   construction changes. A system dynamic model was developed to map
   interactions in the system. Virtual BIM data was used to analyze the
   dynamic behavior of the variables due to the changes in the scope of
   work. Case study results showed that the client's commitment to decrease
   waste in the pre-project planning stage, with coordinated BIM design
   efforts, could reduce construction waste by up to 25\%.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A consistent and easily recognizable name is the primary identifier of
   an object in building information modeling ( BIM). Existing naming
   conventions vary significantly and require extensive manual work that is
   often tedious and error-prone. This study ( 1) develops a standardized
   naming convention for BIM objects and ( 2) devises a semiautomatic
   naming approach for saving manual work. In the proposed naming
   convention, each segment is included by referencing BIM standards with a
   consideration of BIM users' actual needs, and the semiautomatic approach
   is formalized for both completed and ongoing BIM models. Validated by a
   control experiment and feedback from the project manager and BIM
   engineers of a real-life project, this research can be immediately
   applied to realize standardized BIM object names. This study also
   generates practical implications for BIM-based project management, where
   standardized BIM object names are required for supporting object
   identification and information incorporation throughout a project

Abstract = {Construction industry faces many challenges as socio-economical needs
   evolve and Building Information Modeling (BIM) disrupts practices. BIM
   processes and solutions are mainly suited for the design stage of a
   project and experts are currentlyworking to bridge the gap with the
   construction stage. Improving on BIM practices could be done by creating
   a more industrialized way of handling construction operations by
   learning from other industrial fields. This could help to manage
   quality, delay, and cost more precisely, while considering new
   indicators (e.g.: GHG emissions). BIM could be improved by developing a
   construction stage specific data structure inspired by Product Lifecycle
   Management (PLM) systems. This requires to dynamically manage data for
   different stakeholders before and during the operations. This paper
   presents a conceptual data framework to develop a BIM-based decision
   support system to plan and manage construction operations. A 4D digital
   mock-up is gradually enriched to support construction processes studies
   resulting in a As Planned view of the building. Process engineering work
   is carried through iterative loops and supported by knowledge-based
   indicators. A cross-disciplinary workflow allows the use of new
   production methods (e.g.: off-site modular construction). An As Built
   view of the mock-up is concurrently created as operations advance and
   changes occur, feeding back the knowledge-based indicators.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a metric for expressing the entropy of a software
   system and for assessing the quality of its organization from the
   perspective of impact analysis. The metric is called `'structural
   information'' and is based on a model dependency descriptor. The metric
   is characterized by its independence from the method of building the
   system and the architectural styles which represent it at the various
   levels of abstraction. It takes into account both the structure of the
   components at all levels of abstraction and the structure derived from
   the links between the different levels of abstraction. The use of this
   metric makes if possible to monitor changes in the quality levels of the
   system during its life-cycle and to determine which level of
   documentation is causing the degradation of the system. This enables
   adopting timely measures to counter any drop in the quality of a system
   due to poorly performed maintenance. In addition, the metric can serve
   to check that perfective maintenance objectives are attained.},

Abstract = {Estimates of the environmental impacts of constructing and operating
   buildings are critical for improving the sustainability of construction.
   To identify the best design, a holistic approach is necessary,
   considering emissions, energy use, direct costs, potential earthquake
   costs, etc. Accordingly, this paper addresses a multitude of lifecycle
   impacts associated with the manufacturing, construction, operations,
   damage, and demolition of buildings. All impacts are translated into a
   common utility, measured in dollars. A collection of cost models is
   developed, and detailed building models are created from BIM, i.e.,
   building information modelling. A comprehensive analysis is conducted
   for a six-story building. Results show that the steel material option
   results in the lowest construction cost. The wood option results in the
   lowest cost of emissions, while the concrete option contributes the most
   to climate change. Earthquake damage accounts for about 3\% of the total
   expected cost, but the worst-case earthquake cost exceeds the building
   value.},

Abstract = {Incorporating information systems and information technology (IS/IT) is
   badly needed in extended enterprises. For this purpose, the enterprise
   engineering approach offers important benefits; however there is no
   complete framework to define and model IS/IT components and their
   strategic alignment with the business strategy. This paper presents an
   enterprise architecture framework for extended enterprises which
   improves not only the strategic alignment process inside each individual
   company, but also the strategic alignment process for the extended
   enterprise. The main aim of this paper is to provide a modelling
   framework from the enterprise engineering approach which includes the
   components to model the IS/IT strategy and allow the extended enterprise
   to improve strategic alignment process. A comparative analysis has been
   done of life- cycle phases, modelling views and the strategic alignment
   between different enterprise architectures. Next, the required building
   blocks have been proposed: IS/IT conceptualization, strategic
   dependencies, alignment heuristics, maturity model and application
   portfolio (as-is and to-be). This proposal has been applied in the
   collaborative order management process of a ceramic tile company with
   its suppliers and consumers.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal model to quantify stocks of building structural products
   for a prospective circular economy},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The building construction sector consumes significant quantities of
   resources, generates high levels of waste and creates many negative
   environmental impacts including carbon emissions. These problems are
   characteristic of linear value chains. In contrast, a circular economy
   approach to building construction has the potential to moderate these
   three problems. One way this can be achieved is to enable in-use
   building stocks as a repository of products for future reuse, sometimes
   referred to as urban mining. A key stage in such a shift is to be able
   to quantify stocks of construction materials and assess their direct
   reuse potential as products against criteria such as their location,
   age, type, and embodied carbon. The majority of studies of building
   stocks have focused on producing aggregated quantities of materials,
   regardless of the required information for assessing the potential value
   streams of future reuse. In this paper, a framework for spatiotemporal
   mapping of building structural products integrating external geometries
   and construction history is presented. To demonstrate its capacity, the
   stocks of clay bricks within the external walls of buildings are
   assessed where six types of buildings and four types of bricks are
   specified. Dimensions, weights, ages and embodied carbon of materials
   are estimated for case studies of three urban regions in Northern
   England: Manchester, Leeds and Bradford, and the results are spatially
   mapped for the city of Bradford. The paper provides the first systematic
   and comprehensive area-wide model to evaluate stocks of building
   structural products for future urban mining and circular economy of
   building construction systems.},

Abstract = {To achieve a green transition in construction, all parts of the building
   lifecycle should be examined for potential emission reductions.
   Historically, much effort has been placed on operational energy of
   facilities. Recently, the focus has been supplemented with an embodied
   energy focus, looking at the production of materials and the circular
   economy aspect of reuse and recycling. However, the construction process
   itself has, until now, attained little focus in the green transition. At
   the same time, construction is inefficient and wasteful, as research
   shows that only 33\% of working time is value-adding, resulting in
   longer construction duration. Longer duration requires more operation of
   machines, transportation, and daily running of construction sites. These
   non-value-adding operations require energy and emit unnecessary
   emissions. Consequently, today's tacit acceptance of time and cost
   overruns is effectively the same as an industry's acceptance of
   unnecessarily large emissions. To reduce construction emissions from
   equipment-related operations, a closer to real-time monitoring of
   construction equipment's efficiency and their emissions is needed. This
   research's vision aims to minimize emissions by optimizing the site
   layout and improving planning, hence reducing construction machine
   working hours. Our method incorporates real-time sensory data (mainly
   position, NOx, and particle emissions from internal combustion engines)
   and information modeling to achieve this novel agenda. This paper
   presents a small-scale sensor technology called SEMS (Simplified
   Emissions Measurement System) capable of rapidly measuring such emission
   data. Preliminary findings from experimental testing identify potentials
   and future methodological considerations how such data can be applied in
   information management and decision making.},

Title = {Digital building twins and blockchain for performance-based (smart)

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {133},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Servitization business models can use performance-based contracts to
   consider overall life-cycle costs rather than just production costs.
   However, practical implementation of performance contracts has been
   limited due to challenges with performance evaluation, accountability,
   and financial concepts. As a solution, this paper proposes the
   connection of the digital building twin with blockchain-based smart
   contracts to execute performancebased digital payments. First, we
   conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital
   building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates
   performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and
   trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards
   through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both
   the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum
   blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens
   building twin platform. The resulting prototype is the first full-stack
   implementation of a performance-based smart contract in the built
   environment.},

Abstract = {The most significant recent development in the AEC industry has been the
   adoption of Building Information Modelling ( BIM), but its full
   potential is far from being fully exploited. The Internet of Things (
   IoT) provides a rich source of new data for BIM. BIM can provide a
   framework for the organization and analysis of IoT data. Each IoT
   solution can require thousands of sensors creating a continuous stream
   of varied data.
   A connection between BIM and the IoT throughout the lifecycle would
   result in many new possibilities. This paper examines emulating or
   simulating large numbers of IoT devices to explore the potential of
   effectively linking BIM with the IoT.
   With emulation, the complete outwardly observable behavior of real
   historical IoT devices is mimicked and matched. The alternative to
   emulation is simulation where an abstract model of the IoT network is
   created programmatically using rules.
   Emulating and simulating devices reduces the barriers to carrying out
   the development required to enable BIM to utilize the full potential of
   the IoT.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of carbon impacts during building design has for too long
   unilaterally focused on the operational carbon impacts through the
   application of Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs), e.g. enhancing the
   thermal resistance of the building envelope by using additional
   insulations, Window to Wall Ratio (WWR) etc. Research indicates that
   there is a need to also include the embodied carbon impacts and
   optimizing the trade-off between embodied and operational carbon
   impacts. Multi-objective optimization approaches can be a solution for
   handling this trade-off. Therefore, a previously developed BIM-based
   multi-objective optimization approach has been extended to also cover
   the impact of the carbon footprint. The extended optimization approach
   was then tested in a case study of a multifamily residential building
   located in Stockholm to find the optimal design solutions of the
   embodied versus operational carbon impact trade-off. The results of the
   case study demonstrate the applicability of the extended approach in
   handling the trade-off problem and aiding in more environmentally
   friendly decisions during the design process.},

Abstract = {More than thirty years after the definition of sustainable development,
   the commitment to protect the planet has been renewed, and all sectors
   of human activity have been called to contribute to this critical
   challenge of our time. Therefore, the construction sector can also make
   an essential contribution. Designers are called upon to modify their
   actions to consider the environmental, social, and economic impacts
   during the entire life cycle of construction. The digital revolution
   could be a suitable opportunity for a profound renewal oriented towards
   sustainability. The new digital technologies and the increased computing
   power are useful for managing the increasing complexity in current
   projects and supporting collaboration between the many experts involved.
   The presented research analyzes the current state and identifies the
   signs of change and the cues to imagine possible virtuous complicity
   between sustainable development goals and the digital revolution's
   potential, which is supported by the operational features of
   optimization methods. Based on this in-depth analysis, an operational
   strategy has been defined, combining the three macro themes usually
   treated separately-sustainability, digitization, and optimization. This
   strategy can be a valuable tool to guide designers in optimizing the
   process of sustainable design and regenerative construction.},

Abstract = {Roads are networks that connect social infrastructure and accommodate
   the delivery of emergency services. Because of the importance of roads,
   they should be safe and kept in good condition. To perform effective
   road management, the use of spatial and temporal information is
   necessary. Maintenance management is an essential operation that should
   be carried out effectively for maintaining, repairing, and
   rehabilitating roads. It is necessary to accumulate information produced
   during the entire life cycle of a road in order to analyze problems and
   find solutions within a temporal sequence and to maintain roads
   strategically and effectively. In this paper, four-dimensional
   information is defined as the combination of three-dimensional spatial
   information and temporal information. Four-dimensional information is
   required for storing the historical information of road condition. This
   paper proposes a four-dimensional information management system to
   collect, accumulate, share, and utilize four-dimensional information.
   The system consists of a spatial data infrastructure, road data models,
   a model library, a common system interface, common functions, a road
   database, and a road application system. The road application system
   provides functions for simulation, progress management, and the
   representation of four-dimensional information. The system is
   demonstrated using actual data on road maintenance. It is verified that
   the system has the capability to be applied in practice. (C) 2013

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Volume = {53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The car sharing is an effective supplement to public transportation
   systems. However, how to select an appropriate site for building a car
   sharing station is a big challenge. Therefore, in this paper, a novel
   picture fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is proposed to
   solve the site selection problem for car sharing stations. To this end,
   the definition of picture fuzzy sets is adopted to accurately portray
   the voting information. Then, a concept of knowledge measure is defined
   for PFNs and an objective method based on knowledge measure is proposed
   to derive the weight information of criteria. To rank the candidate
   sites for car sharing stations, an extended MULTIMOORA method based on
   novel score function and Borda rule is devised. The proposed MCDM model
   is applied to solve the site selection for car sharing stations in
   Bejing. Finally, comparative analyses are given to verify the
   superiority of the proposed MCDM model.},

Title = {Key factors affecting the decision-making process for buildings projects
   in Egypt},
Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The success of optimal system selection depends on many factors, such as
   the nature of the project itself, design team collaboration, team
   leader's personality, and client input. Unfortunately, despite numerous
   existing studies on key impacting factors in various fields of
   construction design, the majority of them failed to focus on the key
   factors affecting the structure design decision-making process. This
   study aims to identify, investigate, and rank factors perceived to
   affect decision-making for the optimal system in the construction
   industry, particularly that of buildings, during the early stages of the
   entire life cycle, in terms of their relative importance. Practitioners
   and experts from Egypt comprising a statistically representative sample,
   were invited to participate in a structured questionnaire survey to
   achieve this objective. The questionnaire was composed of 17 factors
   classified under three primary stage categories: feasibility study,
   planning, and design and engineering. The relative importance index and
   dispersion analysis were used to obtain statistics and calculate the
   collected data. The results show that ``The impact of financial
   difficulties on the decision-making{''} is the first key factor, ``The
   impact of errors and omissions due to the lack of communication and
   coordination on the decision-making{''} is the second key factor, and
   ``The Impact of inaccurate evaluation of projects duration on the
   decision-making{''} and ``The impact of design changes upon contractor
   request on the decision-making?{''} constitute the third key factors.
   Therefore, this work can guide decision-makers for effective
   construction management and help achieve a competitive quality and
   cost-effective project.(c) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Title = {Semiautomated Railway Line Information Modeling Based on Asset
   Management Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) period is a critical and
   resource-intensive phase of the life cycle of railway line
   infrastructure. The O\&M of a railway line during this period requires a
   large amount of investment and labor. Thus, there is an urgent need for
   railway managers to seek more efficient management tools and methods to
   improve management efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
   Infrastructure-building information model (I-BIM) technology,
   characterized by its intuitive representation and high
   information-integration capabilities, has gained considerable traction
   with infrastructure industry researchers. In the context of existing
   railway lines, the absence of corresponding I-BIMs or similar technology
   owing to the immaturity of technical development at the time led to the
   use of manual modeling processes, which have limitations such as high
   cost, slow speed, and low efficiency. This paper presents an innovative,
   high-speed, semiautomated method for generating I-BIMs for existing
   railway lines and leveraging asset management data without incurring
   additional data collection costs. This approach leverages key modules
   such as line trajectory computation, element model generation, the
   linking of O\&M semantic information, and the visualization of asset
   health indexes, which can enable the swift and semiautomated creation of
   an O\&M-oriented I-BIM for railway lines. This process elevates
   traditional two-dimensional database tables into more intuitive,
   operation-oriented, and semantically rich models. This results in the
   provision of more efficient support for maintenance management decisions
   related to railway lines. The proposed method addresses the limitations
   of manual modeling processes and can pave the way for enhanced O\&M
   efficiency in the railway infrastructure sector.
   The absence of BIMs during the design and construction phase of existing
   railway lines, coupled with the high costs and error rates associated
   with manual modeling, constitute substantial barriers to the
   implementation of BIMs in operation and management. By leveraging the
   proposed semiautomated modeling approach, which relies on management
   data, site managers and researchers can rapidly establish basic I-BIMs.
   Although the asset ledgers and station equipment plans used in this
   approach originate from National Railway Administration, similar data
   sets should serve as fundamental inputs for railway line operation and
   maintenance worldwide. By deploying this method, field managers can
   enhance traditional two-dimensional (2D) asset ledgers into a
   three-dimensional (3D) I-BIM, thereby offering a more intuitive
   understanding of the assets within their jurisdiction. Owing to the
   integration of geographic information system maps into the model,
   personnel can directly query asset-related geographic information,
   potentially reducing the frequency and cost of off-site surveys. For
   researchers, using this method to establish a real-world model rapidly
   offers convenient access for further BIM-based applications, such as the
   integration of real-time data from on-site sensors to formulate digital
   twins.},

Abstract = {Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase is the main contributor to the
   total lifecycle cost of a building. Previous studies have described that
   Building Information Models (BIM), if available with detailed asset
   information and their properties, can enable rapid troubleshooting and
   execution of O\&M tasks by providing the required information of the
   facility. Despite the potential benefits, there is still rarely BIM with
   Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) assets and properties that are
   available for O\&M. BIM is usually not in possession for existing
   buildings and generating BIM manually is a time-consuming process.
   Hence, there is a need for an automated approach that can reconstruct
   the MEP systems in BIM. Previous studies investigated automatic
   reconstruction of BIM using architectural drawings, structural drawings,
   or the combination with photos. But most of the previous studies are
   limited to reconstruct the architectural and structural components. Note
   that mechanical components in the building typically require more
   frequent maintenance than architectural or structural components.
   However, the building mechanical drawings are relatively more complex
   due to various type of symbols that are used to represent the mechanical
   systems. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposed a
   symbol recognition framework that can automatically recognize the
   different type of symbols in the building mechanical drawings. This
   study applied vector-based computer vision techniques to recognize the
   symbols and their properties (e.g., location, type, etc.) in two
   vector-based input documents: 2D drawings and the symbol description
   document. The framework not only enables recognizing and locating the
   mechanical component of interest for BIM reconstruction purpose but
   opens the possibility of merging the updated information into the
   current BIM in the future reducing the time of repeated manual creation
   of BIM after every renovation project.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the monitoring effect of building indoor
   environment, this paper carries out indoor environment simulation
   through 3D modeling, uses image processing technology to collect
   environmental monitoring data, and proposes a routing algorithm applied
   in this environment. Moreover, this paper introduces the energy
   consumption model of sensor nodes and the multi-attribute
   decision-making method and uses the multi-attribute decision-making to
   propose an adaptive energy balance routing algorithm based on the indoor
   environment of the building. In addition, this paper establishes a
   simulation analysis, compares it with several other routing algorithms,
   and verifies that the proposed algorithm has better balance in network
   energy consumption and longer network life cycle. Finally, this paper
   combines three-dimensional modeling and image processing technology to
   construct the building indoor environment monitoring system. It can be
   seen from the simulation experiments that the proposed building indoor
   environment monitoring system based on 3D modeling and image processing
   can meet the actual needs of intelligent building indoor monitoring.},

Abstract = {India is taking steps to decarbonize its economy and set a target of
   building 450 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Project
   finance has a critical role to play in enabling this transition to a
   carbon-resilient economy. The opportunity has attracted diversified
   institutional investors but has not resulted in a lower project cost of
   capital. To address this problem, this article presents a qualitative
   risk assessment model. The results show that risk drivers such as high
   debt-to-equity ratios (D/Es), technology disruptions, and inherent
   information asymmetry in the contractual bundles that plagued thermal
   power financing still remain unaddressed. Rethinking how project finance
   is applied is thus necessary. The author provides three suggestions:
   D/Es need to be optimized by sculpting them against cash flows; projects
   need the discipline of global capital markets and institutions over
   their life cycle; and financial institutions need to actively
   incorporate climate risk into their internal rating models to price
   credit risk.},

Abstract = {Performance engineering focuses on the quantitative investigation of the
   behavior of a system during the early phase of the system development
   life cycle. Bearing this on mind, we delineate a performance modeling
   framework of the application for communication system that proposes a
   translation process from high level UML notation to Continuous Time
   Markov Chain model (CTMC) and solves the model for relevant performance
   metrics. The framework utilizes UML collaborations, activity diagrams
   and deployment diagrams to be used for generating performance model for
   a communication system. The system dynamics will be captured by UML
   collaboration and activity diagram as reusable specification building
   blocks, while deployment diagram highlights the components of the
   system. The collaboration and activity show how reusable building blocks
   in the form of collaboration can compose together the service components
   through input and output pin by highlighting the behavior of the
   components and later a mapping between collaboration and system
   component identified by deployment diagram will be delineated. Moreover
   the UML models are annotated to associate performance related quality of
   service (QoS) information which is necessary for solving the performance
   model for relevant performance metrics through our proposed framework.
   The applicability of our proposed performance modeling framework in
   performance evaluation is delineated in the context of modeling a
   communication system.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been considered as a solution in
   construction industry to numerous problems such as delays, increased
   lead in times and increased costs. This is due to the concept and
   characteristic of BIM that will reshaped the way construction project
   teams work together to increase productivity and improve the final
   project outcomes (cost, time, quality, safety, functionality,
   maintainability, etc.). As a result, the construction industry has
   witnesses numerous of BIM software available in market. Each of this
   software has offers different function, features. Furthermore, the
   adoption of BIM required high investment on software, hardware and also
   training expenses. Thus, there is indentified that there is a need of
   decision aid for appropriated BIM software selection that fulfill the
   project needs. However, research indicates that there is limited study
   attempt to guide decision in BIM software selection problem. Thus, this
   paper highlight the importance of decision making and support for BIM
   software selection as it is vital to increase productivity, construction

Abstract = {The Master Plans (MP) used for Architectural Cultural Heritage
   conservation require specific standards for the documentation process.
   They must facilitate the achievement of the intended objectives about
   the knowledge acquisition and conservation of the building assets

   of an MP, once the heritage building is under use, tends to become
   dispersed and the documentation generated during the building use is
   rarely introduced in the MP. Therefore, this contribution has the
   following objectives: 1) study of the requirements of MP deliverables;
   2) study of the maturation requirements of the documentation processes
   and deliverables that are generated when applying the Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) methodology to an MP; 3) investigate if the
   application of the BIM strategies are suitable to respond to the needs
   of an MP in such a way that knowledge and conservation of heritage
   buildings are achieved; 4) verify that the exchange of information and
   the collaborative work among the different disciplines that generate

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Scientific visualization has been an essential process in the
   engineering field, enabling the tracking of large-scale simulation data
   and providing intuitive and comprehendible graphs and models that
   display useful data. For computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data, the
   need for scientific visualization is even more important given the
   complicated spatial data structure and large quantities of data points
   characteristic of CFD data. To better take advantage of CFD results for
   buildings, the potential use of virtual reality (VR) techniques cannot
   be overlooked in the development of building projects. However, the
   workflow required to bring CFD simulation results to VR has not been
   streamlined. Building information modeling (BIM) as a lifecycle tool for
   buildings includes as much information as possible for further
   applications. To this end, this study brings CFD visualization to VR
   using BIM tools and reports the evaluation and analysis of the results.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is considered as a vital technology
   to achieve building sustain ability in China. Many local companies have
   developed BIM assisting tools to accelerate the transformation of the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) industry. The industry
   believed the use of BIM tools would increase the informatization.
   However, no investigations have been made to evaluate the status of the
   tools providing BIM service in China. This study reviewed the typical
   features of BIM tools in China and illustrated the workflows of some
   representative tools. The common tools were counted. The different
   building projects where the tools were used and common functions of
   these tools were summarized. An assessment of their performances based
   on eleven criteria was conducted after the illustrations. The review of
   the tools finds that BIM software can be classified into three types,
   integrated platforms, instant service services, and supplementary works
   based on the workflow illustrations. The collaboration of these three
   types would contribute to cleaner production. The assessment revealed
   that the aspects where these tools played a role in improving
   engineering efficiency and what areas were needed to be improved. Three
   suggestions and three potential schemes of BIM tools in construction
   projects are discussed at the end. Developers need to further explore
   the cloud data usages, and thus, collaborations of different tools can
   be promoted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The continuous safety and performance of infrastructure structures is of
   particular importance for a modern society. The rail network becomes
   increasingly relevant in the context of the energy transition. Demands
   for resource efficiency in the construction sector will require
   significantly longer service lives for structures in the future. New
   digital maintenance strategies can make this goal achievable while
   reducing maintenance expenditures at the same time. This report focuses
   on new image-based methods for condition assessment and digital
   modelling of the geometry of structures as well as damage
   characteristics. In particular, the permanent storage of highly accurate
   damage position and extent information allows the tracking of damage
   propagation as a basis for novel predictive maintenance strategies.
   Using the example of railway bridges, it is shown how high-quality
   digital condition documentation is possible with the concept of digital
   twins. Photogrammetry is used to generate highly accurate geo-referenced
   3D building models from image data acquired by drones, for example, and
   AI processes are used to perform automated damage detection. The linking
   in a digital twin enables analyses and high-quality documentation over
   the life cycle and should start with an initialization measurement on
   new structures.},

Abstract = {Prediction of machine tool failure has been very important in modern
   metal cutting operations in order to meet the growing demand for product
   quality and cost reduction. This paper presents the study of building a
   neural network model for predicting the behavior of a boring process
   during its full life cycle. This prediction is achieved by the fusion of
   the predictions of three principal components extracted as features from
   the joint time-frequency distributions of energy of the spindle loads
   observed during the boring process. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty
   is assessed using nonlinear regression in order to quantify the errors
   associated with the prediction. The results show that the implemented
   Elman recurrent neural network is a viable method for the prediction of
   the feature behavior of the boring process, and that the constructed
   confidence bounds provide information crucial for subsequent maintenance
   decision making based on the predicted cutting tool degradation.},

Abstract = {Since cash flow of asset in the long run is generally subject to
   economic fluctuation, and also to potential damage due to seismic hazard
   risk, asset pricing is more relevantly evaluated, provided that
   uncertainties of both cash flow and seismic risk are properly taken into
   account. This study will propose a discounted cash flow method to
   evaluate asset pricing, in which incomes gained from asset are modeled
   as a Markov process and seismic loss is modeled due to only one
   earthquake event during the service time. A numerical example is
   demonstrated for an 11 story steel reinforced commercial building
   considering the service time of 50 years. Various risk-asset price
   curves are numerically obtained in the form of probability of excess
   versus asset price with discount rate as a parameter for cases with and
   without earthquake loss taken into account, and for a case in which
   earthquake strengthening measure is implemented. These curves contribute
   information to decision makers in charge of risk and investment

   BEM tools; (2) Illustrate the application of the three BEM tools; (3)
   Re-evaluate the three BEM tools; and (4) Develop guidelines for
   evaluation, selection and application of BEM tools in the design,

   tools were initially evaluated using four criteria: interoperability,
   usability, available inputs, and available outputs. Each of the top
   three BEM tools selected based on this initial evaluation was used in a
   case study to simulate and evaluate energy usage, daylighting

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has widely become an effective tool
   in engineering and construction fields. It could be used in: generating

   Information Modeling (BrIM). Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) is an
   intelligent representation of bridges since it contains all information
   needed about bridges through their whole lifecycle. This paper presents
   the use of Building Information Modeling in cost and time management of
   infrastructure bridges. BIM-based cost estimation application is
   presented which is capable to carry out approximate cost estimate; and
   detailed cost estimate. The application is designed in a flexible manner
   to be used with default values, or user defined values. Different
   performance measurement indexes are used in order to control the cost
   and schedule during execution phase of construction projects. This
   application integrates BIM with Earned Value (EV) concept to determine
   the project status at specific reporting date. A case study is presented

   assimilate key information and provide a framework for future research.
   An observational method of reviewing a series of data transactions

Title = {Advancing Urban Building Energy Modeling: Building Energy Simulations
   for Three Commercial Building Stocks through Archetype Development},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Urban building energy models (UBEMs), developed to understand the energy
   performance of building stocks of a region, can aid in key decisions
   related to energy policy and climate change solutions. However, creating
   a city-scale UBEM is challenging due to the requirements of diverse
   geometric and non-geometric datasets. Thus, we aimed to further
   elucidate the process of creating a UBEM with disparate and scarce data
   based on a bottom-up, physics-based approach. We focused on three
   typically overlooked but functionally important commercial building
   stocks, which are sales and shopping, healthcare facilities, and food
   sales and services, in the region of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We
   harvested relevant local building information and employed
   photogrammetry and image processing. We created archetypes for key
   building types, designed 3D buildings with SketchUp, and performed an
   energy analysis using EnergyPlus. The average annual simulated energy
   use intensities (EUIs) were 528 kWh/m2, 822 kWh/m2, and 2894 kWh/m2 for
   sales and shopping, healthcare facilities, and food sales and services,
   respectively. In addition to variations found in the simulated energy
   use pattern among the stocks, considerable variations were observed
   within buildings of the same stock. About 9\% and 11\% errors were
   observed for sales and shopping and healthcare facilities when
   validating the simulated results with the actual data. The suggested
   energy conservation measures could reduce the annual EUI by 10-26\%
   depending on the building use type. The UBEM results can assist in
   finding energy-efficient retrofit solutions with respect to the energy
   and carbon reduction goal for commercial building stocks at the city
   scale. The limitations highlighted may be considered for higher
   accuracy, and the UBEM has a high potential to integrate with urban
   climate and energy models, circular economy, and life cycle assessment
   for sustainable urban planning.},

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {198},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Construction materials embedded in existing buildings have unrealized
   recovery potential. To help realize this potential, governments have
   implemented policies such as replacing demolition with deconstruction,
   banning landfilling, and carbon reduction to either force or incentivize
   resource recovery and circularity. However, the efficacy of these
   policies has yet to be fully investigated. A novel methodology that
   quantitatively estimates the potential relative efficacy of such
   policies is proposed here. At its center is an optimization-based tool
   recognizing demolition and deconstruction activity precedence
   relationships that yields the optimal component end-of-life options,
   extended to include policy levers. Variations of four policy categories
   were chosen and applied to five building case studies. The results
   suggest that policy tools can help enforce near-optimal waste reductions
   and carbon savings that do not necessarily increase net project costs
   compared to traditional approaches. The effectiveness of these policies
   varies based on waste and carbon savings measures and building types.},

   design},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) provides significant opportunities to
   support useful services and functionalities for end users in buildings,
   enabling socalled smart spaces (e.g. smart buildings and smart homes).
   Current approaches perform this integration to access the deployed IoT
   devices once the building is constructed using Building Automation
   Systems (BAS), Building Information Systems (BIS) and Building Control
   Systems (BCS). Thus, the integration of IoT devices into the early
   stages of building design to describe IoT scenarios and IoT practices is
   still neglected, despite the benefits it can provide by being involved
   in the entire building lifecycle, e.g. cost estimation, stronger
   facility management, collaborative approach, simplification of tasks for
   developers/programmers through the integration with BIS, BAS and BCS,
   and a more holistic management of the IoT infrastructure.
   This paper presents a solution to integrate IoT into the design stage
   (modelling) of buildings in BIM processes, through two main
   contributions: Industry Foundation Classes Plus (IFC+), an extension to
   the latest version of IFC where new types of entities have been added to
   support the modelling of IoT scenarios; and a digital object based
   approach to transform smart-built environment specifications in IFC+
   into consumable software, with the aim of supporting IoT scenarios. This
   paper illustrates the applicability of the proposed method in the
   context of design processes, the metamodel (schema) of IFC+, the
   proposed approach, and a proof of concept with a clarifying use case.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling represents digitalization activities in
   building technology, whereas Industry 4.0 is used as a synonym for
   digital transformation in German industrial sectors. Both concepts use
   standardized properties to describe assets over their lifecycle.
   However, the exchange between these concepts is poor and activities are
   not synchronised. In consequence, manufacturers and users of asset
   information face high expenditures for the engineering of information
   via different interfaces. First outcomes of a research project show that
   information models of I4.0 are suitable to describe assets in building
   technology and can be integrated in BIM solutions. The paper examines
   synergies and possible combinations of the two concepts.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the main non-technical factors that influence social
   and market acceptance of solar photovoltaic panels and heat pumps in
   buildings. The paper discusses results from a literature review and a
   survey of European stakeholders. Statistical analysis results of survey
   data identify the most common barriers to adoption of renewables as:
   limited information about the technology, financial concerns, and
   sociodemographic factors. Survey results indicate variability in market
   and social acceptance of renewables between stakeholders and countries.
   The investment cost of the technologies is identified as a barrier to
   adoption for all countries. Legal and organizational issues are
   identified as barriers in Spain. Economic and legal barriers are
   identified as barriers in Latvia and Belgium. The respondents from
   Germany only identify investment cost as a barrier. Economic aspects are
   identified as the main barriers among public building owners and the
   general public. Businesspeople identified the largest number of
   barriers, including economic aspects, lack of information, trust,
   business models, and legal issues, while private building owners
   identified the least number of barriers, with concerns only related to
   economic aspects. Results of this study provide valuable information for
   policymaking focused on increasing the adoption of renewables in the
   building sector. Additionally, this study identifies the need to
   increase environmental awareness among citizens and increase the
   availability of information about technologies to stakeholders. Citizens
   should be informed about the recoupment of the investment costs of the
   technologies to offset the perception of high investment costs, long
   payback time, and lack of proper business models.},

Abstract = {The complex data exchange between architectural design and building
   energy simulation constitutes the main challenge in the use of energy
   performance analyses in the early design stage. The enhancement of BIM
   model data with additional specific energy-related information and the
   subsequent mapping to the input of an energy analysis or simulation tool
   is yet an open issue. This paper examines three approaches for the data
   transfer from 3D CAD applications to building performance simulations
   using BIM as central data repository and points out their current and
   envisaged use in practice. The first approach addresses design
   scenarios. It focuses on the supporting tools needed to achieve
   interoperability given a wide-spread commercial BIM model (Autodesk
   Revit) and a dedicated pre-processing tool (DesignBuilder) for
   EnergyPlus. The second approach is similar but addresses retrofitting
   scenarios. In both workflows gbXML is used as the transformation format.
   In the third approach a standard BIM model, IFC is used as basis for the
   transfer pro cess for any relevant lifecycle phase.},

Abstract = {In the past five years (in both the professional communication and
   technical writing communities), there has been much emphasis on single
   sourcing and content management, specifically on how to (and why you
   would want to) ``unify{''} content across a documentation set, a
   department, or an entire organization. At the Rockley Group, we work
   with many organizations that are implementing single sourcing or
   ``unified content{''} strategies. We start by conducting an audit of
   their current information products and content life cycles, followed by
   building information models that reflect clients' desired reuse
   strategy. Information modeling is critical to a unified content
   strategy. Information models depict the structure of information
   products; they show how and where elements are reused, and they include
   the metadata that further describes how elements are used, retrieved,
   and tracked Information models are the specification for a unified
   content strategy, but information modeling brings a new set of
   challenges to those creating, reviewing, and implementing the models.
   This paper provides a brief overview of unified content, then explores
   some of the issues specific to information modeling, including:
   Teaching authors to create, read, review, and implement models
   Distinguishing between reusable structure and reusable content
   Visually representing information structure
   Implementing models, specifically, understanding how writing to a model
   will affect the writing process.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},

Pages = {273-284},
Abstract = {As a processing technology of data and information, building information
   modeling (BIM) is often used for producing digital engineering model and
   promoting interoperability among participants involved in the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The real
   values of BIM largely depend on effective information integrating and
   sharing among different stages or disciplines through the whole building
   lifecycle. To this day, although BIM has made a substantial contribution
   to the Chinese AEC industry, there are still some debates on its roles.
   Moreover, due to the complexity of structural design process, the weak
   link between structural model and BIM model makes its deep application
   even harder. To address these issues, this paper discusses the roles of
   BIM from the perspective of structural engineers through comparing with
   the traditional CAD. Then, the BIM structural model is studied by
   analyzing the model conformation, design mode, and Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC)-format structural model. By comparing the differences
   between BIM physical model and structural mechanical model, an indirect
   method for the data transformation from BIM model to structural analysis
   model is proposed. An interface is developed based on the analysis of
   data formats and mapping rules. Three typical cases are adopted to
   demonstrate the data transfer efficiency by using the interface. The
   case study shows that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency for
   the data transformation from BIM model to structural analysis model.},

Title = {RISK FRAMEWORK FOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE CONTRACTING BUILDING RETROFITS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-115},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Energy performance contracting (EPC) has emerged as a useful project
   financing and delivery tool for building retrofits, particularly among
   building ownerships which have experienced reduced funding for capital
   projects. Through EPC, a contractor (called the EPC contractor or the
   energy service company) guarantees minimum energy savings performance
   and enables the building owner to finance the project using utility
   savings over the length of the project (which is typically 12-15 years,
   or longer). Despite its growing use, there is a dearth of literature
   regarding a contractor's risks related to the delivery and execution of
   EPC building retrofits. This is particularly important as the
   performance guarantee effectively transfers project performance risk
   from the owner to the EPC contractor. This research proposes a project
   factors-based risk framework for EPC building retrofits, initially
   developed through a comprehensive review of relevant literature and
   project documents and refined through the elicited expertise of 19
   highly experienced EPC contracting professionals. A Delphi
   technique-based expertise elicitation strategy was used to confirm the
   findings of the a priori (literature-based) framework and provide
   additional analysis related to risk causes and control measures as well
   as relative risk importance. This information was used to construct a
   refined risk framework which provides insight into the lengthy project
   performance period during the earliest phases of the project's life
   cycle. This has the advantage of providing rapid screening of the
   project factors that can potentially lead to the greatest project
   performance risks.},

Title = {Building material stock analysis is critical for effective circular
   economy strategies: a comprehensive review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Buildings account for the largest share of accumulated materials and
   waste globally. Tracking the material composition, quantity and location
   of these materials, known as building material stock analysis (MSA), is
   a first step in enabling the reuse or repurposing of materials, key
   strategies of the circular economy. While the number of building MSAs is
   growing, there is a need to coalesce methods, data and scope. Therefore,
   in this work, we reviewed and evaluated 62 journal and conference
   articles on MSA of buildings from different angles including scope,
   boundaries, archetype classification, material intensity determination,
   approaches (i.e. bottom-up, top-down, remote sensing) and quantity of
   materials to identify barriers, gaps and opportunities in this area
   along with its implications for decision-making, policy and regulations.
   We cataloged the three major approaches of MSAs and discuss their
   advantages and shortcomings. We also created a comprehensive directory
   of building archetypes, references and materials for future researchers.
   As expected, most of the studies estimated that concrete had the largest
   mass compared with other materials; however, mass-based distribution of
   materials showed significant variations in different building stocks
   across the world. Also, embedded plastics and their types remain
   under-represented in current studies. A major barrier to MSA is related
   to a lack of information on physical attributes and geographic
   information system, design and construction data. Policy makers can play
   a role in mitigating data barriers through instituting regulations that
   enforce the reporting of building-related data during the permitting
   process. Furthermore, outcomes of building MSA can help policy makers
   when considering incentives for design and construction that utilize
   these abundant building materials.},

Abstract = {Deconstruction is an innovative and sustainable option for building
   end-of-life. It can turn the negative impacts of demolition, including
   diverting valuable resources from the congested landfill into beneficial
   use through reuse and recycling. However, the feasibility of
   deconstruction has placed a massive limitation on the implementation of
   deconstruction. This research carried out a systematic literature review
   of 35 academic and 3 non-academic pieces of literature to develop a
   construct-based deconstructability framework. This framework - built
   around technical, economic, legal, operational, schedule and social
   construct - describes the condition under which deconstruction is likely
   to work and drivers influencing deconstructability. A total of 44
   drivers influencing deconstructability were established and ranked from
   which design and building technology, cost including expense and
   revenues from the resale, supply and demand of the recovered component
   and material, the schedule for the deconstruction were identified as
   most influential. However, every identified driver should be considered
   during the deconstructability assessment of a building.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling has been embraced and determined to be a
   core component of the undergraduate construction management program at
   several major universities across the United States. Currently, in some
   programs, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is being taught in a
   lecture - lab setting in Project Management courses. Industry
   involvement has continued to improve the course offering by including
   relevant areas of information and skills needed to enter the workforce.
   However, it is critical to capitalize on both the intra and
   interdisciplinary collaborative aspect of BIM to set higher standards
   for research and development, education and practice. It is essential to
   grow and build upon these aspects to remain current with the changing
   trends in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.
   This paper summarizes the research to develop a curriculum progression
   involving the use of BIM tools at every relevant stage of a student's
   academic career, culminating in a capstone project as a Virtual
   Construction and Collaboration Lab.
   The Virtual Construction and Collaboration Lab ((VCL)-L-2) is a pod
   based collaborative learning environment at the Del Webb School of
   Construction (DEWSC), Arizona State University, wherein
   interdisciplinary groups of students can investigate real-world projects
   from the viewpoint of industry representatives in their own particular
   field of study. Collaboration is a team assignment, modeling the project
   life cycle, concentrating on the pre-construction phases as this is when
   major decisions regarding contract schedule and cost are confirmed. At
   this stage, students are engaged in not just learning the tools that
   constitute BIM, but in applying these tools to add and extract
   information to better aid the construction process. Lab time is preceded
   and supported by a Project Management lecture; then (VCL)-L-2 provides
   the environment to test and execute BIM on real life projects.
   In order to provide this level of expertise in students as they progress
   through the undergraduate level, it is essential they are well versed
   with the software applications ahead in their academic coursework. As a
   result, students are introduced to digital modeling through Autodesk (R)
   Revit (R), at the 200 (sophomore) level, along with reading blueprints
   through a Construction Working Drawing Analysis course. To further
   increase the knowledge for future applications, at the 300 (junior)
   level a class is offered in a variety of software applications such as
   Autodesk (R) Revit (R), Navisworks (R), and SketchUp. This class
   provides the basic application of these tools in a construction setting.
   A capstone elective course will provide students with an extensive BIM
   experience for those wanting to be immersed in construction applications
   beyond the basic quantity take-off, scheduling, and site layout.
   As the industry grows and adapts to the latest trends, it is essential
   that students follow suit and go one step further. Academia must mirror
   the permeability of BIM in all the levels of courses offered in a
   Construction Management program.},

Title = {A knowledge graph-based framework to automate the generation of building
   energy models using geometric relation checking and HVAC topology

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Building Energy Models (BEM) are widely utilized throughout all stages
   of a building's lifecycle to understand and enhance energy usage.
   However, creating these models demands significant effort, particularly
   for larger buildings or those with complex HVAC systems. While a
   substantial amount of information can be extracted from Building
   Information Models (BIM) - which are increasingly accessible and provide
   necessary data for geometric and HVAC contexts - this information is not
   readily usable in setting up BEM and typically requires manual
   translation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a
   BIM-to-BEM (BIM2BEM) framework that focuses on automating the generation
   of HVAC parts of BEM models from BIM data. Core to the methodology is
   the extraction of HVAC system topologies from the BIM model and the
   creation of a knowledge graph with the HVAC topology. The topology
   transformation unfolds in three key stages: first, a geometry-induced
   knowledge graph is established by examining the geometric relationships
   among HVAC elements; second, this graph is converted into an informative
   HVAC topology with enhanced properties from additional data sources; and
   finally, the informative topology is simplified into a BEM-oriented HVAC
   topology compliant with BEM platforms such as EnergyPlus. A case study
   of a large university building with a complex HVAC system showcases that
   the proposed framework achieves automatic and precise generation of
   building performance simulation models. The model's predictions are then
   validated against actual measurements from the building.},

Abstract = {Embodied energy/CO2 computational models can help decision-makers choose
   appropriate technologies, building materials, systems and processes that
   minimize impacts on the environment. While existing models have been
   great in the assessment process, they often suffer from two main
   weaknesses. Firstly, models exist in silos and only fit for computing
   individual material type at any one time. Secondly, computational
   results obtained from most models are not aligned to standard
   measurement methods used in practice. In this study, a system that can
   automate the computation of embodied energy/CO2 of buildings and aligns
   the results to the UK New Rules of Measurement (NRM) has been proposed.
   The developed system was tested using case study houses with known
   dimensions. It allows the simultaneous determination of embodied
   energy/CO2 and cost and aligns the results to the UK NRM concepts. This
   is useful for simultaneously determining the environmental impact of
   building components and their corresponding costs.},

Abstract = {Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) play a crucial role in the
   building project life cycle, especially during construction, as
   discrepancies between as-built structures and as-designed models can
   lead to cost overruns and schedule delays. Ensuring building quality is
   of utmost importance, but traditional manual inspections suffer from
   errors, consume time, and incur significant expenses. This paper
   describes a deviation detection method for building components using
   synthetic point clouds and semantic segmentation models. The method
   entails training a three-dimensional semantic segmentation model using
   synthetic point clouds generated from BIM to label each point with an
   object class, resulting in a mean IoU of 41.1\% in semantic
   segmentation. Subsequently, real point clouds collected onsite are
   segmented using the same model and then compared with the synthetic
   point cloud to assess the disparities between the building components of
   the as-designed and as-built structures. This approach can improve the
   efficiency of QA/QC by reducing the manual workload of field inspectors.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 29},
Abstract = {PurposeThe compliance checking of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   models is crucial throughout the lifecycle of construction. The
   increasing amount and complexity of information carried by BIM models
   have made compliance checking more challenging, and manual methods are
   prone to errors. Therefore, this study aims to propose an integrative
   conceptual framework for automated compliance checking of BIM models,
   allowing for the identification of errors within BIM
   models.Design/methodology/approachThis study first analyzed the typical
   building standards in the field of architecture and fire protection, and
   then the ontology of these elements is developed. Based on this, a
   building standard corpus is built, and deep learning models are trained
   to automatically label the building standard texts. The Neo4j is
   utilized for knowledge graph construction and storage, and a data
   extraction method based on the Dynamo is designed to obtain checking
   data files. After that, a matching algorithm is devised to express the
   logical rules of knowledge graph triples, resulting in automated
   compliance checking for BIM models.FindingsCase validation results
   showed that this theoretical framework can achieve the automatic
   construction of domain knowledge graphs and automatic checking of BIM
   model compliance. Compared with traditional methods, this method has a
   higher degree of automation and portability.Originality/valueThis study
   introduces knowledge graphs and natural language processing technology
   into the field of BIM model checking and completes the automated process
   of constructing domain knowledge graphs and checking BIM model data. The
   validation of its functionality and usability through two case studies

Abstract = {The project phase is where the life-cycle of a building starts. The best
   decisions are made during the design or pre-project step. In terms of
   both economic resources and time, changes to specific design decisions
   made at this step are inexpensive compared to subsequent steps of
   architectural planning, not to mention the course of the construction's
   operation itself. The choices made during the design phase determine to
   a large extent whether the architectural design decisions ofa building
   are achieved, whether the building and site can be used appropriately,
   and whether the project is economically viable. With BIM, building
   spatial planning is possible. As a result, architects can evaluate the
   proposed structure, its impact on the ecology, and the ecology's impact
   on the structure more comprehensively and at an earlier stage. This
   research proposes an energy modeling approach for the BIM-based spatial
   planning phase of a construction. The proposed method will result in an
   energy model for specific sites and building resolutions when utilized
   to create a spatial modelling for a construction. The energy model can
   then be used for new architectural creations. In this study, 36
   different alternative scenarios were designed in terms of the rate of
   construction height to construction spacing, orientation factor, and
   form factor. With the help of BIM and GBS softwares, the energy
   consumption values of the alternative scenarios in cooling and heating
   load conditions were compared, and the alternative scenario with the
   minimum energy consumption was tried to be determined with spatial
   planning parameters.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled Extended Reality (XR)
   applications have already benefited the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry in many tasks. However, the lack of
   knowledge on a generic XR (GenXR) model has obstructed efficient
   BIM-to-XR model transfer. This paper proposes a GenXR model that
   supports XR development in a project's lifecycle. The model bypasses
   repetitive activities in traditional BIM-to-XR. The authors developed
   six XR prototypes in two case studies to validate the GenXR model.
   Results show that the GenXR model supports typical model-related XR
   functions. Developing the GenXR model could save 63.8\% to 66.7\% in
   development time. Thus, a GenXR model could enable project engineers to
   leverage interactive visualization in a variety of use cases, where more
   appropriate technologies can be implemented with less technical or
   financial constraints. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge
   by creating a GenXR model with validations on information requirements,
   workflow, and performance.},

Title = {A project management framework for enhanced productivity performance
   using building information modelling},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION ECONOMICS AND BUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1-26},
Abstract = {Although the Singapore government has mandated submissions of building
   plans in building information modelling (BIM) format since July 2013,
   this does not yet seem to lead to enhanced productivity performance. BIM
   collaboration between designers and downstream contractors appears to
   remain inadequate. While many studies have been conducted on using BIM
   for better project outcomes, studies that relate BIM with the
   identification of non-value adding activities in the project lifecycle
   and the reduction of the resulting wastes are at infancy stage. This
   paper aims to propose a project management framework for enhancing the
   productivity of building projects in Singapore, which forms Phase I of
   an ongoing research project. A two-pronged approach is presented.
   Firstly, non-value adding activities in the current project delivery
   process that uses BIM partially in Singapore are identified by comparing
   the typical current process with full BIM-based processes; such
   activities are cut down after process transformation in terms of people,
   process, and technology. Secondly, time savings derived from reducing
   the wastes caused by these activities are quantified. The proposed
   framework was validated by a case study of a local residential project.
   It was concluded that this framework provides a valuable tool for
   project teams to enhance productivity performance.},

Title = {Modeling indoor thermal comfort in buildings using digital twin and
   machine learning},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) concept is used in different domains and industries,
   including the building industry, as it has physical and digital assets
   with the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Technologies and
   methodologies constantly enrich the building industry because the amount
   of data generated during different building stages is considerable and
   has a tremendous effect on the lifecycle of a building. Previous
   research underscores the importance of seamlessly exchanging information
   between physical and digital assets within a comprehensive framework,
   particularly emphasizing the integration of BIM data with various
   systems to enhance efficiency and prevent information loss. Despite
   advancements in technologies, challenges persist in optimizing methods
   for integrating BIM data into DT frameworks, including ensuring
   interoperability, scalability, and real-time monitor and control. This
   study addresses this research gap by proposing a comprehensive platform
   that integrates the DT concept with IoT and BIM technologies. The
   platform is developed in five main stages: 1) acquiring electronic data
   of the building from the laser scanner, 2) developing a Wi-Fi IoT module
   and BIM data for physical assets and digital replica, 3) constructing
   the DT elements of the platform, 4) performing data analysis 5)
   implementing thermal comfort prediction models. Two machine learning
   models (Facebook prophet, NeuralProphet) are implemented to predict
   thermal comfort. The best predictive model is identified by evaluating
   its error function using historical training data collected during
   facility operation. A case study demonstrates the practical application
   of the proposed framework. The case study involves a real building where
   the platform is implemented to monitor and control indoor environments.
   By utilizing predefined data in BIM models, the platform ensures data
   accuracy, consistency, and usability. The case outputs reveal that
   Neuralprophet provides good prediction results.},

Title = {A Novel Approach for As-Built BIM Updating Using Inertial Measurement
   Unit and Mobile Laser Scanner},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has recently been widely applied in
   the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry (AEC). BIM
   graphical information can provide a more intuitive display of the
   building and its contents. However, during the Operation and Maintenance
   (O\&M) stage of the building lifecycle, changes may occur in the
   building's contents and cause inaccuracies in the BIM model, which could
   lead to inappropriate decisions. This study aims to address this issue
   by proposing a novel approach to creating 3D point clouds for updating
   as-built BIM models. The proposed approach is based on Pedestrian Dead
   Reckoning (PDR) for an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated with a
   Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS) to create room-based 3D point clouds. Unlike
   conventional methods previously undertaken where a Terrestrial Laser
   Scanner (TLS) is used, the proposed approach utilizes low-cost MLS in
   combination with IMU to replace the TLS for indoor scanning. The
   approach eliminates the process of selecting scanning points and
   leveling of the TLS, enabling a more efficient and cost-effective
   creation of the point clouds. Scanning of three buildings with varying
   sizes and shapes was conducted. The results indicated that the proposed
   approach created room-based 3D point clouds with centimeter-level
   accuracy; it also proved to be more efficient than the TLS in updating
   the BIM models.},

Abstract = {A building information model (BIM) contains data that can be accessed
   and exported for other uses during the lifetime of the building
   especially for facilities management (FM) and operations. Working under
   the guidance of well-designed BIM guidelines to insure completeness and
   compatibility with FM software, architects and contractors can deliver
   an information rich data model that is valuable to the client. Large
   owners such as universities often provide these detailed guidelines and
   deliverable requirements to their building teams. Investigation of the
   University of Southern California (USC) Facilities Management Service's
   (FMS) website showed a detailed plan including standards, file names,
   parameter lists, and other requirements of BIM data, which were
   specifically designated for facilities management use, as deliverables
   on new construction projects. Three critical details were also unearthed
   in the reading of these documents: Revit was the default BIM software;
   COBie was adapted to help meet facilities management goals; and EcoDomus
   provided a display of the collected data viewed through Navisworks.
   Published accounts about the Cinema Arts Complex developed with and
   under these guidelines reported positive results. Further examination
   with new projects underway reveal the rapidly changing relational
   database landscape evident in the new USC ``Project Record Revit

Abstract = {The BIM marks a new age for Architecture, Engineering and professionals
   Construction - AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction), not
   only they will save time on having created and to modify their projects
   but also they will facilitate the top-level of interaction with their
   collaborators, partners or colleagues, on having shared specific
   contents of every speciality in the same BIM model.
   We can modify our teaching with the new technologies, or using
   traditional methods with other approaches. At this moment the difference
   between drawing by computer and the BIM Objects in 3D BIM is synonymous
   of Building Information Modelling (Shaped with Information for the
   Construction). Whereas CAD's program uses only 2D or 3D geometry in
   without differentiating the elements, the BIM programs uses libraries of
   intelligent and parametrical objects, interprets logical interaction
   between the different types of objects and stores the information
   relating to these objects.
   That's the reason why it seems important to us, to analyses the studies
   that had been realized in these field or that were realized, in order to
   obtain a few future lines of action to face the challenge that the
   integration to the European Space of Top Education and the world
   Promotion of an European system of Top Education takes us
   We are going to study the different educational methodologies in which
   we are working now, compiling the educational experiences developed in
   the Technical Top School of Building, Technical University of Madrid
   (UPM), applied to several Educational different Units.
   The importance of the student's preparation in the technological area is
   each day more obvious. The preparation of our pupils in the
   communication and information technologies is essential, not only
   because they will be an object of its curriculum in later studies, but
   because they will be a fundamental tool in its professional work in
   whatever its dedication. We must introduce our pupils in subjects as
   Computer science or virtual presentations, as well as in the development
   of the teamwork. It is necessary to prepare them for the needs that
   society demands and the development of their professional exercise.
   Simulating reality it is possible to take better decisions in the
   project stage. This way also foresees many of the problems that will
   arise in the life cycle of the building.
   The University must be capable of providing qualified graduates to
   develop the reality and current requirements that professional exercise
   demands. It is necessary that future professionals are prepared in the
   knowledge and utilization of distance learning, making them easier the
   possibility of being prepared in this topic.},

Title = {Building energy retrofit simulation for exploring decarbonization
   pathways in a community-scale food-energy-water-waste nexus},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {87},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The retrofit of existing buildings at a community scale can provide a
   huge opportunity to reduce the community's energy consumption and
   subsequent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in support of the United
   Nations agenda for net-zero emissions and decarbonization. This study
   demonstrates a community-scale food-energy-water -waste nexus through 6
   alternatives (A1-A6) by highlighting decarbonization pathways with
   system dynamics modeling. Several potential retrofit alternatives are
   proposed for analyzing building energy consumption, energy requirements
   for rooftop or greenhouse crop production, and potential energy and
   water savings from renewable energy harvesting. Such a nexus analysis is
   designed to integrate (1) building energy consumption, (2) waste
   management and water consumption, and (3) GHG emissions based on
   life-cycle assessment to prioritize al-ternatives. The incorporation of
   solar photovoltaic (PV) systems (i.e., rooftop, parking lot, parking
   garage, and floating solar PV) sustains approximately 72\% of net energy
   demand (alternative A3), while the integration of all solar, wind, and
   anaerobic digestion alternatives provides around 41\% of net energy
   demand (alternative A6). It is vital to emphasize decarbonization
   pathways through the use of renewable energy by 2030 in alternative A5
   (i. e., solar and wind energy) and A6, both of which avoid energy
   consumption from the utility grid and result in 250\% total carbon
   emissions offset.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to propose a methodology to support the
   production of Climate and Energy Plans in Norwegian municipalities by
   analyzing whether locally available woody biomass, specifically forest
   logging residues, within the municipality (in this case, Fredrikstad),
   could cover the demand for heating in municipality buildings over the
   next 20 years. Three different tools, a geoprocessing tool for forestry
   (GEOSKOG), a methodology for environmental assessment (Life Cycle
   Assessment) and a tool for processing geographical data (Geographical
   Information System), were used in combination with energy data related
   to municipal buildings. The goal was to quantify the share of energy
   end-use (heat) that could potentially be replaced by bioenergy from
   forest logging residues and to calculate the potential GHG benefits from
   this substitution. The annual heating demand for municipal buildings in
   Fredrilcstad currently heated by electric and oil boilers was 93 GWh.
   The potential annual GHG savings from the bioenergy substitution of
   fossil fuel (oil) boilers and electric boilers (Norwegian and Nordic
   electricity mix) equaled 292 tonnes CO2-eq, 95 tonnes CO2-eq and 535
   tonnes CO2-eq respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the evolving Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
   industry, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Integrated
   Project Cloud Service (IPCS) has become crucial. These tools are
   particularly essential during the early design stages, as they enable
   comprehensive management and integration of project information, thus
   promoting effective decision-making throughout project lifecycles. This
   combined approach enhances inter-organizational collaborations, improves
   design and construction practices, and creates a communal data platform
   for stakeholders. This research explores the effectiveness of the
   BIM-IPCS system in streamlining data exchange and information flow
   during early design, suggesting ways to minimize errors, speed up
   processes, and reduce construction costs through dependable networks.
   Conclusively, this study underscores the significant impact of the
   BIM-IPCS system on project management, ensuring well-coordinated and
   informed construction while advocating for its role in driving
   innovative and efficient project delivery in the AEC industry.},

Abstract = {In the framework of an increasingly demanding legislation related to
   energy performance in buildings, the integration of photovoltaic systems
   in the building skin offers many possibilities and has a key role to
   play towards bioclimatic buildings. Therefore, practically, the most
   important technological challenges toward energy-efficient buildings are
   twofold: (i) bioclimatic design, considering eco-friendly sources as
   well as renewable and durable material, and (ii) Building Information
   Modelling methodology for the whole architecture, engineering and
   construction (AEC) process to support the simulation, visualization and
   management of a building's performance throughout its lifecycle. This
   paper addresses the ambition put on merging high performance computing,
   scientific models and methodologies for energy modeling, user friendly
   software tools and web based services, together with collaborative
   processes supporting sustainable design towards positive energy
   buildings, active skins and the emerging Building Integrated Photo
   Voltaic materials.
   The EU-funded PVSITES project focuses on these needs with the
   development of BIM-based software for the simulation of BIPV products
   and forecasting their impact on building energy performance. This
   project aims at contributing to the uptake of both BIPV implementation
   and its integration within a holistic BIM process.},

Title = {A Proposal for Streamlining 3D Digital Cadastral Data Lifecycle},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, managing the lifecycle of land and property data related
   to interlocked and intertwined structures and infrastructure services is
   a grand challenge for cadastral systems. Addressing the physical and
   legal complexities of vertically stratified ownership arrangements is a
   major step towards the modernization of cadastral systems. The research
   problem that this study addresses is the lack of a simplified and
   effective approach for modelling, storing, visualizing, and querying 3D
   cadastral data for multi-story buildings. This research primarily leads
   to the development of an approach based on Building Information
   Modelling (BIM), as well as state-of-the-art ETL (extract, transform,
   load), database and visualization technologies for 3D cadastral data
   lifecycle management in current practices. The proposed steps for
   recording, preserving, and disseminating 3D cadastral data are crucial
   in shifting current 2D cadastral systems towards 3D digital information
   systems. The results showed improvements in data creation, storage,
   conversion, and communication when upgrading from a 2D to 3D digital
   cadastre. Therefore, this study confirmed that streamlining the
   lifecycle of cadastral data using 3D environments would mitigate issues
   associated with the current fragmented 2D cadastral datasets used in the
   multi-story developments.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper seeks to identify the most environmental friendly way
   of conducting a refurbishment of Broendby Strand, with focus on PCB
   remediation. The actual identification is conducted by comparing four
   remediation techniques using urban metabolism fused with life cycle
   assessment (UM-LCA) in combination with information relating to cost and
   efficiency of the compared techniques. The methodological goal of our
   paper is to test UM-LCA as a decision support tool and discuss
   application of the method in relation to large refurbishment
   projects.MethodsTo assess the environmental performance of
   PCB-remediation techniques, the UM-LCA method was applied. By combining
   UM and LCA methodologies, the total environmental impact potentials of
   the remediation techniques were calculated. To build an inventory for
   each technique, we contacted and interviewed experts and studied
   existing literature, cases, and projects in order to compile information
   on practical details of the techniques. To process the collected
   inventory data, we used the simplified product system modeling software
   Quantis Suite 2.0 (QS2.0). In order to validate the results from the
   simplified software, we carried out the exact same analysis using a more
   complex toolOpenLCA 1.5. Based on the assessment results, we compared
   the remediation techniques and identified the techniques with the
   smallest and largest environmental impact potentials.Results and
   discussionThe results obtained are presented, and the technique with the
   smallest impact identified. A comparison between the two software tools
   applied is made, and differences between the two are discussed in
   detail. Further discussed is how possible inventory errors affect the
   results and if any assumptions should be considered as critical for the
   final results. Furthermore, are the remediation efficiencies of each
   technique and the cost of each method considered and compared. Finally,
   UM-LCA's ability to work as a tool for decision support is discussed and
   possible ways of implementing the method in sustainable decision-making
   is considered.ConclusionsIn this study, it is found that the most
   environmental friendly PCB-remediation technique is thermal desorption,
   whereas the technique with the largest environmental impact potential is
   sand blasting, due to the environmental impacts induced in relation to
   disposal of the building waste. It is concluded that the UM-LCA method
   can be applied as a tool for decision support, and if economic aspects
   are incorporated, the UM-LCA approach could be an essential approach for
   designing sustainable buildings.},

Title = {Augmented Reality for Building Authorities: A Use Case Study in Austria},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The widespread usage of BIM and technological advances in augmented
   reality (AR) paves the way for Construction 4.0. This digital
   transformation has reached the construction industry and requires
   consideration of all life cycle phases. The approval phase has been
   little researched to date. In Vienna, the analogous process takes up to
   18 months. This long duration inhibits progress in the building
   industry. One reason for this is objections from parties who are
   nonexperts and have difficulty understanding the project solely from its
   2D plans. Therefore, the City of Vienna wants to redesign the building
   authority processes through the use of BIM and AR in the BRISE-Vienna
   research project. This article examines possible applications for public
   authorities. AR can be utilised at the interface between authorities and
   stakeholders and is intended to accelerate processes through better
   communication. For the City of Vienna, 12 AR use cases were developed
   from process analyses and expert interviews. In addition to the
   conception of the AR use cases for public authorities, a study was
   carried out regarding their benefits and feasibility. The use cases have
   the potential to increase the understanding of the project for experts
   and nonexperts. The best-rated AR use cases (plan checking and hearing
   during the permission process) will be further developed in the research
   project. The AR use cases should help to significantly accelerate
   processes in Vienna and, thus, serve as a basis for other cities and
   countries.},

Title = {Dynamic relationship between embodied and operational impacts of
   buildings: An evaluation of sustainable design appraisal tools},
Journal = {WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {70-81},
Abstract = {Purpose Buildings and their construction activities consume a
   significant proportion of mineral resources excavated from nature and
   contribute a large percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a way of
   improving the sustainability of building construction and operation,
   various sustainable design appraisal standards have been developed
   across nations. Albeit criticism of the appraisal standards, evidence
   shows that increasing sustainability of the built environment has been
   engendered by such appraisal tools as Building Research Establishment
   Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Code for Sustainable Homes
   (CfSH), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and Comprehensive
   Assessment System for Built Environment Efficacy, among others. The
   purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the appraisal
   standards in engendering whole lifecycle environmental sustainability of
   the built environment.
   Design/methodology/approach In order to evaluate the adequacy of
   sustainability scores assigned to various lifecycle stages of buildings
   in the appraisal standards, four case studies of a block of classroom
   were modelled. Using Revit as a modelling platform, stage by stage
   lifecycle environmental impacts of the building were simulated through
   Green Building Studio and ATHENA Impact estimator. The resulting
   environmental impacts were then compared against the assessment score
   associated with each stage of building lifecycle in BREAAM and CfSH.
   Findings Results show that albeit the consensus that the appraisal
   standards engender sustainability practices in the AEC industry, total
   scores assigned to impacts at each stage of building lifecycle is
   disproportionate to the simulated whole-life environmental impacts
   associated with the stages in some instances.
   Originality/value As the study reveals both strengths and weaknesses in
   the existing sustainability appraisal standards, measures through which
   they can be tailored to resource efficiency and lifecycle environmental
   sustainability of the built environment are suggested.},

Title = {Automatic BIM component extraction from point clouds of existing
   buildings for sustainability applications},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building information models (BIMs) are increasingly being applied
   throughout a building's lifecycle for various applications, such as
   progressive construction monitoring and defect detection, building
   renovation, energy simulation, and building system analysis in the
   Architectural, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC/FM) domains. In conventional approaches, as-is BIM is primarily
   manually created from point clouds, which is labor-intensive, costly,
   and time consuming. This paper proposes a method for automatically
   extracting building geometries from unorganized point clouds. The
   collected raw data undergo data downsizing, boundary detection, and
   building component categorization, resulting in the building components
   being recognized as individual objects and their visualization as
   polygons. The results of tests conducted on three collected as-is
   building data to validate the technical feasibility and evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method indicate that it can simplify and
   accelerate the as-is building model from the point cloud creation
   process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Continuous model calibration framework for smart-building digital twin:
   A generative model-based approach},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {375},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Smart building digital twins represent a significant paradigm shift to
   optimize building operations, thereby reducing their substantial energy
   consumption and emissions through digitalization. The objective is to
   virtually replicate existing buildings' static and dynamic aspects,
   leveraging data, information, and models spanning the entire life cycle.
   The virtual replica can then be employed for intelligent functions,
   including real-time monitoring, autonomous control, and proactive
   decision-making to optimize building operations. To enable proactive
   decisions, models within the digital twin must continually evolve with
   changes in the physical building, aligning their outputs with real-time
   measurements through calibration. This continuous updating requires
   real-time physical measurements of model inputs. However, challenges
   arise in the uncertain conditions of buildings marked by sensor absence,
   malfunctions, and inherent limitations in measuring certain variables.
   This study introduces a novel calibration framework for physics-based
   models, addressing the challenges of continuous model calibration in
   smart-building digital twins while considering the uncertain environment
   of physical buildings. Within this framework, a novel generative
   model-based architecture is proposed. This architecture enables a fast
   and scalable solution while quantifying uncertainty for reliable
   calibration. Furthermore, a continuous model calibration procedure is
   presented based on a pre-trained generative calibrator model. A
   comprehensive evaluation was conducted via a case study employing a
   building energy model and multiple experiments. The experimental results
   demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addresses the
   challenges of continuous model calibration in smart-building digital
   twins. The calibrator model accurately quantified uncertainties in its
   predictions and solved a single calibration problem in an average time
   of 0.043 second. For facility-level electricity consumption, Coefficient
   of Variation Root Mean Squared Error (CVRMSE) values of 6.33\%, 10.18\%,
   and 10.97\% were achieved under conditions of observations without noise
   or missing data, with noise, and with noise and missing data,
   respectively. Similarly, for facility-level gas consumption, the
   corresponding values were 18.75\%, 20.53\%, and 20.7\%. The CVRMSE
   scores in both cases met the standard hourly thresholds for building
   energy model calibration.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is notorious for being unsustainable and
   disintegrated industry while, it is crucial to provide a lens towards
   sustainable construction from the digital innovation and integration
   perspective. Although a considerable amount of research has been focused
   on how building information modeling (BIM) helps improve sustainable
   construction; there are still a limited number of studies that have
   investigated the BIM process in sustainability fields. This study aims
   to identify all common domains of BIM and sustainability applications
   and reveals the academic and practice gaps in the construction industry.
   Through employing the scientometric analysis method, a collective number
   of 188 journal articles were gathered and analyzed. The thematic
   analysis was then applied and five common domains of BIM and
   sustainability on lifecycle assessment, green buildings criteria, energy
   analysis, environmental assessments and design, construction and project
   management were eventually identified. The current study identifies the
   research confusion, neglect and application gaps across all five
   identified domains and provides researchers with a deep understanding of
   BIM in the sustainability and future directions for further research.},

Abstract = {Buildings? functional and physical characteristics can be digitally
   represented through Building Information Modelling (BIM) which creates a
   sharing platform for all stakeholders involved in the project lifecycle.
   The application of BIM has been studied throughout the years mainly in
   new buildings with less emphasis in refurbishing existing ones due to
   the limited availability of accurate data of the original project.
   However, maintaining and refurbishing existing buildings often
   contributes to higher risk and cost. In addition, more buildings are
   required to undertake building assessment schemes such as Building
   Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM),
   Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Star, Green
   Mark, and Green Building Index (GBI) ? most were not designed to assess
   existing buildings. In this sense, laser scanning can be used to collect
   existing parametric building data as point clouds, which can be
   developed and used for modelling of energy consumption, comfort and
   costing. This can be then translated back into assessment schemes. The
   aim of this paper is to demonstrate the process flow in the usage of
   laser scanning for existing buildings to support sustainability-led
   design by a new scan-to-BIM process.},

Title = {Optimized Building Component Assessment Planning Using a Value of
   Information Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Facility condition assessments are a key aspect of a proactive asset
   management approach, as they provide the information necessary to
   determine current conditions and work needs, as well as forecasting
   future conditions to identify long-range work planning requirements.
   While these assessments can provide a benefit to asset management
   decision making, they also require resources in terms of time,
   personnel, and funding. When these resources are finite, as they
   typically are in facility management, it is important to understand the
   value that an assessment can provide. Of particular interest to facility
   managers is determining the optimal time to inspect the components of a
   building to maximize this value. To achieve this, the paper presents a
   methodology to calculate the value that building component inspection
   information provides toward the work planning decision process. The
   methodology uses a value of information decision tree with a Markov
   component condition prediction model to calculate the probability of
   failure. This approach considers the time since the last inspection
   occurred, the expected condition state of the component, the risk
   consequence associated with failure, and the cost of risk mitigation
   related to proactive repair or replacement activities. Results of an
   applied case study indicate that there is indeed an optimal time since
   the last inspection that optimizes this value, allowing managers to
   better allocate scarce inspection resources using this model. In
   addition, varying inspection types with different levels of detail and
   accuracy can be analyzed, allowing for a selection of the best type of
   inspection to perform given the component life-cycle situation, in
   addition to the inspection frequency.},

   Representations Under the Digital Twin Concept},
Journal = {ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-27},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a highly promising technique for
   achieving digitalization in the construction industry, widely used in
   modern construction projects for digitally representing facilities.
   Nevertheless, retains limitations in terms of representing construction
   operations. The digital twin concept may potentially overcome these
   limitations and initiate advanced digital transformation in the
   construction industry as it has revolutionized the product lifecycle
   management in the manufacturing industry. This research provides a
   critical review of applying digital twin in the construction industry.
   Altogether, 140 papers from related journals and databases were
   reviewed. The digital aspect of twinning consists of BIM and simulation
   modeling. These two techniques have been used to create virtual or
   digital representations of actual buildings and real-world construction
   processes. However, integrating and applying BIM and simulation modeling
   according to the digital twin concept remains to be fully studied.
   Comprehensive evaluations of BIM, simulation modeling, and digital twin
   will provide a well-defined framework for this research, to identify
   direction and potential for digital twin in the construction industry,
   thereby progressing to the next level of digitalization and improvement
   in construction management practice.},

Abstract = {In an effort to remedy the issue of stagnant labor productivity in the
   construction industry, Building Information Modeling was proposed in the
   late 80's as a new solution for streamlining the design and delivery
   process of construction projects. BIM is a digital representation of a
   building meant to serve all project participants as a repository of all
   relevant data throughout the project's lifecycle. Management of this
   data along with the collaborative nature of BIM has been shown to offer
   many potential benefits to those involved in the project. Despite the
   huge potential for increasing productivity as well as the overall
   efficiency of construction projects, the adoption of BIM throughout the
   industry has been observed as slower than expected. This paper explores
   and analyzes the various barriers hindering the widespread adoption of
   BIM throughout the industry as well as proposes methods for addressing
   them. The author then answers the question of who should be responsible
   for driving the adoption of BIM and how to effectively do it. Finally
   the author proposes areas of further research and development which will
   assist in achieving a more widespread adoption of BIM throughout the
   industry. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {A review of extant literature and recent trends in residential
   construction waste reduction},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 10},
Abstract = {The residential construction sector in New Zealand and worldwide is
   experiencing increased criticism for generating substantial waste that
   poses environmental concerns. Accordingly, researchers have advocated
   implementing residential construction waste reduction (RCWR) strategies
   as a sustainable solution to managing construction waste (CW). This
   article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RCWR by analysing 87
   articles from the Scopus database using bibliometric and critical review
   methods. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed five clusters,
   in which five main themes emerged: (i) waste generation and management
   performance, (ii) prefabrication and life cycle assessment concepts,
   (iii) design concepts, (iv) circular economy and (v) decision-making
   concepts. The findings suggest that sustainable practices such as
   designing for waste reduction, prefabrication, waste quantification,
   three-dimensional printing and building information modelling can
   effectively achieve RCWR. The study also highlights the benefits of
   RCWR, including reducing environmental impacts, and identifies
   management, economic, legislative, technology and cultural barriers that
   affect the implementation of RCWR strategies. These results provide
   valuable insights to support future policy formulation and research
   direction for RCWR in New Zealand.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is a process for managing the
   construction information model. The possibility of managing very complex
   construction orders using information processes has made the work of
   designers both easier and more productive. In this research, a new
   process of ``assisted design{''} was implemented for self-assembling
   temporary houses with high environmental sustainability. The developed
   procedure allows for the supporting of a nonexpert user in the
   configuration of housing modules, using the base elements, and assisting
   them until the energy verification process based on the place of
   installation. Furthermore, a lifecycle assessment of emissions is made
   available. This is the result of the interoperability of software
   enabled by using BIM logic. The proposed work contributes to enriching
   the range of technical solutions developed to meet the demand for
   temporary buildings, providing a valid support tool in the design phase,
   especially when it needs to be completed within a short timeframe. This
   study introduces a smart configuration procedure that combines aspects
   of project automation and flexibility with energy efficiency and
   environmental sustainability needs required for the green transition of
   building stock.},

Title = {Renovation or Redevelopment: The Case of Smart Decision-Support in Aging
   Buildings},
Journal = {SMART CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {In Germany, as in many developed countries, over 60\% of buildings were
   constructed before 1978, where most are in critical condition, requiring
   either demolition with plans for redevelopment or renovation and
   rehabilitation. Given the urgency of climate action and relevant
   sustainable development goals set by the United Nations, more attention
   must be shifted toward the various sustainability aspects when deciding
   on a strategy for the renovation or redevelopment of existing buildings.
   To this end, this study focused on developing a smart decision support
   framework for aging buildings based on lifecycle sustainability
   considerations. The framework integrated digital technological
   advancements, such as building information modeling (BIM), point clouds
   processing with field information modeling (FIM)(R), and structural
   optimization, together with lifecycle assessment to evaluate and rate
   the environmental impact of different solutions. Three sustainability
   aspects, namely, cost, energy consumption, and carbon emissions, were
   quantitatively evaluated and compared in two scenarios, namely,
   renovation, and demolition or deconstruction combined with
   redevelopment. A real building constructed in 1961 was the subject of
   the experiments to validate the framework. The result outlined the
   limitations and advantages of each method in terms of economics and
   sustainability. It was further observed that optimizing the building
   design with the goal of reducing embodied energy and carbon in
   compliance with modern energy standards was crucial to improving overall
   energy performance. This work demonstrated that the BIM-based framework
   developed to assess the environmental impact of rehabilitation work in
   aging buildings can provide effective ratings to guide decision-making
   in real-world projects.},

Title = {Balancing construction and operational carbon emissions: Evaluating

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {94},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Compliance with the global decarbonisation commitments set out in
   Horizon 2050 undoubtedly involves optimising the conditions of the
   housing stock. In this respect, the massive energy renovation of
   obsolete housing blocks in southern EU countries holds the key for the
   achievement of such compliance. This research strives to demonstrate the
   suitability of intervention strategies at district scale. For this
   purpose, an innovative methodology that combines open data, Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS), Urban Energy Modelling (UBEM), and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is proposed and tested in a case study, whilst
   considering several renovation and new-building hypotheses. As an
   innovative approach, this study concurrently analyses greenhouse gas
   emissions arising from both use-related energy consumption (operational
   carbon footprint) and the construction process (embodied carbon
   footprint). This dual perspective provides added value to the results
   obtained, since it offers a more comprehensive representation of
   reality. Based on the results from the LCA and UBEM models, this study
   unveils the entire impact of residential energy use combined with either
   the carbon footprint of energy renovation or that of new buildings. The
   case study analysis reveals that total emissions, encompassing both
   embodied and operational aspects, are lower for retrofitting existing
   buildings when compared to new construction, up to Horizon 2050.
   Remarkably, this preference for renovation persists even as far as 2100.
   The study underscores the critical importance of upgrading the existing
   residential stock in order to achieve the ambitious goal of net-zero
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on data infrastructure that is central to the
   modeling of design and operation of sustainable and healthy buildings.
   While reducing energy consumption by making buildings more energy
   efficient has been touted as an easily obtainable approach to promoting
   carbon-neutral energy societies, the sustainable buildings' benefits and
   impacts on human wellbeing have not been clearly quantified to the
   extent that they may directly influence the decision of adopting
   sustainable building designs. The authors argue that focusing on the
   wellbeing of people occupying the buildings will lead to significant
   changes in the decision-making process of the design and operation of
   sustainable buildings. The authors propose a framework to define the
   type of data that can be measured or acquired and contributed to the
   design and operation of buildings for energy efficiency in relation to
   human wellbeing and social economic aspects. The framework can benefit
   building designers and operators for decision-making using
   wellbeing-centric life cycle assessment. The methodology presented in
   the paper is supported through a case study.},

Abstract = {The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has revolutionized
   the infrastructure construction industry by introducing real-time and
   collaborative information management tools to be used throughout the
   lifecycle of projects. The importance of BIM in this industry has been
   emphasized in previous research. However, strategies for the
   implementation of this system is still less explored, which requires
   more elaboration and validation. The purpose of this paper is to
   investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the
   BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are
   based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case
   study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that
   BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which
   include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and
   sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus
   on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure
   construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2)
   collaboration, and (3) optimization Identification of seven technical
   and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of
   this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into
   technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful
   implementation of the BIM system.},

Abstract = {Wood products are seen globally as an important solution to substitute
   nonrenewable materials in the construction sector to enhance the life
   cycle sustainability of buildings. Globally, the most prominent
   opportunities for sustainability change in housing production lie in
   multistory residential buildings, which are built mainly of concrete,
   steel, and bricks. The possibilities of achieving multiple benefits from
   the use of wood in multistory residential buildings have gained interest
   among scholars, especially in the 2000s. However, the research has been
   dominated by views of production (especially construction processes),
   while scientific knowledge of consumption (especially the occupational
   phase of buildings) remains very limited. Information about how
   consumers with differing views of sustainable consumption evaluate the
   quality of wooden building materials particularly is scarce. This study
   aimed to investigate consumer perceptions of wooden building product
   quality and examine how the perceptions connect with consumers???
   consciousness for sustainable consumption (CSC). The research data were
   gathered in 2018 by a postal survey sent to 1,000 people living in
   Finland (response rate 25.6\%) and analyzed with exploratory factor
   analysis and the Mann-Whitney U test. According to the results,
   respondents??? views of wooden building product quality indicators can
   be grouped into three factors: technical advantages, environmental
   sustainability of materials, and social benefits at home. The strength
   of CSC was found to be linked with respondents??? views of wooden
   building product quality. The results of consumers??? CSC views help
   actors involved in the wood and construction industries better meet
   consumer expectations both for different aspects of sustainability and
   for lifestyles.},

Title = {Coordinated multi-criteria framework for cycling aging-based battery
   storage management strategies for positive building-vehicle system with
   renewable depreciation: Life-cycle based techno-economic feasibility
   study},

Abstract = {The battery-protective control strategy, vehicle-to-building (V2B)
   interactions, and economic policy regarding grid feed-in tariff are
   promising techniques for enhancing the lifecycle-based techno-economic
   performance. However, the current literature indicates limited progress
   in the techno-economic feasibility of positive building-vehicle systems,
   with considerations on battery cycling aging, degradation of hybrid
   renewable generations, and dynamic grid-responsive control strategy. In
   this study, an interactive building-vehicle system was mathematically
   formulated with multidirectional energy interaction paradigms, such as
   building-to-vehicle, grid-to-building, building-to-grid, and
   grid-to-vehicle. The roles of the V2B interaction levels, grid feed-in
   schemes, and energy management strategies in techno-economic
   performances were quantitatively characterised, from the perspectives of
   the net present value (NPV), discounted payback time (DPT), and net
   direct energy consumption. Novel energy management strategies were
   proposed for battery relative capacity improvement in response to the
   dynamic renewable-demand signal and grid information. Furthermore,
   uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed on the renewable
   system cost, battery cost, interest rate, and escalation rate of the
   electricity price. The results indicated that the ignorance of battery
   cycling aging results in an overestimation on NPV from 2.404 x 10(8)
   (0.310 x 10(8) US\$) to 3.005 x 10(8) HK\$ (0.388 x 10(8) US\$).
   Furthermore, compared to traditional rough estimation on battery aging
   (with the NPV at 2.446 x 10(8) HK\$ and the DPT at 4 years), the dynamic
   model in this study can provide more accurate and reliable battery
   relative capacity, together with conservative assessment on
   techno-economic feasibility (the NPV at 1.860 x 108 HK\$ (0.240 x 10(8)
   US\$) and the DPT at 5 years). In comparison with the grid feed-in
   tariff policies in most European countries, the implementation of the
   latest grid feed-in tariff in Hong Kong can increase the NPV from -7.633
   x 107 (-0.985 x 10(8) US\$) to 2.303 x 10(8) HK\$ (0.297 x 10(8) US\$)
   for the positive building-vehicle system. An interactive
   building-vehicle system was formulated, together with advanced
   management strategies for lifecycle-based techno-economic performance
   enhancement. Comparative analyses among scenarios with different control
   strategies, V2B interaction levels, and grid feed-in tariff schemes were
   performed to verify the reliability of the proposed technique for
   positive building-vehicle systems.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the general strategies of building an expert
   system for generating the Hot Strip Mill (HSM) rolling schedules. One
   major goal of this system is to automatically generate schedules which
   contain a list of slab sequence for each different rolling cycle. The
   input source to the system is the available slabs in the storage yard.
   This information is first downloaded from the EDP HSM control file.
   After process, this system then outputs various rolling schedules which
   satisfy the specific requirements and constraints, and provide an
   optimal cost effective result. Several user selective menus plus a
   graphic dynamic display pattern have provided very friendly user
   environment. The entire system has been implemented in the NEXPERT
   Object Development tool. The Linear Model of the expert system life
   cycle has been adopted to guide the entire process which consists of a
   number of stages from Planning to System Evaluation. It also describes
   the development of the system to some point at which its functional
   capabilities can be evaluated.},

Title = {A theoretical BIM-based framework for quantity take-off to facilitate
   progress payments: the case of high-rise building projects in Vietnam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},

Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to provide an integrated BIM-based approach for
   quantity take-off for progress payments in the context of high-rise
   buildings in Vietnam. It tries to find answers for the following
   questions: (1) When to start the QTO processes to facilitate the
   contract progress payments? (2) What information is required to measure
   the quantity of works to estimate contract progress payment (3) What are
   the challenges to manage (i.e. create, store, update and exploit)? What
   are the required information for this BIM use? and (4) How to process
   the information to deliver BIM-based QTO to facilitate contract progress
   payment? Design/methodology/approach The paper applied a deductive
   approach and expert consensus through a Delphi procedure to adapt to
   current innovation around BIM-based QTO. Starting with a literature
   review, it then discusses current practices in BIM-based QTO in general
   and high-rise building projects in particular. Challenges were compiled
   from the previous studies for references for BIM-based QTO to facilitate
   contract progress payment for high-rise building projects in Vietnam. A
   framework was developed considering a standard information management
   process throughout the construction lifecycle, when the BIM use of this
   study is delivered. The framework was validated with Delphi technique.
   Findings Four major challenges for BIM-based QTO discovered: new types
   of information required for the BIM model, changes and updates as
   projects progress, low interoperability between BIM model and estimation
   software, potentiality of low productivity and accuracy in data entry.
   Required information for QTO to facilitate progress payments in
   high-rise building projects include Object Geometric/Appearance
   Information, Structural Components' Definition and Contextual
   Information. Trade-offs between ``Speed - Level of Detail-Applicable
   Breadth{''} and ``Quality - Productivity{''} are proposed to consider
   the information amount to input at a time when creating/updating BIM
   objects. Interoperability check needed for creating, authoring/updating
   processing the BIM model's objects. Research limitations/implications
   This paper is not flawless. The first limitation lies in that the
   theoretical framework was established only based on desk research and
   small number of expert judgment. Further primary data collection would
   be needed to determine exactly how the framework underlies widespread
   practices. Secondly, this study only discussed the quantity take-off
   specifically for contract progress payment, but not for other purposes
   or broader BIM uses. Further research in this field would be of great
   help in developing a standard protocol for automatic quantity surveying
   system in Vietnam. Originality/value A new theoretical framework for
   BIM-based QTO validated with Delphi technique to facilitate progress
   payments for high-rise building projects, considering all information
   management stages and the phases of information development in the
   project lifecycle. The framework identified four types of information
   required for this QTO, detailed considerations for strategies (Library
   Objects Development, BIM Objects Information Declaration, BIM-based QTO)
   for better managing the information for this BIM use. Two trade-offs of
   ``Speed - LOD-Applicable Breadth{''} and ``Quality - Productivity{''}
   have been proposed for facilitating the strategies and also for
   enhancing the total efficiency and effectiveness of the QTO process.},

Title = {Component-Based Model for Building Material Stock and Waste-Flow
   Characterization: A Case in the ile-de-France Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Building demolition is one of the main sources of waste generation in
   urban areas and is a growing problem for cities due to the generated
   environmental impacts. To promote high levels of circular economy, it is
   necessary to better understand the waste-flow composition; nevertheless,
   material flow studies typically focus on low levels of detail. This
   article presents a model based on a bottom-up macro-component approach,
   which allows the multiscale characterization of construction materials
   and the estimation of demolition waste flows, a model that we call the
   BTP-flux model. Data mining, analytical techniques, and geographic
   information system (GIS) tools were used to assess different datasets
   available at the national level and develop a common database for French
   buildings: BDNB. Generic information for buildings in the BDNB is then
   enriched by coupling every building with a catalog of macro-components
   (TyPy), thus allowing the building's physical description. Subsequently,
   stock and demolition flows are calculated by aggregation and classified
   into 32 waste categories. The BTP-flux model was applied in
   ile-de-France in a sample of 101,320 buildings for residential and
   non-residential uses, representative of the assessed population
   (1,968,242 buildings). In the case of ile-de-France, the building stock
   and the total demolition flows were estimated at 1382 Mt and 4065 kt,
   respectively. For its inter-regional areas-departments-, stock and
   demolition waste can vary between 85 and 138 tons/cap and 0.263 and
   0.486 tons/cap/year, respectively. The mean of the total demolition
   wastes was estimated at 0.33 tons/cap/year for the region. Results could
   encourage scientists, planners, and stakeholders to develop pathways
   towards a circular economy in the construction sector by implementing
   strategies for better management of waste recovery and reintegrating in
   economic circuits, while preserving a maximum of their added value.},

   households is a significant problem. Hence, it is necessary to formulate
   a long-term policy on the use of long-life and highly-insulating
   technologies for houses; these technologies are expected to reduce CO,
   emission. The conventional LCA methodology can evaluate the
   environmental impact of these technologies, while not necessarily
   providing sufficient information to support policy-making because of its
   analytical perspective. The aim of the present study is to first develop
   a new methodology to examine the optimal use of technologies to
   formulate an environmental policy by considering dynamic socioeconomic
   conditions. Second, as a demonstration, such a developed methodology is
   applied to explore an environmentally conscious housing policy for CO,
   abatement in Japan.
   Methods. A new methodology was developed, considering the context of a
   society where technologies are introduced, in order to determine the
   optimal configuration of technologies to minimize the cumulative
   environmental burden over time on a social scale. An inter-temporal
   linear programming model using an input-output table was formulated to
   make the methodology operational. Using the new model, the optimal use
   of long-life and thermal-insulating technologies for houses is examined
   to minimize CO, emissions across the entire life cycle of all the houses
   in Japan.
   Results and Discussion. The results of the model simulation indicate
   that not only long-life and highly-insulating technologies, but also
   short-life and poorly-insulating technologies, are required to minimize
   CO, emissions over a long period. According to the conventional LCA, a
   house with a short life is inferior to that with a long life, and a
   house with poor insulation is inferior to that with high insulation.
   However, houses with a short life and/or poor insulation are introduced
   in a transition phase to a certain extent before the final stage is
   reached that is completely dominated by highly-insulated houses with a
   long life. In other words, the existing houses that were built in the
   past are gradually replaced with highly-insulated houses with a long
   life after first building houses with a short life and/or poor
   insulation. It is not always feasible or not necessarily an optimal
   solution on a social scale to introduce only a technology that is best
   evaluated by using the conventional LCA. Inferior technologies can also
   play a significant role because of various socio-economic conditions and
   requirements, e.g. population decline, limited housing budgets, and
   employment stability. Dynamic socio-economic conditions significantly
   influence the optimal mix of technologies for CO, minimization in the
   entire society.
   Conclusions and Recommendations. The present study suggests that it is
   critical to consider dynamic socio-economic conditions when examining
   technologies for selection with the aim of a long-term reduction of the
   environmental burden. The new methodology proposed can provide valuable
   information to support policy-making toward a sustainable society.},

Abstract = {One of today's grand societal challenges is to replace the current
   `take-make-waste' economic model with a circular economic model that
   allows a gradual decoupling of economic activities from the consumption
   of finite virgin resources. While circular economy (CE) scholars have
   long lauded digital technologies such as sensors, distributed ledgers,
   or platforms as key enablers, our own community has not fully explored
   the potentials of information systems (IS) for a CE. Considering recent
   technological advances in software and hardware and our history of
   helping address wicked challenges, we believe the time is ripe to
   mobilise IS scholarship for a CE. Our findings from an interdisciplinary
   literature review show that research has primarily examined IS
   potentials for increasing efficiency of isolated intra-organisational
   processes while neglecting the larger sustainability potential of IS to
   establish circular material flows-that is, slow down and close material
   loops across entire product lifecycles. In response, we propose
   directions for IS research that develop our knowledge of how IS can help
   understand and enact circular material flows to intensify and extend use
   of products and components and recycle waste materials. Our directions
   offer pathways to building and evaluating the problem-solution pairing
   that could characterise a prolific CE-IS relationship.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) in the design and
   construction phases of building projects has increased considerably in
   recent years; however, its use in postconstruction is still lagging.
   Much of this is because of the lack of experience by owner organizations
   in using BIM during operations and maintenance (O\&M). The architecture,
   engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry is undergoing
   a major paradigm shift that will require building owners to develop
   lifecycle-oriented BIM strategies. Consequently, owners will play a
   vital role in improving the maturity of future BIM-assisted projects
   through their requirements documentation, assessment of the quality and
   accuracy of BIM deliverables, and continued application of BIM during
   facilities management (FM). The primary objective of this research study
   was to develop a framework for building owner organizations to use in
   the assessment of their BIM competency. Using the Delphi technique, 66
   critical factors that are influential in the evaluation of owners' BIM
   competency were identified and prioritized on the basis of the
   perceptions of 21 prequalified BIM experts. The data derived from the
   Delphi phase were then used to propose an assessment tool that allows
   owners to evaluate their operations across three diverse competency
   areas and 12 specifically tailored competency categories. These
   evaluations can then be used by owners to assess and expand their
   technical knowledge, improve their current BIM requirements, and
   increase the efficiency of their postconstruction operations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Modelling and standardisation for railway infrastructure has attracted
   the attention from both academia and industry for a long time. Building
   Information modelling (BIM) derived from the area of building
   construction and is currently on the rise in infrastructure projects.
   However, in the domain of railway infrastructure, BIM is not advanced
   enough for productive use due to the lack of the railway specific
   requirements. In order to propose an effective modelling and
   standardisation technique for railway infrastructure, International
   Union of Railway (UIC) leads the RailTopoModel project. The
   RailTopoModel intends to be used in all business processes dealing with
   the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the railway
   infrastructure. The paper presents the details of RailTopoModel with one
   case study based on a railway network. The new dimension for the further
   development of RailTopoModel in the context of Product Lifecycle
   Management (PLM) is then presented. Finally, the implementation of the
   RailTopoModel and its new dimension into the PLM numerical platform is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The importance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in construction
   and facility operation is unquestionable, but there is a clear
   discrepancy between the data included in as-built BIM models and the
   expected use specified by customers. This disparity presents significant
   obstacles in properly using BIM for facility management and operational
   operations. The main goal of this research is to suggest inventive and
   pragmatic approaches that successfully address the discrepancy between
   the actual BIM model data, with a specific emphasis on COBie dataset,
   and the intended BIM applications outlined by stakeholders in the
   Employer's Information Requirement (EIR) for facility management and
   operation. The study methodology is based on a comprehensive examination
   of current literature, demo case studies, as well as standards
   pertaining to BIM data, COBie.Type, and EIR requirements. The results of
   this study consist of a collection of standards, procedures, and
   suggested practices specifically designed to improve the utilization of
   as-built BIM model data for facility management and operation. These
   will closely correlate with the BIM applications stated by the client.
   Furthermore, the project seeks to enhance industry norms and practices,
   promoting enhanced cooperation and information sharing among
   stakeholders. This research has also investigated the efficiency of
   Solibri Model Checker (SMC) to validate the COBie type and component
   information provided by COBie.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Construction industry has become more interested in designing and
   constructing environmentally friendly buildings that can provide both
   high performance and monetary savings. Generally, the sustainability
   analysis is mostly conducted at the end of the design stage, once their
   components and elements have already been selected. However, achieving
   an integrated sustainable design solution prior to construction means
   that the design team must manage reciprocal task interdependencies when
   making decisions related to the selection of the most suitable design
   alternative that will lead to sustainable and efficient buildings. This
   study describes a methodology to automate the process sustainability
   assessment for proposed buildings by integrating Building Information
   Model (BIM) and LEED certification system while providing a framework to
   calculate the credits that building could potentially earn at the
   conceptual stage. This research aims to propose an integrated
   methodology that links BIM with green building certification systems at
   the early design stage of a project's life. A plug-in is developed to
   calculate and predict the potential accumulated LEED credits with access
   to the Application Program Interface (API) of the BIM tool, energy
   analysis and lighting simulation tool, Google Map and their associated
   library. The plug-in uses K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) data mining method
   to estimate the missing credits, which could not be calculated directly
   from design specifications, to propose the whole scale innovative green
   building evaluation interface for building projects.},

Abstract = {During the previous two decades, the energy saving potential using
   systematic building management is considered to be important which
   should be considered through the building lifecycle. Among the wide
   range types of different buildings, Public buildings are considered as
   one of the biggest energy-consuming sector in the world and major part
   of this amount is used by the air conditioning system especially in
   tropical climates. The most effective decisions related to sustainable
   design of a building facility are made in the feasibility and early
   design stages. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can expedite this
   process and provide the opportunity of testing and assessing different
   design alternatives and materials selection that may impact on energy
   performance of buildings. This paper aims at evaluating the efficiency
   of various types of wall materials with regard to theirs properties on
   energy saving. The case study in this paper is modeled by means of BIM
   application and then simulated by software, which is appropriate for
   energy analysis. The current energy consumption patterns of this case
   identified and shifted to the optimized level of energy usages by
   changing the walls materials to find most optimized of walls materials.
   Modification most optimized wall materials and energy analysis indicated
   9347 Wh in Per meter square of electrical energy saving. (C) 2016

   Continuous efforts have been undertaken regarding the development of
   standardized specifications based on the IFC, a product model used in
   the AEC/FM industries. In accordance, the XM-4 project has been
   initiated by the Korea Chapter of the International Alliance for
   Interoperability (IAI) organizations to develop a two-dimensional (2D)
   extension model for IFC. The XM-4 project aims to add to the IFC2x
   platform the ability to exchange 2D computer-aided design data within
   representations of virtual building models, including annotations and
   styles mainly adapted from the ISO 10303. The focus of this research has
   been on developing a 2D extension model for the IFC as part of the IAI
   XM-4 project. This paper provides the scope and rationale of the model
   extension, major modeling concepts, defined high-level entities and
   row-level entities, and implementation issues to be considered.},

Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC/FM) industry deals with the design, construction, and operation of
   complex buildings. Today, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used to
   represent information about a building in a single, non-redundant
   representation. Here, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)
   can improve the visualization and interaction with the resulting model
   by augmenting the real world with information from the BIM model or
   allowing a user to immerse in a virtual world generated from the BIM
   model. This can improve the design, construction, and operation of
   buildings. While an increasing number of studies in HCI, construction,
   or engineering have shown the potential of using AR and VR technology
   together with BIM, often research remains focused on individual
   explorations and key design strategies. In addition to that, a
   systematic overview and discussion of recent works combining AR/VR with
   BIM are not yet fully covered. Therefore, this paper systematically
   reviews recent approaches combining AR/VR with BIM and categorizes the
   literature by the building's lifecycle phase while systematically
   describing relevant use cases. In total, 32 out of 447 papers between
   2017 and 2022 were categorized. The categorization shows that most
   approaches focus on the construction phase and the use case of review
   and quality assurance. In the design phase, most approaches use VR,
   while in the construction and operation phases, AR is prevalent.},

Title = {Spoken dialogue BIM systems - an application of big data in construction},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {13-14, SI},
Pages = {787-800},
Abstract = {Purpose - With the rapid development in the internet technologies, the
   applications of big data in construction have seen considerable
   attention. Currently, there are many input/output modes of capturing
   construction knowledge related to all construction stages. On the other
   hand, building information modelling (BIM) systems have been developed
   to help in storing various structured data of buildings. However, these
   systems cannot fully capture the knowledge and unstructured data used in
   the operation of building systems in a usable format that uses the
   intelligent capabilities of BIM systems. Therefore, this research aims
   to adopt the concept of big data and develop a spoken dialogue BIM
   system to capture buildings operation knowledge, particularly for
   building maintenance and refurbishment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system integrates cloud-based
   spoken dialogue systemand case-based reasoning BIM system.
   Findings - The system acts as an interactive expert agent that seeks
   answers from the user for questions specific to building maintenance
   problems and helps searching for solutions from previously stored
   knowledge cases. The practices of monitoring and maintaining buildings
   performance can be more efficient by the retrieval of relevant solutions
   from the captured knowledge to new problems when maintaining buildings
   components. The developed system enables easier capture and search for
   solutions to new problems with a more comprehensive retrieval of
   information.
   Originality/value - Capturing multi-modes data into BIM systems using
   the cloud-based spoken dialogue systems will help construction teams use
   the high volume of data generated over building lifecycle and search for
   the most suitable solutions for maintenance problems. This new area of
   research also contributes to the current BIM systems by advancing their
   capabilities to instantly capture and retrieve knowledge of operations
   instead of only information.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, building information modelling (BIM) has emerged as
   one of the most powerful dynamic decision-making tools throughout a
   project lifecycle, as its encapsulated information synchronises with
   construction practices. Many reports indicate that BIM has entered the
   mainstream use in some countries. However, BIM has experienced slow and
   limited spread adoption in other countries. We propose a comprehensive
   research model to examine the factors that influence the adoption of
   BIM. The model draws on technology acceptance model and innovation
   diffusion theory and is validated using survey data from the
   construction industry in China. The findings demonstrate that attitude,
   technological, and organisational dimensions indirectly affect the
   actual use of BIM through perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease
   of use (PEU), with PU and PEU being the primary determinants of BIM
   adoption. Furthermore, a striking finding was the positive influence of
   the attitude dimension on the actual use of BIM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {499-522},
Abstract = {Currently, 2D-based analogue building subdivision plans are used to
   represent the spatial extent of private, public and communal property
   ownership rights. These plans are recognized as posing a range of
   challenges in terms of communicating the spatial complexity of ownership
   spaces within multi-storey buildings. In response to these challenges,
   three-dimensional (3D) digital data environments are being investigated
   as a potential approach for managing complex, vertically stratified
   ownership arrangements. The argument presented in this article is that
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) can be adopted for 3D digital
   management of data related to complex ownership spaces. BIM provides a
   common and 3D digital data sharing space, underpinning a reliable basis
   for facilitating collaboration and decision-making over the lifecycle of
   buildings. However, ownership attributes and the spatial structure of
   ownership arrangements inside buildings are yet to be accommodated
   within the BIM data environment. In this article, we present a range of
   required data elements for managing complex ownership spaces, which have
   been elicited by investigating current practices pertaining to
   subdivision of ownership spaces within multi-storey buildings in
   Melbourne, Australia. An open data model in the BIM domain is extended
   with these data elements and a prototype model for a real multi-storey
   building is implemented to demonstrate the viability of the extended
   data model for 3D digital management and visualization of data related
   to complex ownership arrangements.},

Abstract = {The Building Envelope Life Cycle Asset Management (BELCAM) project, lead
   by the National Research Council Canada (NRCC) and Public Works and
   Government Service Canada (PWGSC), is a ``proof of concept{''} project
   aimed at helping asset managers to predict the remaining service life of
   building envelope components and to maximize the return on their
   maintenance expenditure. The BELCAM project focuses on flat or low-slope
   conventional roofing systems as a representative domain. This paper
   focuses on maintenance management, which is primarily concerned with the
   management of all technical and administrative tasks involved in
   maintaining a building element in, or restoring it to, a state in which
   it can perform its intended function. A framework for the integration of
   the process of managing maintenance of roofing systems is proposed. The
   framework consists of five sequential steps: (1) Identification of
   roofing system components requiring assessment, (2) Identification of
   roofing system performance requirements, (3) Identification of
   performance assessment methods, (4) Roofing system maintenance planning,
   (5) Roofing system maintenance operations management. This paper
   introduces a framework for roofing systems maintenance management. It
   presents a preliminary analysis of an integrated information system to
   support maintenance management. The paper follows the development
   methodology adopted by the International Alliance for Interoperability
   (LAI) to represent the high-level information within the proposed
   framework of maintenance management. IAI projects follow a standard
   process-oriented development methodology, involving the following steps:
   usage scenarios, process definitions, information analysis and
   information modeling and validation.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper explores the notion of the modular building construction site
   as an applied instance of redistributed manufacturing; in so doing, this
   research seeks to reduce the environmental footprint of building sites,
   treating them as small digitally connected subunits. In seeking to
   provide a whole lifecycle appreciation of a construction project, it is
   noted that the presence of a framework to provide guidance on the
   consideration of Internet of Things (IoT) data streams and connected
   construction objects is currently lacking. This paper proposes use of
   embedded IoT enabled sensing technology within all stages of a modular
   building lifecycle. An expanded four-phase model of intelligent assets
   use in construction is proposed along with an outline of the required
   data flows between the stages of a given building's entire lifecycle
   that need to be facilitated for a BIM (Buildings Information Modelling)
   representation to begin to describe a building project as a sustainable
   asset within the circular economy. This paper also describes the use of
   concrete as a modular sensing structure; proposing that health
   monitoring of the material in situ along with the recoding of
   environmental factors over time could help to extend the longevity of
   such structures.},

Title = {Identifying the Most Efficient Natural Fibre for Common Commercial
   Building Insulation Materials with an Integrated PSI, MEREC, LOPCOW and
   MCRAT Model},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Abstract = {Building insulation is the most respected among the compatible and
   effective energy conservation technologies available today, as it also
   reduces yearly energy costs and negative environmental effects. A
   building envelope is made up of various insulation materials that are
   important in determining a building's thermal performance. Proper
   insulation material selection concludes in less energy requisition for
   operation. The purpose of this research is to supply information about
   natural fibre insulating materials used in construction insulation to
   maintain energy efficiency, as well as to recommend the most efficient
   natural fibre insulation material. As in most decision-making problems,
   several criteria and alternatives are involved in insulation material
   selection, too. Therefore, we used a novel integrated multi criteria
   decision making (MCDM) model including the preference selection index
   (PSI), method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC),
   logarithmic percentage change-driven objective weighting (LOPCOW), and
   multiple criteria ranking by alternative trace (MCRAT) methods to deal
   with the complexity of numerous criteria and alternatives. The
   contribution of this study is that a new hybrid MCDM method is
   developed. Additionally, the number of studies using the MCRAT method is
   very limited in the literature; therefore, this study will provide more
   insights into and results of this method to the literature.},

Abstract = {This article presents the research work done in order to reduce the gap
   of heterogeneity between Geographic Information System and Building
   Information Models. The goal is to extend a platform dedicated to
   facility management called ACTIVe3D. We want to enlarge its scope to
   take into account the management of urban elements contained in the
   building environment, as well as other buildings. The particularity of
   the platform is that data can be accessed either by a semantic view or
   through a 3D interface. The SIGA3D project describes a set of processes
   that aims, for all the stakeholders of urban projects, to manage pieces
   of information through all the lifecycle of construction projects. To
   solve the heterogeneity problem between BIM and GIS, we developed a
   semantic extension to the BIM called UIM (Urban Information Modeling).
   This extension defines spatial, temporal and multi-representation
   concepts to build an extensible ontology. The knowledge database can be
   populated with information coming from standards like IFC and CityGML.
   This information system has been adapted and implemented into the
   existing platform and is today fully operational and used by thousands
   of users. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The construction industry in comparison to other industries has achieved
   less productivity and effectivity during the last few decades. Lean
   construction philosophy, integrated project delivery method and recently
   building information modeling technologies helped raising the
   productivity and effectivity of the construction industry by introducing
   new and improved processes. Adopting and implementing building
   information modeling provides accurate digital information to undertake
   efficient and effective planning and execution of the complex
   construction projects. Today, use of building information modeling in
   architecture, engineering, and construction industries has been
   institutionalized insofar as some developed countries developed their
   building information modeling guidelines and instructions. It is
   believed that building information modeling as a mighty conceptual
   strategy could be implemented in the lifecycle of nonbuilding projects,
   too. To steer the researchers and practitioners' in that direction, the
   current article aims to explain capabilities of building information
   modeling when used for nonbuilding projects especially in the process
   plants and the oil, gas, and petrochemical projects. To achieve the
   mentioned goals, a widespread literature survey on adopting and
   implementing building information modeling in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industry lifecycle including the benefits,
   barriers, and challenges, as well as expert interviews with oil, gas,
   and petrochemical industry firms were conducted. Finally, challenges and
   prerequisites that should be addressed before getting the full benefits
   of building information modeling in the oil, gas, and petrochemical
   industry are highlighted.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a web-based platform called ACTIVe3D BUILD
   SERVER. This platform lets geographically dispersed project
   participants-from architects to electricians-directly use and exchange
   project documents in a centralized virtual environment during the life
   cycle of a civil engineering project. This platform is based on IFC
   which associate in the same model the semantic and the 3D representation
   of business objects which describes a building. IFC files are textual
   files whose size can reach 100 megabytes. The elements defined in these
   files are organized in cyclic and hierarchical graphs generated from
   various civil engineering contexts. Due to their structure and their
   size, their handling and sharing is a complex task. We propose a method
   to analyze and restructure IFC instances as a set Of XML trees. This
   reorganization is related to the analysis of the various contexts
   present in IFC files. This representation in the shape of tree allows
   the actors of a project to exchange partial IFC files by extracting IFC
   elements from a specific context, to merge various partial IFC files
   into only one and to store the knowledge of the building into IFC tables
   managed by a relational DBMS. Some trees are used to dynamically
   construct 3D scenes which lets participants move around in the building
   being designed and obtain information about the objects that compose it.},

Title = {Lifecycle Exchange for Asset Data (LEAD) A proposed process model for
   managing asset dataflow between building stakeholders using BIM open
   standards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Pages = {385-411},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to outline the problems
   associated with asset information management using the Construction
   Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) standard and to analyse
   the causes of industry failure to successfully adopt the standard. Based
   on this analysis, the paper will propose a process model, namely,
   Lifecycle Exchange of Asset Data (LEAD) to manage asset dataflow between
   all building stakeholders from design to construction and ultimately to
   the facility management team. This model aims to help the construction
   supply chain to produce complete and high-quality asset data that
   supports the operation phase of the built environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of relevant studies provided a
   theoretical background for this study. The authors then collected and
   analysed COBie data from five live construction projects using building
   information modelling (BIM) projects from different design and
   construction companies. The process model is based on an industry
   placement within Bouygues UK construction company, which was a Tier 1
   building contractor in London in the period from December 2016 to
   December 2018. The researcher used an inductive approach observing
   current practises in two construction projects to produce ``LEAD{''}
   model. Then a focus group was conducted with industry experts to discuss
   and refine the process model.
   Findings - Analysis of literature and data collected in the course of
   this study revealed that although COBie is a BIM Level 2 standard in the
   UK, there is currently a low success rate in producing complete and
   accurate COBie data in the UK construction industry. This low rate is
   because of COBie's rigid data syntax/structure, complexity and ambiguity
   of its data exchange process, which suggests that COBie may not be the
   future of the industry. Based on these findings, the study proposed a
   process model, namely, ``LEAD,{''} to improve COBie output and also to
   be used with project-specific information requirements.
   Practical implications - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
   paper is one of the first to focus solely on asset data exchange process
   using COBie standard and highlights the problems the industry faces in
   this remit. The study is based on industry placement for two years, so
   the analysis is based on actual and current industry problems. Current
   industry practices also informed the ``LEAD{''} model, and the model
   provides a step-by-step guidance in producing and exchanging BIM asset
   data in all stages of the building lifecycle.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a detailed analysis of the most
   common problems associated with COBie as an asset data exchange
   standard. Understanding these problems is of high value for industry
   practitioners to avoid them in projects. The paper also proposed a novel
   process model that can be used either to improve COBie quality or can be
   used with any project-specific data requirements.},

Title = {Dynamic Capabilities in Cybersecurity Intelligence: A Meta-Synthesis to
   Enhance Protection Against Cyber Threats},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {Advanced cybersecurity threats with automated capabilities are on the
   rise in industries such as finance, healthcare, technology, retail,
   telecoms, and transportation, as well as government. It is necessary to
   conduct analyses of cybersecurity-related resources and capabilities to
   build cybersecurity intelligence (CI). The purpose of this paper is to
   suggest a dynamic capability in a cybersecurity intelligence (DCCI)
   model based on existing literature that helped firms reduce risks of
   cyber violations and advance the development of systems and the life
   cycle of firms. Through a meta-synthesis, an abduction and induction
   approach through eight methodological steps analyzed in forty-seven case
   studies the presence of cybersecurity capabilities to build CI.
   Combining theoretical and practical information security maturity models
   as a foundation, we understand capabilities building to improve the
   predictability of cyber incidents. The results evidenced four
   second-order dimensions to build CI named doing, enabling, improving,
   and managing cybersecurity, and eight first-order outcomes to represent
   the DCCI model. This research makes an unprecedented contribution to
   international and national scenarios, as it will allow firms to innovate
   their resource management processes and abilities to enable better
   cybersecurity projects and reduce the impacts of potential cyberattacks
   with the probability of eradicating vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Visualization is one of the main features of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM). It has many advantages throughout the lifecycle of a
   construction project, and it has become a timely research topic in
   recent years. However, no attempt has been made to give a holistic
   understanding of the existing BIM-based visualization research status.
   Thus, this study aims to conduct a scientometric analysis of the
   existing BIM-based visualization literature and to gain a snapshot of
   the research status during the period 2010-2019. A total of 255 articles
   were abstracted from the Scopus database. Then, the VOSviewer program
   was employed to visualize the research status from the perspectives of
   scholars, countries/regions, journals, articles, and co-occurring
   keywords. Results revealed that Wang X. published the greatest number of
   articles, while Cheng J.C.P. received the greatest average normalized
   citations. Furthermore, Automation in Construction was identified as the
   most influential journal and the article Building information modeling
   (BIM): trends, benefits, risks, and challenges for the AEC industry was
   the most cited paper. Through the keywords co-occurrence analysis,
   virtual reality and visual programming language were identified as the
   emerging themes in this field. The research findings can provide both
   researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the status
   quo and trends of the BIM-based visualization research.},

Title = {Assessment the technical and economic performance of a window-integrated
   PV system using third-generation PV panels},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {To reduce the energy consumption of buildings by installing PV panels
   therein, it is important to accu-rately predict the technical and
   economic performance of the PV panels to be installed and to determine
   whether their installation will result in profits. In this study, a
   window-integrated PV system was pro-posed that combines the exterior
   window of a building with PV panels, and its technical and economic
   performance was analyzed. To this end, a residential building in Seoul,
   the most populous area in South Korea, was used as a reference model,
   and third-generation PV panels were analyzed. The main findings are as
   follows. First, with respect to the technical performance of the PV
   panels, the window -integrated OPV system installed in household type B
   generated the most annual electricity (923.34kWh). However, the
   window-integrated OPV system installed in household type C generated the
   most annual electricity per unit area (36.64 kWh/m2). Second, the NPV20
   and SIR20 increased as the household's monthly electricity consumption
   increased and the closer to the south the orientation of the PV panel
   was. These results show that the window-integrated PV system that used
   the third -generation PV panel is expected to be one of the active
   strategies for achieving net-zero-energy buildings.(c) 2023 Elsevier

Abstract = {The State Grid Corporation of China proposed the idea of building a
   ubiquitous power Internet of Things, which intends to endow the power
   system with adjustable perceptivity through the Internet of Things
   technology. Aiming at the power system under the Internet of Things,
   this article propounds a framework for the construction and intelligent
   assessment of the knowledge graph (KG). First of all, the introduction
   of the power Internet of Things system architecture and data life cycle
   will be introduced from the aspects of organisational structure,
   management system, team building, technical support and data security
   protection. Then, the key information is mined from the complicated
   physical text data of the power grid by using NLP technology. At the
   same time, a hybrid model is propounded for named entity recognition,
   which effectively uses context information to meliorate the accuracy of
   extraction. The experimental results evince that the accuracy rate of
   the Internet-based grid physical data KG construction and intelligent
   analysis framework proposed in article reaches 96.53\%. It is a new
   guidance for the research and evolution of future power grid objects.},

Abstract = {Today in Europe building-sector is responsible for the 50\% of air
   pollution and for 70\% of waste production. For this reason,
   researchers' interest is focused on new eco-building materials that are
   sustainable, with low impact, renewable and recyclable. In this context,
   in the last few years, the use of cellulose-based fibres as potential
   reinforcements for bio-composite materials, instead of synthetic one,
   received worldwide growing attention. Among natural fibres, both
   cellulose and protein-based ones, in literature it was found that, due
   to its mechanical properties, artichoke fibre is suitable for this use.
   In this study, a Geographical Information System (GIS) - based model to
   locate and quantify the yearly amount of agricultural waste coming from
   Cynara cardunculus L. (CW) cultivation was put forward and was applied
   in a study area located in Southern Italy. As an additional
   protein-based fibre, sheep wool fibre was also taken into account due to
   the high presence of sheep. The estimated available amount of both
   considered fibres was reported in a GIS map in order to show their
   distribution at territorial level. The achieved results could represent
   basic information for both sustainable locating collection centre and
   analysing the environmental impact related to the logistics and supply

Abstract = {One of the main problems of the inventory of architectural heritage is
   managing and storing large amounts of information in different formats,
   in addition to the need to organize and manage the information generated
   by collaborative work between the different technicians who participate
   in the documentation process. The solution involves the development of a
   model capable of incorporating information on a layered support and
   allowing analysis and management, as well as interoperability between
   tools and other systems throughout the entire life cycle of the
   building. To carry out this work, two methodologies have been selected
   to verify their effectiveness in the field of architectural heritage
   inventory, covering the specific needs of generating a complete graphic
   database of the building. The Arches platform, a free open source
   software developed to carry out inventories, has been chosen for its
   interoperability, specificity and all the characteristics and functions
   described above. In turn, a WebGIS has been developed using free
   software standards and technology, to examine the possibilities it
   offers in relation to specific inventory programs. As a result, the
   creation of an Information System of the Mudejar Architectural Heritage
   of Aragon has been proposed, with the purpose of integrating under a
   common support, all the documentation and graphic information available
   on the heritage asset. The research limitations are the creation of a
   geo-referenced database, with geometric information on each building,
   which addresses the cataloguing of more than 200 assets, due to the
   uniqueness of this architectural style. The information is stored
   complying with the documentation standards to ensure interoperability
   and accessibility to the data.},

Abstract = {It is apparent that the development or implementation of a collaborative
   product development management (CPDM) system in an enterprise should be
   based on the right understanding of core domain objects, their main
   attributes, and their relationships to other objects in the product
   development domain. For this purpose, an object-oriented conceptual
   model of a CPDM system based on a top-down approach is presented in this
   paper. For building the conceptual model systematically, this paper
   proposes the 4P2C modeling views, which are multi-faceted views of
   engineering information that provides an integrated and consistent
   perspective on engineering information. The 4P2C stands for product,
   process, project, participant, cost, and collaboration. Based on the
   4P2C modeling views, six sub-models are constructed that eventually
   constitute a complete conceptual CPDM model. In each sub-model, the
   decomposition of core domain objects, their main attributes, and their
   relationships to other objects are represented in detail. A prototype
   application program along with an illustrative cost calculation example
   is also presented to demonstrate that the proposed CPDM model will
   enable enterprises to maintain consistency in product data efficiently
   throughout the product life cycle.},

Abstract = {With the new technology of creating building design, many changes of
   traditional processes have to be set in order to reach project
   documentation and project design itself in higher quality level. As a
   traditional project documentation is changing in ``digital twin{''} of
   building work, the way of building work design changes too. Building
   design and project documentation do not serve only for the building
   construction, maintenance and operation. Project documentation is the
   output, also the input - both at the same time - in connection with
   further building legislation, landscape planning, etc. BIM model,
   nowadays the highest quality of project documentation, should
   communicate with many related registers. Important basic information is
   as an input for the project design, afterwards information from the
   project design should be reflected as an output for the enlisting in
   related registers. Due to the absence of efficient digitization of the
   construction industry, the relevancy, correctness and reliability of
   information in the related registers is not very high in the Czech
   Republic, at this time. Digitization of construction industry and
   implementation of BIM technology promises many benefits. The magnitude
   of these benefits depends on how the data exchange is modified in the
   construction process during the whole building lifecycle. This paper
   reveals possibilities of basic principles of the new way of design using
   BIM technology, connections of BIM model data and related registers and
   their data exchange in the environment of Czech Republic ` s
   legislation. The more correctly processed the model of the building
   work, the better and more reliable information for future designs.},

   including scientific data. The supporting role of scientific data for
   socioeconomic development in good alignment with national security
   concerns is increasing with the rapid development of trusted
   environments and tools to share data and IT services for the transition
   from information to knowledge. How to balance open data and security
   concerns is an urgent challenge for scientific data governance and
   services, among which, the construction and implementation of scientific
   data security standards is the core and outstanding weakness.
   This paper reviews the essential attribute of scientific data-An
   objective record of human scientific activities and discoveries, and the
   research achievements on new challenges and characteristics of
   scientific data security in recent years, especially in combination with
   the actual challenge of massive data loss to foreign countries in the
   current complex international situation. The authors propose the basic
   characteristics of scientific data security, including the data supply
   chain security in the global research ecology, the balance between data
   security and open data, traditional data security baseline threaten by
   the advanced new technology and the diversification of data sources, and
   the new security challenge on data fusion from multi-sources data. This
   paper definites scientific data security as the state of effective
   protection and compliant utilization of scientific data with the full
   protection of data security and privacy, social public interests,
   legitimate rights and so on. To meet the global trend of open science
   data and data security concerns, this paper proposes a basic framework
   of data security that covers the full life cycle dimension of scientific
   data and the security dimension which includes confidentiality,
   availability, integrity, traceability, controllability and
   non-repudiation, and the life cycle model conforms to the national
   ``Measures for the Management of Scientific Data{''}, which includes
   data collection, data storage, data processing, data transmission, data
   services and open sharing. This paper also puts forward a basic standard
   which is named general requirements for security management of
   scientific data, and this standard mainly specifies some requirements
   from the security dimension and the life cycle dimension, and the
   requirements include security management, life cycle security, and
   physical security of computer,storage media and its' environment, such
   as building, pickproof, waterproof and so on. In the classification
   standard for scientific data security, a three-dimensional
   classification of security, subject, and data stage is given, and the
   4-level security model is determined based on the degree of damage to
   the affected objects of scientific data when the security attributes of
   scientific data are damaged, and in this standard open sharing of
   scientific data is clearly defined as an important level of 4-level
   security model. Finally, the article proposes some suggestions for
   scientific data security.
   In 2021, The UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science was released, which
   marks the official rise of the global Open science movement, and
   scientific data is one of the core knowledge resources. The research
   communities of China support the open sharing of scientific data to meet
   UNESCO Recommendation, and as practitioners of data centers actively
   participate in discussions and actions to ensure scientific data
   security and privacy through better data services or platforms with
   advanced technology. Scientific data security is a complex and
   comprehensive task that involves improper behavior by researchers or
   security challenges brought about by information technology, and these
   challenges require sufficient attention and further in-depth discussion.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM), a common technology contributing to
   information processing, is extensively applied in construction fields.
   BIM integration with augmented reality (AR) is flourishing in the
   construction industry, as it provides an effective solution for the
   lifecycle of a project. However, when applying BIM to AR data transfer,
   large and complicated models require large storage spaces, increase the
   model transfer time and data processing workload during rendering, and
   reduce visualization efficiency when using AR devices. The geometric
   optimization of the model using mesh reconstruction is a potential
   solution that can reduce the required storage while maintaining the
   shape of the components. In this study, a 3D engine-based mesh
   reconstruction algorithm that can pre-process BIM shape data and
   implement an AR-based full-size model is proposed, which is likely to
   increase the efficiency of decision making and project processing for
   construction management. As shown in the experimental validation, the
   proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of vertices,
   triangles, and storage for geometric models while maintaining the
   overall shape. Moreover, the model elements and components of the
   optimized model have the same visual quality as the original model;
   thus, a high performance can be expected for BIM visualization in AR
   devices.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {73-83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Facilities managers need to identify failure cause-effect patterns in
   order to prepare corrective and preventive maintenance plans. This task
   is difficult because of the complex interaction and interdependencies
   between different building components. Standardization based on Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) provides new opportunities to improve the
   efficiency of facilities management (FM) operations by sharing and
   exchanging building information between different applications
   throughout the lifecycle of the facilities. This paper aims to utilize
   BIM visualization capabilities to provide FM technicians with
   visualizations that allow them to utilize their cognitive and perceptual
   reasoning for problem solving. It investigates a knowledge-assisted
   BIM-based visual analytics approach for failure root-cause detection in
   FM. For this purpose, the inspection and maintenance data of
   Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are integrated with a
   BIM. Moreover, various sources of building knowledge such as fault trees
   and relationships between components are formally represented. These
   resources are used to create custom visualizations through an
   interactive user interface which helps in exploiting the heuristic
   problem solving ability of field experts to find root causes of failures
   in a building. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) enhances the sharing of information
   during the traditional process for new construction, but most of the
   time, it requires high levels of knowledge management for the historical
   digital model (H-BIM). The innovation in the Digital Cultural Heritage
   (DCH) domain is supported by the development of Information and
   Communications Technologies (ICT) and modern tools that are able to
   transmit morphological characteristics of the buildings in all their
   uniqueness. The latest research in the field of H-BIM shows a
   significant emergence of innovative methods and management initiatives
   for the generation of complex historical elements, leading to the
   confrontation of the paradigm of regularity (simple geometric shapes)
   with the new paradigm of complexity (historical building elements). This
   paper proves the benefits of the BIM for project management of the
   Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa, Ontario Canada, and
   shows the results obtained by the introduction of Advanced Modeling
   Techniques (AMT) during the generative process, reducing time and cost
   for the creation of the complex architectural and structural elements.
   The uniqueness of the forms of historical buildings is a real value to
   be transmitted throughout the building's lifecycle with high Levels of
   Detail (LOD). Proper management of geometric primitives and Non-Uniform
   Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) models have guaranteed the conversion of
   spatial data (point clouds) from laser scanning and photogrammetry
   (geometric survey) into parametric applications. This paper explores the
   generative process of one of the most complex spaces within The Centre
   Block building of Parliament Hill-Confederation Hall.},

Abstract = {Aligning the construction industry with performance demands, waste
   elimination, and sustainability is a recent development due to the
   emergence of new technological approaches and thoughts around
   future-proofing. This thinking often relies on innovation and the
   adoption of sustainable and environmentally friendly materials. However,
   trends in influencing the processes and approaches to construction
   management from the design phase to demolition are beginning to attract
   more attention. The use of information technology has provided solutions
   for monitoring and improving the performance of buildings from the
   design phase. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is at the forefront
   of emerging processes. It can be implemented throughout the construction
   lifecycle using centralized digital models created at the design phase,
   which is crucial for any successful performance. BIM has become a
   powerful solution that can advance and renovate many aspects of the
   construction sector. Despite its vital position in the economies of
   countries, this industry suffers from the dominance of many types of
   waste that hinder the improvement of the performance and productivity of
   this sector. This paper explores the optimization brought by BIM-based
   design on waste minimization of various kinds and its added value to
   achieve sustainable and efficient construction goals. After a
   demonstrative parade of BIM solutions for design made on two related
   pilot areas, building and road infrastructure, the study highlights the
   actual contribution of BIM on the elimination of time, budget, and
   environmental wastes. The results also reveal the impact of efficient
   design on the performance of the building process and the ecological and
   energetic optimizations brought about. In addition, it sheds new light
   on critical wasteful aspects that hinder the efficiency of the act of
   building, which is: design complexity - loss of data and information -
   design updates - budgetary - time and environmental waste. Copyright (C)

   papers have considered the selected technologies in the integration with
   each other. However, a specific gap exists in the literature regarding
   the interactions and potential synergies among these technologies. This
   gap limits the understanding of how these integrations can address
   challenges unique to the construction industry and hinders the
   development of comprehensive solutions. The review has been analyzed and
   discussed in reference to the type of article, single or multi
   technologies, the lifecycle, and their applications. The study showed
   that the integration of BIM, Blockchain, and LiDAR, as a recent trend
   and as a beneficial solution to automate the whole construction process,
   has considerable capacities to improve the productivity of the
   construction industry. Finally, some application areas for the
   integration of these three technologies are concluded and are suggested,
   and therefore, an advantageous reference has been provided for scholars
   to plan their future research in this sector.},

Abstract = {With the development of a new generation of information technology,
   digital twin generation has become a research trend. However, as a
   complex system oriented to the product life cycle, there are some
   challenges for its achievement. As a widely accepted and applied
   methodology, most industrial fields agreed with that model-based system
   engineering (MBSE) can improve design quality, development efficiency
   and avoid risks in the design phase. However, there is few work to
   discuss the connection between them. Therefore, we explore to apply the
   model-base system architecture process to implement digital twin system,
   and adjust some detailed design process for adapting to the
   characteristics of DT. Finally, taking a human-robot system as an
   example to illustrate the process of building digital twin system
   architecture with SysML, moreover, architectural trade-off analysis
   method (ATAM) demonstrate the applicability of the MBSE-based method in
   digital twin system designing. This paper presents digital twin system
   development process based on MBSE based method, and provide a reference
   for other researchers.},

Abstract = {The traditional fragmented nature of the construction industry along
   with the ad hoc matter in which investments in ICT have been made has
   resulted in a key cause of the poor performance and inefficiencies of
   the industry being attributed to the communication and exchange of
   information. The concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM) emerged
   to address the seamless exchange of information throughout the life of a
   facility following early modelling efforts focused on providing a
   solution to data exchange problems between several CAD and analysis
   systems. On the other hand. ICT supported collaborative teamwork has
   been an important aspect of building lifecycle management over the years
   in order to address the problems related to the fragmented nature of the
   industry. In parallel, recent studies in the field have demonstrated
   that BIMs will play an important role in facilitating collaboration.
   Most of the studies related to collaborative computing in construction
   have focused on facilitating the coordination and communication aspects
   of collaboration. In contrast, this paper proposes a system level and
   BIM-based approach for facilitating collaboration through the entire
   lifecycle of the building. In this context, the paper presents two
   design patterns that can be used as a foundation in formulating the
   design of information systems for BIM-based synchronous collaboration.
   The proposed patterns will help the system analysts/designers to focus
   on a system level picture when tackling recurring problems in the design
   of collaborative environments. Following a brief summary on the history
   of information modelling in the construction industry, this paper
   reviews the storage and exchange mechanisms of BIMs and then proposes
   two design patterns as a means to facilitating model-based synchronous
   collaboration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring and verifying BIM-based energy simulation for building
   operations},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1679-1702},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Purpose The operational phase of a building's lifecycle is receiving
   increasing attention, as it consumes an enormous amount of energy and
   results in tremendous detrimental impacts on the environment. While
   energy simulation can be applied as a tool to evaluate the energy
   performance of a building in operation, the emergence of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) technology is expected to facilitate the
   evaluation process with predefined and enriched building information.
   However, such an approach has been confronted by the challenge of
   interoperability issues among the related application software,
   including the BIM tools and energy simulation tools, and the results of
   simulation have been seldom verified due to the unavailability of
   corresponding experimental data. This study aims to explore the
   interoperability between the commonly used energy simulation and BIM
   tools and verifies the simulation approach by undertaking a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach With Autodesk Revit and EnergyPlus selected
   as the commonly used BIM and energy simulation tools, respectively, a
   valid technical framework of transferring building information between
   two tools is proposed, and the interoperability issues that occur during
   the data transfer are studied. The proposed framework is then employed
   to simulate the energy consumption of a single-family house, and
   sensitivity analysis and analysis on such parameters as schedule are
   conducted for building operations to showcase its applicability.
   Findings The simulation results are compared with monitored data and the
   results from another simulation tool, HOT2000; the comparison reveals
   that EnergyPlus and HOT2000 predict the total energy consumption with a
   difference from the monitoring data of 8.0 and 7.1\%, respectively.
   Practical implications This research shows how to efficiently use BIM to
   support building energy simulation. Relevant stakeholders can learn from
   this research to avoid data loss during BIM model transformation.
   Originality/value This research explores the application of BIM for
   building energy simulation, compares the simulation results among
   different tools and validates simulation results using monitored data.},

Title = {Multi-criteria decision support model for selecting the appropriate
   construction management firm},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 3},
Abstract = {Construction management (CM) companies serve as representatives for
   clients, aiding them in overseeing construction projects throughout the
   project's entire life cycle. Opting for the right CM firm enhances the
   likelihood of a successful project completion. Existing research has
   highlighted a lack of decision support models for CM firms. This study
   introduces a multi-criteria decision support model employing the
   Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for the selection of suitable
   Construction Management firms. The primary objective of this model is to
   guide decision-makers in choosing the most suitable CM firm, ensuring
   that the provider offers the necessary services from project initiation
   to closure. Additionally, this research seeks to standardize the CM firm
   selection process based on key criteria, which were identified through a
   literature review. The significance of these criteria was assessed via a
   survey distributed to construction professionals in the United Arab
   Emirates (UAE). The survey collected feedback by having respondents make
   pairwise comparisons of the identified criteria. The data, consisting of
   52 survey responses, were analysed using Expert Choice software and
   utilized to construct the AHP-based model. The findings reveal that the
   most crucial factors for CM firm selection are prior experience in
   similar projects, financial stability, proficiency in Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), the qualifications and capabilities of key
   staff members, ongoing project experience, and expertise in risk
   management. The study also presents a four-stage framework that
   decision-makers can follow when selecting the appropriate CM firm, and
   it includes a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed
   model.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to implement a simulation model in
   @RISKTM and study the impact of incorporating random variables, such as
   the degree days in a traditional deterministic model, for calculating
   the optimum thickness of thermal insulation in walls. Currently, green
   buildings have become important because of the increasing worldwide
   interest in the reduction of environmental pollution. One method of
   saving energy is to use thermal insulation. The optimum thickness of
   these insulators has traditionally been calculated using deterministic
   models. With the information generated from real data using the degree
   days required in a certain zone in Palestine during winter, random
   samples of the degree days required annually in this town were generated
   for periods of 10, 20, 50, and 70 years. The results showed that the
   probability of exceeding the net present value of the cost calculated
   using deterministic analysis ranges from 0\% to 100\%, without regard to
   the inflation rate. The results also show that, for design lifetimes
   greater than 40 years, the risk of overspending is lower if the building
   lasts longer than the period for which it was designed. Moreover, this
   risk is transferred to whomever will pay the operating costs of heating
   the building. The contribution of this research is twofold: (a) a
   stochastic approach is incorporated into the traditional models that
   determine the optimum thickness of thermal insulation used in buildings,
   by introducing the variability of the degree days required in a given
   region; (b) a measure of the economic risk incurred by building heating
   is established as a function of the years of use for which the building
   is designed and the number of years it is actually used.},

Abstract = {The integration of the building information modelling (BIM) and assets
   database has enabled a potential pathway for building stakeholders to
   add value to the building lifecycle management (BLM) processes. However,
   the obtaining, storing, processing, and distributing of data have not
   been ratified in a detailed and semantic manner in any official
   guideline. This paper suggests a framework for the efficient development
   of an interoperable visualisation of a building ``digital twin{''}
   through an intuitive interface, to contribute to the idea above. The
   framework was applied in two case studies as examples, where rich
   visualisations of two buildings in the Kanta-flame region of Finland
   were constructed using their architectural models and building indoor
   climate metrics. By constructing an engaging interface, relevant metrics
   and constant feedback from buildings' occupants are gathered, meaningful
   data is selected, processed, and displayed to improve the facility
   management (FM) process. The yielded result is a progressive web
   application (PWA), where valuable sets of building performance data are
   visualised and a promptly communicable channel between owners/occupants
   and building system is delivered. Further development of this
   application in practice and research work is also proposed to harness
   the data-driven monitoring and automation in buildings to the greatest
   extent.},

Abstract = {In the last years it has been progressively invested many efforts in the
   cultural heritage digitization: surveying, modeling activities,
   diagnostic analysis and historic data collection of architectural
   heritage. Such actions have been mainly acquired for the preservation
   process, during the restoration and construction site. Unfortunately,
   many of them are left abandoned in a latent status without any
   connection with the long life cycle of the historic architectures or
   connection to the dissemination. The paper presents the case of an
   informative model for the Basilica di Collemaggio generated on high
   resolution surveying (laser scanning, photogrammetric point clouds and
   IRT Infrared Thermography) to manage the knowledge acquired on the
   geometry and the collected information on materials, construction
   technology and decay analysis for the design and conservation after the
   earthquake occurred at L'Aquila. The paper illustrates the HBIM
   (Heritage Building Information Model) achieved to support the
   restoration process funded by EniServizi within the project `Restart
   from Collemaggio'. It is described the generative modelling process
   implemented to embody the complexity and specificity of the morphology
   related to the collected information on the state of the art, the sum of
   the current damages and transformations during the centuries, for the
   preservation plan of the monument. Many damaged structures as in the
   case of the north wall with the Holy Door and of the arched naves with
   the ancient pillars have been restored preserving the maximum level of
   authenticity of the materials and construction techniques. The HBIM of
   the Basilica, re-opened to the public on December 2017, is ready to a
   sentinel role among past present and future.},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The European Union supports the use of technology to improve public
   procurement, acknowledging Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a
   catalyst for cost-effective public works and innovation. The purpose of
   this paper is to evaluate BIM implementation practices in Spanish public
   procurement. The methodology used in this study is a mixed research
   method involving a questionnaire survey and semi -structured expert
   interviews. The findings reveal market maturity as a barrier to BIM
   adoption in Spanish public procurement throughout the asset lifecycle.
   Selecting the right instrument for implementation proves challenging for
   public organizations. This study has contributed to the development of
   more practical and effective strategies to ensure full adoption of BIM
   within the public procurement sector of Spain. It proposes a framework
   approach for the pre -contractual phase, helping contracting authorities
   to make the optimal instrument selection. Two criteria are considered:
   the maturity of the public client and sector, and the economic value
   classification of tenders.},

Title = {Quantitative Evaluation Method and Process of BIM Data for Generating
   BIM-Based 2D Deliverables},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Views, drawings, and data extracted from building information modeling
   (BIM) constitute essential deliverables throughout the lifecycle of an
   architecture, engineering, and construction project, offering crucial
   insights for comprehending the design. Nevertheless, many employers
   evaluating BIM deliverables lack standardized criteria for the specific
   intended use of each BIM outcome, which hampers the practical utility of
   BIM results. This study introduces a quantitative evaluation method for
   the management of BIM-based two-dimensional (2D) deliverables. The BIM
   outcome measurement index for 2D deliverables (BOMI-2D) is formulated to
   provide a quantitative assessment of BIM data, focusing on their
   composition, structure, data readiness, and consistency. Pilot tests
   validated the efficacy of BOMI-2D, revealing an impressive 88.3\%
   reduction in additional work required for 2D deliverables when data
   readiness increased by 25\% and consistency improved by 32\%. BOMI-2D is
   poised to play a pivotal role as an evaluation index for BIM data and
   outcomes, ultimately enhancing their utilization and productivity.},

Title = {Building Information Modelling for performance-based Fire Safety
   Engineering analysis - A strategy for data sharing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Hackitt Report into the tragic loss of 72 lives in the Grenfell
   Tower fire, identified failures and poor practices associated with the
   UK construction industry. To address these failures the report makes
   several recommendations, including the development of a ``golden thread
   of information{''} to be embedded throughout the entire building
   lifecycle enabling the recording and preservation of information. This
   is to be achieved through Building Information Modelling (BIM). However,
   to create a ``golden thread of information{''} in BIM from the Fire
   Safety Engineering (FSE) perspective particularly for the
   performance-based approach, many significant challenges and limitations
   must be resolved. These challenges include the fact that no FSE specific
   information exchange is available in BIM and that the results produced
   by fire and evacuation modelling tools are not explicitly captured in
   the BIM Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) Model. Of the FSE tools that
   support BIM, this is mainly limited to geometry extraction from an IFC
   file. In this paper, a practical conceptual strategy to pave the way to
   resolve these problems is proposed. A number of developments by the
   authors are discussed, forming part of an international collaboration
   project proposal administered by buildingSMART to enhance the IFC Model
   from the FSE perspective. Additionally, to evaluate and demonstrate the
   benefits of two-way data flow between BIM and FSE tools, a prototype
   system together with a preliminary FSE based analysis database have been
   developed. The work presented in this paper, provides a practical road
   map for creating a `golden thread of information' in BIM for
   performance-based FSE analysis.},

Abstract = {Efficient energy demand management in the residential sector must be
   designed based on a sufficient understanding of factors. This study
   focuses on apartments, a mainstream housing type in Korea. The
   combination of factor analysis and quantile regression analysis provides
   insight into the sociocultural meaning of home appliance ownership and
   use pattern and the differential impact on electricity consumption. The
   eight representative home appliances closely related to electricity
   consumption in the household sector are related to household
   composition, life cycle, economic ability, education, and occupation
   type. Additionally, the influence of home appliances on electricity
   consumption is not constant and is differentiated depending on the
   consumption level of each household. These attempts can provide
   customized information on specific housing type groups emerging in the
   future economic development and urban development process. In
   residential energy demand management, further segmentation and
   specification of the target and content of information provision will
   increase the effectiveness of policy achievement.},

Title = {A Parameter-Driven Method for Modeling Bridge Defects through IFC},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Bridges experience regular inspections from transport
   agencies/authorities periodically. However, current approaches for the
   storage and visualization of inspection-related data are often
   restricted to spreadsheets and inspection reports and cannot
   sufficiently support open building information modeling (BIM) processes.
   This research proposes an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based method
   to document and represent inspection-related information in bridge BIM
   models. Specifically, the geometry of defects, including spatial
   placement and shape representation, was modeled parametrically.
   Interrelationships between defects and other IFC entities (e.g., bridge
   elements, root causes, and maintenance actions) were represented. The
   proposed method was validated on a concrete highway bridge, with two
   scenarios designed to illustrate its capability to support cause
   diagnosis and maintenance decision making. The interoperability of the
   proposed method across different BIM tools was evaluated as well. This
   work demonstrates the parametric-driven representation of defect
   information based on the latest IFC, facilitating an integrated BIM
   environment for the lifecycle management of civil assets.},

Abstract = {A stochastic Petri-net formalism is proposed to predict the degradation
   of ceramic claddings over time in order to understand how different
   environmental exposure conditions contribute to the overall degradation
   of these claddings. For that purpose, the degradation condition of 195
   ceramic claddings located in Lisbon, Portugal, is evaluated through in
   situ visual inspections. In the first part of the study, a stochastic
   deterioration Petri-net model is proposed for the entire sample. In the
   second part, the original sample is divided according to the
   environmental exposure conditions, evaluating the influence of these
   conditions on the deterioration process of ceramic claddings. Four main
   degradation agents are analyzed: exposure to moisture; distance from the
   sea; orientation; and wind-rain action. The results reveal that Petri
   nets can accurately describe the deterioration process of ceramic
   claddings, providing relevant information regarding the performance of
   these claddings through their life cycle and according to the
   environmental exposure conditions to which they are subject. These
   results are extremely relevant for different practitioners: the approach
   allows the adoption of more sustainable and durable solutions at the
   design stage, as well as improving the durability of the ceramic
   claddings by performing optimized maintenance plans and strategies.},

Title = {Large language models driven BIM-based DfMA method for free-form
   prefabricated buildings: framework and a usefulness case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 24},
Abstract = {The escalating demand for free-form buildings presents a formidable
   technological hurdle in the realm of prefabrication manufacturing and
   assembly. This research draws inspiration from recent advancements in
   large language models (LLMs) and seeks to harness their transformative
   potential in tandem with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to advance
   the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) method. The ultimate aim
   is to catapult the prefabrication industry into an era characterized by
   unparalleled design freedom and heightened efficiency. The research
   includes contributions from the following four areas: (1) A review of
   the literature on DfMA theories, specifically fabrication and
   construction. (2) The development of a BIM-based DfMA method framework,
   including the methodological basis, Design for Manufacturing (DfM), and
   Design for Assembly (DfA). (3) A pipeline for LLMs driven BIM-based DfMA
   method framework and a validation using the Decathlon Solar Team
   design-build practice at the University of Washington's Lotus House. (4)
   An evaluation of 692 conversation scenarios to verify the feasibility of
   our proposal. We get a 91.1\% user agreement on average based on GPT4.
   The research results could guide the workflow in building a lifecycle
   for DfMA practices in the future smart manufacturing era.},

Abstract = {The current dominant computing mode in the AEC (Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction) domain is standalone based, causing
   fragmentation and fundamental interoperability problems. This makes the
   collaboration required to deal with the interconnected and complex tasks
   associated with a sustainable and resilient built environment extremely
   difficult.
   This article aims to discuss how the latest computing technologies can
   be leveraged for the AEC domain and Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   in particular. These technologies include Cloud Computing, the Internet
   of Things and Big Data Analytics.
   The data rich BIM domain will be analysed to identify relevant
   characteristics, opportunities and the likely challenges. A clear case
   will be established detailing why BIM needs these technologies and how
   they can be brought together to bring about a paradigm shift in the
   industry.
   Having identified the potential application of new technologies, a
   future platform will be proposed. It will carry out large scale,
   real-time processing of data from all stakeholders. The platform will
   facilitate the collaborative interpretation, manipulation and analysis
   of data for the whole lifecycle of building projects. It will be
   flexible, intelligent and able to autonomously execute analysis and
   choose the relevant tools. This will form a base for a step-change for
   computing tools in the AEC domain.},

Abstract = {The oil and gas industry is a technology-driven industry. Over the last
   two decades, it has heavily made use of digital modeling and associated
   technologies (DMAT) to enhance its commercial capability. Meanwhile, the
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) has grown at an exponential rate in
   the built environment sector. It is not only a digital representation of
   physical and functional characteristics of a facility, but it has also
   made an impact on the management processes of building project
   lifecycle. It is apparent that there are many similarities between BIM
   and DMAT usability in the aspect of physical modeling and functionality.
   The aim of this study is to streamline the usage of both DMAT and BIM
   whilst discovering valuable practices for performance improvement in the
   oil and gas projects. To achieve this, 28 BIM guidelines, 83 DMAT
   academic publications and 101 DMAT vendor case studies were selected for
   review. The findings uncover (a) 38 BIM uses; (b) 32 DMAT uses and; (c)
   36 both DMAT and BIM uses. The synergy between DMAT and BIM uses would
   render insightful references into managing efficient oil and gas's
   projects. It also helps project stakeholders to recognise future
   investment or potential development areas of BIM and DMAT uses in their
   projects.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the current framework of energy transition, renewable energy
   production has gained a renewed relevance. A set of 75 papers was
   selected from the existing literature and critically analyzed to
   understand the main inputs and tools used to calculate solar energy and
   derive theoretical photovoltaic production based on geographic
   information systems (GISs). A heterogeneous scenario for solar energy
   estimation emerged from the analysis, with a prevalence of 2.5D
   tools-mainly ArcGIS and QGIS-whose calculation is refined chiefly by
   inputting weather data from databases. On the other hand, despite some
   minor changes, the formula for calculating the photovoltaic potential is
   widely acknowledged and includes solar energy, exploitable surface,
   performance ratio, and panel efficiency. While sectorial
   studies-targeting a specific component of the calculation-are sound, the
   comprehensive ones are generally problematic due to excessive
   simplification of some parts. Moreover, validation is often lacking or,
   when present, only partial. The research on the topic is in constant
   evolution, increasingly moving towards purely 3D models and refining the
   estimation to include the time component-both in terms of life cycle and
   variations between days and seasons.},

Abstract = {Lifecycle and effective dada management has become and still remains a
   difficult task in architecture, engineering, and construction domain.
   Recently, the emerging Building Information Modeling (BIM) gains more
   and more momentum in construction data presenting, processing, and
   sharing. With precise 3D digital geometry graphs, BIM has the potential
   to integrate diverse data from construction phases (design,
   construction, maintenance) and therefore becomes a promising
   collaboration platform for involved personnel. High efficiency BIM model
   processing is one of the critical issues for construction industry to
   truly embrace BIM technology. However, this topic has been rarely
   studied compared with other issues in BIM research. This paper presents
   an augmented version of Map Reduce (MR), the popular distributed
   parallel computing model, to solve this problem. The main contribution
   lies in two points: 1) BIM models are extracted into uneven partitions
   according to construction domain features, followed by a specifically
   designed pre-process mechanism, which solves the unsuitability of
   classical MR's even blocking in construction domain and further greatly
   improves performance; 2) process and thread level parallel computing
   techniques are introduced into MR in single node to form a two-tier
   hybrid parallel architecture, which is more adaptive to BIM's massive
   graphical data processing. The proposed framework has been successfully
   used in real business applications of project quantity computation and
   BIM model collision detection. Experiment result from lab environment
   proves its efficiency and usability.},

Title = {Development of a rooftop solar photovoltaic rating system considering

Abstract = {The successful deployment of distributed solar generation in urban areas
   involves the evaluation of how suitable a building is for installing the
   rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system within a region. When evaluating
   the rooftop solar PV suitability of a building, it is crucial to
   consider not only its technical but also its economic performance as the
   difference in technical performance can lead to different financial
   returns for rooftop solar PV adopters. Towards this end, this study
   aimed to propose a method for developing a rooftop solar PV rating
   system using cluster analysis based on the technical and economic
   suitability criteria. As a result, a rooftop solar PV rating system was
   developed for 21,681 buildings in the Gangnam district in Seoul, South
   Korea by dividing them into four grades according to their rooftop solar
   PV potential, return on investment, and payback period. The
   effectiveness of the proposed rating system was validated by comparing
   it with the rating systems developed using the classification method and
   suitability criteria from the previous studies. This study has
   significant contributions in that it can provide the rooftop solar PV
   suitability information on a grade scale for intuitive decision-making
   based on scientific evidence and reasonable criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the context of big data and the Internet of Things, with the
   advancement of geospatial data acquisition and retrieval, the volume of
   available geospatial data is increasing every minute. Thus, new
   data-management architecture is needed. We proposed a building
   information model (BIM) big data-storage-management solution with hybrid
   storage architecture based on web virtual reality geographical
   information system (WebVRGIS). BIM is associated with the integration of
   spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban
   building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution
   characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and
   management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The
   architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language
   (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of
   the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform
   as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that
   the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower
   response time compared to the traditional relational database in
   geospatial big data searches. The integration and fusion of BIM big data
   in WebVRGIS realizes a revolutionary transformation of city information
   management during a full lifecycle. The system also has great promise
   for the storage of other geospatial big data, such as traffic data.},

Title = {Feature modeling for configurable and adaptable modular buildings},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Current design approaches for new buildings do not sufficiently plan for
   or adapt to changing conditions that could be used to extend the useful
   life of buildings, as part of a circular economy. While notable advances
   have emerged for using BIM-based configurators to improve building
   design and project execution, there is a need expand such configurators
   to look at how buildings can be adapted and re-configured across their
   lifecycle. This paper develops and demonstrates an innovative feature
   modeling approach for configuring and adapting modular buildings. This
   study uses BIM for structuring intricate feature relationships of
   specific design aspects in terms of product circularity. The design
   aspects considered are structural design, dimensional variation control,
   and disassembly planning design. Feature parameter maps, which are a
   general constraint relation representation, are implemented to describe
   the data models since they are an efficient way to visualize feature
   elements and interdependencies, to avoid the creation of redundant
   information, and to improve data structure consistency. The application
   of the proposed methodology is validated with a functional demonstration
   of a conceptual design and optimization for a single module that is
   meant to be part of a modular construction project. The product model
   was synthesized in a parametric BIM environment for iterative
   configuration, analysis of results, and final optimization of the single
   module assembly. The demonstration case study shows that BIM can be
   adapted to assist on modeling specific design aspects for modular
   buildings and to create design alternatives. Also, the method shows a
   considerable benefit that the designer can produce diverse accurate
   design alternatives within a reduced amount of time.},

Abstract = {Dwelling renovation has gained major importance in the European Union
   due to the current need for the urban regeneration of many cities, most
   of whose existing buildings (approximately 60\%) were built in the 1960s
   to 1980s. These renovations require improvements in aspects such as
   structural integrity, accessibility, and the updating of deteriorated or
   obsolescent installations. This reveals that building renovations
   constitute a key factor in the future of the European building sector
   and must be included in strategies both for the reduction of this
   sector's environmental impact and for climate change mitigation. In
   order to determine the effectiveness of renovations and their impact,
   the HEREVEA (Huella Ecologica de la Rehabilitacion de Viviendas en
   Andalucia or Ecological Footprint of the Renovation of Dwellings in
   Andalusia) model is proposed on data obtained from the project's bill of
   quantities, its ecological footprint is assessed, and the
   economic-environmental feasibility of different proposals are evaluated
   simultaneously. The resulting model is integrated into a geographic
   information system, which allows georeferenced results. The tool can be
   used for sustainable and resilient planning policy-making at all
   government levels, and for the decision-making processes. In this paper,
   economic and environmental indicators are, for the first time,
   simultaneously assessed through statistical normalization obtained from
   50 cases analyzed in the city of Seville. Furthermore, five case studies
   are assessed in detail in order to determine the sensitivity of the
   model. These renovations represent less than 30\% of the cost and 6\% of
   the ecological footprint of a new construction project. During the
   subsequent 25 years, the energy efficiency improvements could
   significantly reduce the CO2 emissions that are due to direct
   consumption.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a process that contain all the
   necessary information to manage the construction project across all its
   lifecycle. This benefits not only the construction industry but other
   industries such as utility companies that need to perform tasks inside
   of buildings and will need to access information about its elements.
   However, one of the biggest challenges is the digitalisation of the
   existing infrastructure. The use of semantic segmentation techniques
   could enable the transformation of infrastructure legacy data, such as
   2D floor plans images, to open-standard BIM models. In this paper, we
   propose a processing pipeline to transform 2D floor plan images into BIM
   models. The pipeline makes use of an interval Type-2 Fuzzy Rule-based
   System (FRBS) that has an Intersection over Union metric value of
   98.62\% outperforming the Type-1 version of the model. Moreover, the
   proposed model is highly transparent, and it allows end-users to augment
   it using expert knowledge, something that is not possible in deep
   learning opaque-box models.},

Title = {Evaluating recycling potential of demolition waste considering building
   structure types: A study in South Korea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {256},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {This study investigates the recycling potential of demolition waste (DW)
   according to building structure, while considering environmental and
   economic aspects For that, this study surveyed 1,034 residential
   buildings in Korea immediately before demolition to collect reliable
   information on demolition waste generation rates (DWGRs). This study
   classified the removal stages of buildings into the demolition,
   collection and sorting, transportation, and disposal stages. This study
   suggested a method for carbon emissions calculation for each stage and
   carried out an inventory analysis. The economic value of recycled DW
   materials was also calculated. Furthermore, the recycling potential was
   calculated based on the economic value and the environmental load for
   the current scenario, i.e., the current waste recycling rate in Korea,
   and the maximum scenario, i.e., the maximum theoretical recycling rate.
   Regarding building structures, the recycling potential of wooden
   structures was the highest in both the scenarios. However, masonry-block
   structures showed improved recycling potential in the maximum scenario.
   Regarding DW types, the recycling potential of plastics was the highest,
   with plastics from reinforced concrete (RC) structures showing 6.6 times
   higher recycling potential than those from wooden structures. And the
   possibility of improving the recycling potential was higher for glass
   and plastics than aggregates, timber, and metals. Through the above
   research, this paper devised an approach that can be used to plan a
   detailed construction and demolition waste management strategy,
   considering building structures and DW types, and this method can also
   be applied to other regions and countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Integrating BIM into facility management: Typology matrix of information

Abstract = {Purpose Integrating building information modelling (BIM) into facility
   management (FM) has generated fervent debate within the extant
   literature given an increasing realisation amongst practitioners that
   the majority of BIM benefits reside within the whole lifecycle
   management. Converting a building's in-use data and information into
   tangible business knowledge to augment FM performance is crucial for
   business growth and prosperity. Yet curiously, scant academic attention
   has been paid in investigating the data and information hand-over
   process through BIM required by FM. The purpose of this paper is to
   address this knowledge gap.
   Design/methodology/approach The research approach adopted draws upon
   pertinent BIM in the FM literature and a qualitative discourse accrued
   via focus group meetings of Australian FM experts.
   Findings The study's findings are presented as a data and information
   typology matrix that captures the associations among different forms of
   data ownership, FM service delivery categories and data and information
   typologies for using BIM in FM.
   Practical implications The analysis results will prove invaluable for
   policy-makers, researchers and practitioners by providing a relevant
   data and information typology and capturing the complex associations in
   the process of integrating BIM into FM.
   Originality/value This study contributes to the field by providing a
   better understanding of different forms of data and information,
   required by members of a FM team. The original insight shared here is
   the necessity to consider a distinctive array of interests and the
   potential for using different forms of data and information when
   integrating BIM into FM.},

   Our framework is comprised of both a workflow and documentation and aims
   to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results

   desiderata for interpretable machine learning as part of veridical data
   science (with PDR standing for predictive accuracy, predictive accuracy
   and relevancy to a human audience and a particular domain problem).
   The PCS framework will be illustrated through the development of the
   DeepTune framework for characterizing V4 neurons. DeepTune builds
   predictive models using DNNs and ridge regression and applies the
   stability principle to obtain stable interpretations of 18 predictive
   models. Finally, a general DNN interpretaion method based on contexual
   decomposition (CD) will be discussed with applications to sentiment
   analysis and cosmological parameter estimation.},

Title = {Segmentation of Structural Elements from 3D Point Cloud Using Spatial
   Dependencies for Sustainability Studies},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The segmentation of point clouds obtained from existing buildings
   provides the ability to perform a detailed structural analysis and
   overall life-cycle assessment of buildings. The major challenge in
   dealing with existing buildings is the presence of diverse and large
   amounts of occluding objects, which limits the segmentation process. In
   this study, we use unsupervised methods that integrate knowledge about
   the structural forms of buildings and their spatial dependencies to
   segment points into common structural classes. We first develop a
   novelty approach of joining remotely disconnected patches that happened
   due to missing data from occluding objects using pairs of detected
   planar patches. Afterward, segmentation approaches are introduced to
   classify the pairs of refined planes into floor slabs, floor beams,
   walls, and columns. Finally, we test our approach using a large dataset
   with high levels of occlusions. We also compare our approach to recent
   segmentation methods. Compared to many other segmentation methods the
   study shows good results in segmenting structural elements by their
   constituent surfaces. Potential areas of improvement, particularly in
   segmenting walls and beam classes, are highlighted for further studies.},

Abstract = {The potential of building information modeling (BIM) to add value to
   facilities management (FM) has long been recognized. The usefulness of
   BIM in asset management, including operations and maintenance has been
   described by numerous authors. Crucial to its implementation is the
   integration of information, which increases efficiency and productivity
   on the job and, in turn, positively impacts the primary organization's
   mission and goals. In view of the potential of BIM to add value to FM
   which in turn can boost the mission of organizations, there is a
   potential to study the experiences of early adopters, map out patterns
   and differences and to record lessons learned. This research aims to
   investigate how BIM is implemented in FM operations, how value can be
   derived and what the critical success factors are. It further explores
   the areas of process waste and consequent loss of value within the
   lifecycle phases of facilities. To this effect, the case study of a
   large tertiary educational institution is undertaken, mapping the
   processes of information flow during the translation phase from 2D
   drawings to 3D models of existing buildings. Value stream mapping of
   organizational processes will identify areas of potential waste or
   non-value-adding activities, and also areas of potential value-adding
   opportunities. By studying BIM value through the lifecycle value chain,
   and identifying good practices and challenges in light of the more
   subjective nature of value delivery in FM, more impactful outcomes
   should be derived.},

   This Web-based platform lets geographically dispersed project
   participants from facility managers and architects to electricians to

   participants move around in the building being designed and obtain

   a semantic model called CDMF and IFC 2x3. CDMF improves data management
   during the lifecycle of a building. Based on graph combinations and the

   of model evolution, of data mapping, management, of temporal data and
   the problem of the data adaptation according to the use and the user.

   digitalization: Comparison of intrusive and nonintrusive approaches},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {145},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Under digitalization-driven carbon neutrality in the building energy
   sector, in-situ virtual sensors could play a role in informative sensing
   environments and information modeling in building operations. This study
   proposes methodologies for the in-situ observation of virtual sensors
   and their in-situ calibration in building operations and digitalization.
   In the context of the building life cycle, in-situ observation virtual
   sensors are developed based on building related physics principles and
   design information, without physical observations, and then they are
   calibrated using two calibration approaches: (1) nonintrusive-indirect
   and (2) intrusive-direct calibrations. A comparative study is conducted
   to investigate the effectiveness of physics-based in-situ virtual
   sensors in real operation, compare the two calibration performances, and
   suggest recommendations for each calibration approach for real
   applications. According to a field study in a target district substation
   serving residential buildings, the in-situ observation virtual sensor
   for the demand-side return water temperature showed a root mean squared
   error (RMSE) of 0.81 C-? before calibration in the heating season (112
   days). The RMSEs of 0.61 and 0.55( ?)C were found for the
   nonintrusive-indirect and intrusive-direct calibrations in the
   representative case, respectively. These results showed the
   effectiveness of nonintrusive-indirect calibration, even though the
   target observations were unknown in the calibration. This study
   recommends obtaining informative datasets for improved intrusive
   calibration. In the case study, calibration with the informative dataset
   for 1 day (RMSE of 0.59 C-?) was superior to that of the average RMSE
   for nonintrusive calibration. The current energy patterns could be a
   basis for deciding whether the next few days are suitable for obtaining
   informative intrusive datasets, resulting in better calibration accuracy
   or shortening of the required datasets.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of geo-referenced information changed the way on
   how we access and interlink data. Smartphones as enabling devices for
   information access are main driving factor. Thus, the hash key to
   information is the actual position registered via camera and sensory of
   the mobile device. A rising technology in this context is Augmented
   Reality (AR) as its fuses the real world captured with the smartphone
   camera with geo-referenced data. The technological building blocks
   analyse the intrinsic sensor data (camera, GPS, inertial) to derive a
   detailed pose of the smartphone aiming to align geo-referenced
   information to our real environment. In particular, this is interesting
   to applications where 3D models are used in planning and organization
   processes as, e.g., facility management. Here, Building Information
   Models (BIM) were established in order to hold ``as built{''}
   information, but also to manage the vast amount of additional
   information coming with the design, such as building components,
   properties, maintenance logs, documentation, etc. One challenge is to
   enable stakeholders involved in the overall building lifecycle to get
   mobile access to the management system within on-site inspections and to
   automatise feedback of newly generated information into the BIM. This
   paper describes a new AR framework that offers on-site access to BIM
   information and user centric annotation mechanism.},

Title = {Modelling and predicting the generation of post-demolition autoclaved
   aerated concrete (AAC) volumes in Germany until 2050},

Abstract = {Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) has a porous structure and excellent
   thermal properties. Therefore, it is a frequently used building material
   for masonry units, prefabricated reinforced components and lightweight
   mineral insulation boards with increasing popularity. Post-demolition
   AAC is currently mainly disposed of in landfills. Decreasing landfill
   capacities, the legal framework, and protection of primary resources
   require developing recycling options for AAC. However, so far, no
   overall recycling of post-demolition AAC has been established yet. Only
   AAC primary process waste is recirculated or discharged, for example as
   an absorbent for chemicals or animal bedding. For high-quality
   post-demolition AAC recycling, only minimal information about recyclable
   volumes and their regional distribution is available. Therefore, a new
   dynamic retrospective and prospective AAC quantification model on a
   national level using AAC production, construction activity, AAC
   popularity, and buildings' lifetimes is developed to assess
   geographically distributed current and future post-demolition AAC
   volumes. This new model is applied to quantify post-demolition AAC
   volumes in a case study for Germany in the period between 1950 and 2050.
   For validation, the results are compared with two different approaches
   and with data from the literature. The AAC quantification allows
   decision support for the circular management of AAC during its life
   cycle and along its value/supply chain regarding design, location
   planning, logistics, production, and recycling.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has many benefits, and can be used
   throughout the building lifecycle. At the initial planning stage
   building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design
   decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data
   transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC
   schema lacks an energy domain, so an extension is proposed which
   contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning
   Package (PHPP). The extended schema was used to create an object
   oriented tool which facilitates the transfer of data. The process of
   geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies which
   are based in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales.},

Abstract = {Asset management is a continuous process that runs throughout the
   lifecycle of a constructed facility. The current practice of asset
   management is paper-based consisting of manual inspection and proves to
   be time consuming, tedious, and prone to human error. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) has been found to be an emerging technology
   and core of information management for the design, construction,
   operation and maintenance (O\&M) process. Though the usefulness of BIM
   has been greatly realized in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction) industry, its use for O\&M, particularly in asset
   management, is still in its infancy. This research describes a framework
   of an intelligent BIM record model that can capture all the assets in
   BIM during the construction of a building facility. All the information
   necessary for operation and maintenance along with the location would be
   stored in a database integrating with the BIM. The database library can
   be interrogated with BIM and serves as a repository of asset management
   for the built facility. The BIM record model would help to take informed
   decisions regarding operations, maintenance, servicing, repair and
   replacement of an asset hence saving labour-intensive asset inventory,
   time and money, and preventing the wastage of unnecessary tools
   acquisition.},

Abstract = {A steady shift in the value added from building information modelling

   evidence from a case study that transverses client and project team
   perspectives, this exploratory paper identifies missing links in the AEC
   and FM interface. The study describes the issues surrounding the
   collection and harmonization of BIM data inputs (as-built deliverables
   at handover) and the identification of (and connection to) FM data
   outputs. With the limitation of an exploratory and interpretive case
   study, the intention is to provide a contribution to academics and

Title = {The Role of Embodied Carbon Databases in the Accuracy of Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) Calculations for the Embodied Carbon of Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Studies conducted by major national and international scientific bodies
   have indisputably concluded that the increase in anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) since the mid-20th century has led to
   irreversible changes in the climate. Data has shown that the
   contribution of the building sector accounts for 39\% of these
   emissions. Reducing GHG emissions associated with the construction phase
   of buildings, or embodied carbon (EC), will prevent GHG emissions from
   entering the atmosphere earlier, reducing the negative impacts. However,
   to achieve any meaningful reduction, there is a need for consistency and
   accuracy in the calculations. The accuracy of these calculations is
   primarily tied to the accuracy of embodied carbon factors (ECF) used in
   the calculations, values determining the environmental impact of a
   product or procedure per unit weight. The emissions of any product can
   be calculated by performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). While the
   requirements for carrying out an LCA have been standardised in ISO14044,
   the lack of a definitive national ECF database in the UK means that EC
   calculations can vary drastically based on the chosen database. An LCA
   has been carried out on a standard Lidl supermarket design within the
   A1-A3 boundary. For the calculation, the ECFs were sourced from two
   different databases, using the GHG conversion factor data published in
   2020 by the UK Department of Energy \& Climate Change and data published
   in 2019 by the Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE). The latter is
   currently accepted as the most consistent database for carbon factors in
   the UK. This study showed that using a more detailed database compared
   to using a more general database could result in a 35.2\% reduction of
   embodied carbon, while using more detailed data from a single database
   can reduce it by a further 5.5\%. It is necessary to establish the most
   accurate baseline for embodied carbon so that any carbon reduction
   attempts can be as effective as possible.},

   improve the network secondary communication, qualified support comes
   from the legacy of information studies, which have developed the ability
   to extrapolate the information elements from heterogeneous information
   materials of different nature, to reorganise these elements in complex
   value added and dynamic systems and proactively to disseminate and
   communicate the results into a knowledge process. Internet referral is
   not a static thing but a life-cycle process, it requires building a

Abstract = {The contribution of the construction industry towards the development of
   the economy of an economy is inevitable. Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) is an emerging information tool that supports interface management
   in construction projects based on intellectual digital illustration that
   provides a maximum number of benefits throughout the lifecycle of
   projects. A country like India has recently adopted the BIM tool, but it
   is not widely adopted by construction companies. Therefore,
   comprehensive and systematic analyses are essential for determining the
   factors influencing BIM adoption. In this study, a proposed model is
   employed using seven significant factors, namely, Organizational support
   (OS), Information Quality (IQ), System Quality (SQ), Service Quality
   (SRQ), usage (U), User Satisfaction (US), and Net Benefits (NB), to
   analyse the influence of these factors on BIM adoption. An experimental
   analysis was conducted based on the developed success model and the
   fitness of the model was estimated. The results of this model suggest
   that system quality plays a major role in BIM usage. Furthermore, a
   hypothesis test was performed to analyse the impact range of each
   independent factor over the dependent factors.},

Abstract = {There is a demand on the current markets of industrialized house
   building for higher product design flexibility and customization. One of
   the success factors in addressing this challenge efficiently is the
   formalization and use of product platforms through information
   technology applications. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how
   product platforms and their use should be modeled to support the
   development of information technology applications. The aim of this
   paper is therefore, to increase the knowledge on information modeling of
   product platforms and their use in the industrialized house building
   design process. The available information modeling methods were
   identified and analyzed using literature review while considering the
   contextual criteria of industrialized house building. An information
   modelling method for product platforms and their use in the
   industrialized house building design process is proposed. The
   information modeling rationale is synthesized using the design platform
   modeling and the information delivery manual modeling. The former is a
   PLM-oriented while the latter is a BIM-oriented information modeling
   method. The proposed information modeling method is composed of three
   parts: product platform information model, process maps and exchange
   requirement specification. Future work should aim for the validation of
   the proposed information modeling method by application on empirical
   data in a case study.},

Abstract = {The study aims to develop an effective BIM-project information
   management framework (BIM-PIMF) and associated assessment model for
   construction projects with a view to enhancing the functional management
   of project information. An explanatory case study technique and case
   study evidence from four BIM construction projects form the study's
   research design. The study identified and established the three
   sub-criteria of the BIM-PIMF model which are the BIM process level
   factors, BIM product level factors, and the key indicators for a
   successful BIM deployment on construction project sites. These criterias
   were semantically linked to the development of the BIM-PIMF framework on
   a five-point metric scale. The deliverables of this study include the
   development of the BIM-PIMF framework, together with its analytical
   scoring system. The findings of the study will improve the information
   channels of and ease the integration of technological innovations in
   construction processes while improving the technical competencies of
   project staff. The study highlighted a basket of effective
   recommendations and strategies to enhance the deployment of BIM
   throughout a project lifecycle. Policymakers and government departments
   can utilize the model in assessing the level of usage of BIM in a
   construction project as one of the useful measures in gauging which

Abstract = {This paper focuses on how to make standards more usable and more
   valuable to key stakeholders over all life-cycle phases and in all
   sectors of the built environment. There is a need within the marketplace
   for well-established financial and economic evaluation tools both for
   traditional applications and for emerging trends-sustainability,
   Building Information Modeling, and other innovations-as they are
   mainstreamed into the built environment. The suite of standards from
   ASTM International's Subcommittee E06.81 on Building Economics fills
   that need. Specifically, these standards provide a full spectrum of
   value-enabling solutions to (1) accelerate the adoption of new building
   technologies and processes; (2) assist the evaluation of new energy
   efficiency and sustainability techniques; and (3) enhance the resource
   productivity of labor, materials, and energy. Taken together, these
   solutions can result in significant increases in efficiency and
   costeffectiveness in the built environment. The standards also provide a
   framework that facilitates communication among key stakeholders,
   increasing the potential for identifying and implementing mutually
   beneficial solutions to complex problems. A series of case studies
   involving existing and new buildings and industrial facilities are used
   to illustrate how ASTM E06.81 standards can be applied. The case studies
   also serve to illustrate a sequence of steps that, if pursued, deliver
   greater value to key stakeholders. These steps involve (1) clarifying
   the capabilities of the E06.81 standards and simplifying presentation
   materials on how to apply ASTM E06.81 standards and (2) reaching and
   informing a wider audience by engaging stakeholders outside of the
   engineering community.},

Title = {Blockchain-Enabled City Information Modeling Framework for Urban Asset
   Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Object-based modeling has become an integral and more preferred design
   approach as against two-dimensional (2D) design representation. This is
   evident in the increased use of building information modeling (BIM) for
   building design and city information modeling (CIM) for city planning
   and development. However, the development and management of object-based
   city models are often siloed and do not coexist in a virtual
   environment. Urban infrastructure is often designed in isolation, yet it
   forms part of an integrated network of assets in real life. Blockchain
   is one of several technologies that has been integrated with BIM because
   of its transparent and tamper-proof features. This research proposes a
   framework for the lifecycle management of buildings and other urban
   assets by integrating blockchain technology (BCT) into a heterogenous
   CIM of multiowned assets using a nested, multilevel data environment.
   First, the BIM is synchronized into a GIS scene for geospecificity, then
   the BIM metadata is written onto a blockchain protocol distributing the
   model information across a network of project collaborators using a
   common data environment (CDE). The resultant CIM is then shared through
   an outer layered city level CDE. Use case scenarios are presented to
   validate the functionality of the proposed approach, and research
   limitations are discussed. The framework enables the critical
   interproject or interasset communication which is otherwise impossible
   in traditional approaches where individual assets are designed as
   stand-alone models.
   Nowadays, nearly every physical product pre-exists in digital form for
   purposes of design, testing, and optimizing the product before its
   creation. This research argues that the city can also exist in digital
   form beyond a mere representation of its geometry, but encompassing the
   intangible information flow that exists between physical assets in real
   cities. This study proposes using City Information Modeling (CIM) that
   is enabled through blockchain technology (BCT) to record all activities
   concerning physical assets throughout their lifecycle. This is achieved
   by harnessing the various digital models that predate the physical
   components of the city from their design stages. These records of
   activities are retrievable and easily visualized interactively. Such CIM
   models are useful to trace the origins of building parts for accurate
   asset valuation or to review the maintenance services carried out on an
   asset and its impact on the constituent parts. It also provides a real
   template to commence new design projects whereby existing surrounding
   features, which are only possible through a site visit, can now be
   considered. The study takes into consideration the multiple ownership
   structure of city assets by integrating various digital models.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the approaches providing symmetric access of all
   industrial production services to the data of business processes of the
   enterprise by building a single warehouse of heterogeneous data of a
   metallurgical production. The warehouse is a part of an automated
   statistic quality control system for the products of a metallurgical
   enterprise. The article describes an ontological storage model of data
   coming from various sources of information in the production process.
   The concept of ``a unit of production of metallurgical production{''} is
   introduced that is the connecting component of the entire production
   life cycle of a metallurgical production. The authors propose an
   ontological model of the production process, in terms of information
   flows which are formed in an enterprise at each stage of production.
   Based on the constructed ontological model, the structure of recording
   an array of information in the heterogeneous data warehouse is justified
   and formed. Heterogeneous data warehouse forms a single information
   space of the enterprise, which serves as the basis for analytical
   analysis throughout the production and decision-making process. For
   example, timely response to the deviation reasons from the given
   physical and chemical properties of the finished product.},

Abstract = {There is a lack of accurate and valid data provision during the
   construction project lifecycle, and throughout the in-use phase of
   building assets. Construction needs to adopt a new technology to support
   building assets. Due to the current limitation of construction
   technology, Blockchain can be considered a new revolution within the
   most advanced construction applications. This paper proposes a framework
   for assembling Asset Information Models (AIMs) through private
   Blockchain to allow the owners, consultants, contractors, and suppliers
   to upload and visualise the data anywhere at any time throughout the
   lifecycle of the building to support project owners in making decisions.
   This paper introduces a conceptual framework through the processes of
   data analysis between the construction stages. The framework will
   improve current management efficiency in many ways such as: model
   upload/download, lack of data, partial model exchange, clash detection,
   conflict resolution, multiple data model formats, and data security.
   This helps project owners and maintenance teams to enhance their
   decision-making processes and improve the trust between stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Dynamic simulation models are widely utilized to evaluate complex
   technical components and systems like electric drives or machines. They
   can support the development process of a production machine by avoiding
   an inadequate layout of components or an erroneous control design.
   However, the effort for building them is often too high for this purpose
   (lot size one). An automated model generation can be utilized to
   overcome the gap between efforts and advantages of dynamic simulations.
   This contribution presents an approach for simplifying the dynamic model
   generation of production machines by using the so-called Asset
   Administration Shell defined by the initiative Platform Industrie 4.0.
   The Asset Administration Shell was developed to aggregate all data
   necessary for maintaining the product across its life cycle. This
   includes component data and models as well as structural information
   about a machine. The generation process is performed by using the common
   FMI standard and a two-step procedure which allows the linkage of
   different simulation tools. The model generation is demonstrated by an
   example layout of a machine's internal direct current grid.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of building
   information modelling (BIM) for asset management. It will discuss what
   tools and processors are used for applying BIM for asset management in
   construction projects. The method comprises a literature review of 33
   projects that have applied BIM or planned to apply BIM for asset
   management functions. The findings show that a combination of software,
   hardware, processors, and standards can enable the BIM models to be
   integrated with the asset management systems. It facilitates easy
   extraction of information, avoid errors and duplication of work. The
   most popular way of developing a BIM-based asset management system is
   incorporating BIM asset data with CMMS or CAFM systems used for asset
   lifecycle and maintenance management. Engagement of stakeholders related
   to the operation phase is required as early as possible. Consideration
   should be given for protecting the information generated within the
   cyber environment. The research shows how BIM related tools and
   processors could be integrated to successfully implement BIM enabled
   asset management. The knowledge can be potentially useful for planning
   or implementing BIM enabled asset management systems. The research
   provides insight on the application of BIM for asset management in
   construction projects globally.},

Title = {Freshwater consumption and domestic water deprivation in LCIA:
   revisiting the characterization of human health impacts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {740-754},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Purpose An insufficient amount of available domestic water can lead to
   an increase in the occurrence of water-related diseases. No LCIA
   consensus has been reached on how to model the potential impacts on
   human health resulting from water use implying domestic water
   deprivation. Building on Boulay et al. (2011), this research work
   provides an updated and revisited characterization model and factors
   assessing the potential impact on human health induced along this impact
   pathway.
   Method This work consolidates the cause-effect chain linking water use
   to domestic impacts on human health. The revised fate factor aligns
   current water use assessment methods and includes information not only
   on the physical water scarcity but also on the level of population
   access to water in a region. Building on Boulay et al. (2011), the
   global effect factor is revised. The data source is updated, and a novel
   approach is developed estimating the domestic water deficit.
   Country-scale exposure factors are updated, building on Boulay et al.
   (2011)'s proposal to rely on the gross national income per capita as a
   proxy for a country's capacity to adapt to water shortages.
   Results and discussion Compared to Boulay et al. (2011), the revised
   fate and exposure factors show lower values as a result of different
   methodological choices and of the overall increase of GNI per capita,
   respectively. The revised value of the effect factor is equal to
   3.13E-3DALY/m3 which compares to the value of 3.11E-3 in Boulay et al.
   (2011). Revised characterization factors (CF) range from 0 DALY/m3 (the
   potential impact on human health due to water use is null with respect
   to domestic water deprivation) to 3.13E-3 DALY/m3. The distribution of
   the new CFs shows an order of magnitude decrease compared to the
   previous model. These CFs assess the consequences on human health
   induced by water use leading to short-term water deprivation.
   Conclusion and recommendations This research work helps to better
   account for the impacts of water use at the endpoint level. However, it
   underlines significant limitations in the current calculation of the
   effect factor, in particular regarding current quantification of
   domestic water deprivation. These shortcomings prevent the model from
   considering a difference in vulnerability to health damages from the
   deprivation of 1 m(3) of domestic water. This research work argues for
   additional research efforts aimed at developing an alternative
   calculation method for this factor.},

Title = {BIM for FM Developing information requirements to support facilities
   management systems},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5/6},
Pages = {378-394},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to identify a generic set of information
   requirements for facilities management (FM) systems, which should be
   included in BIM as-built models for efficient information exchange
   between BIM and FM systems, and to propose a process to identify, verify
   and collect the required information for use in FM systems during the
   project's lifecycle. Design/methodology/approach Both qualitative and
   quantitative approaches were applied at different stages of the study's
   sequential design. The collection and analysis of qualitative data was
   based on an extensive literature review of similar studies, standards,
   best practices and case study documentation. This was followed by a
   questionnaire survey of 191 FM practitioners in the UK. This formed the
   background of the third stage, which was the development of the
   information management process to streamline information exchange
   between building information models and FM systems. Findings The study
   identifies a generic list of information requirements of building
   information models to support FM systems. In addition, the study
   presents an information management process that generates a specific
   database for FM systems using an open data format. Originality/value The
   existing literature focuses on specific building types (educational
   buildings) or specific information requirements related to particular
   systems (mechanical systems). The existing standards, guidelines and
   best practices focus on the information requirements to support the
   operations and maintenance (O\&M) phase in general. This study is
   different from previous studies because it develops a set of specific
   information requirements for building information models to support FM
   systems. FM organisations and owners can use the proposed list of
   information requirements as a base to generate specific data output for
   their FM systems' input, to decrease the redundant activity of manual
   data entry and focus their efforts on key activities.},

Abstract = {Understanding gas turbine design at a system level presents a difficult
   challenge. Accurate predictions of gas turbine behaviour before whole
   engine tests are completed are invaluable in preventing costly design
   changes in the latter stages of the design life cycle. In this study a
   high fidelity whole engine model has been built - specifically, a
   thermally enabled structural model. This model can predict component
   displacements up to system level interactions across the whole engine.
   Knowledge from such a model can feed into multiple design areas
   contributing to performance, component design and structural
   understanding but can also be used to influence physical testing.
   There are clear benefits in building such high fidelity models but also
   many challenges that need to be addressed, namely solver type, geometry
   interrogation, meshing, solver capability, computational power and
   finally, processing and validation of output data. Additionally,
   different applications have been used for thermal and structural
   modelling in order to utilise best capabilities in thermal and contact
   modelling but also enable scalability on high performance computing.
   However, utilising two different solvers involves meshes being tailored
   for each solver type but also introduces additional complexity of
   transferring information between the two models used.
   The paper will discuss the challenges and analysis methodologies used to
   thermally solve the whole engine cycle, the mapping procedure to
   translate thermal data to a structural model, and the approach taken to
   solve the very large simulation model explicitly at a chosen condition
   to a pseudo-steady state. In order to validate the simulation results, a
   vast amount of time has been spent to compare the results to existing
   test data.
   As model validation is a significant step in simulation to gain
   credibility of the results, a comparison of the predicted component
   displacements will be shown to X-ray data from a whole engine test.
   Results and limitations of this testing capability such as influence of
   engine vibration, shutter speed and noise in the data will be discussed
   and recommendations provided to improve accuracy of the results.},

Title = {Immersive Technology and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for
   Sustainable Smart Cities},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research currently focuses on immersive technologies like virtual
   reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). However,
   there is limited exploration of their application in sustainable smart
   cities with Building Information Modeling (BIM), and there remains a
   lack of interdisciplinary integration within this domain aimed at
   fostering sustainable smart city development. Therefore, this paper aims
   to explore the development status of immersive technology and BIM in
   sustainable smart cities, identifying trends and research hotspots by
   employing a triangulation research method mixed with a quantitative
   method via bibliometric analysis and a qualitative method via content
   analysis to investigate the relationship between immersive technologies
   and BIM in sustainable smart cities. The results reveal a fragmented
   nature in the research on immersive technology and BIM in sustainable
   smart cities, with rapidly changing hotspots and new technologies
   following a cyclical pattern every 3 to 5 years. Two distinct cycles of
   growth were observed in the field over the last 10 years (2014-2023).
   The first cycle, from 2014 to 2017, represented modest growth, while the
   second cycle, from 2018 to 2022, showed rapid expansion, with the
   keywords AR, VR, MR, BIM, smart city, and smart city concept indicating
   the research hotspots. Immersive technologies and BIM, developed since
   2017, have contributed to sustainable smart city construction. The
   emerging keywords AR, MR, and 360-degree VR have become research
   hotspots since 2021, particularly in collaborative construction. Future
   research trends include artificial intelligence, digitalization, AR, and
   MR, while building sustainability and intelligent construction have
   emerged as real-world applications. Additionally, this paper employs
   software tools to generate multidimensional knowledge maps to form a
   knowledge universe map at a ``macro-knowledge{''} level followed by a
   ``micro-knowledge{''} level comprising a standard knowledge system, such
   as lifecycle analysis, enhancing the objectivity and organization of the
   results and providing innovative references for future research.},

   generation, and runtime instrumentation. Emphasis is placed on
   integration of tools developed by multiple institutions via standardized
   interface format definitions in XML. All aspects of an embedded
   real-time system are captured in domain-specific models, including
   software components and architecture, timing and resource constraints,
   processes and threads, execution platforms, etc. Configuration code
   generation allows automated building of the application executable.
   Instrumentation of the application running on a target platform is used
   to collect runtime statistics that are fedback into the models. Analysis
   tools perform various static analyses based on the models, including
   system-level dependency analysis, execution-rate assignment to component
   ports, real-time and schedulability analysis, and automated allocation
   of components to processors. By capturing all relevant information
   explicitly in models at the design level, and performing analysis that
   provides insight into non-functional aspects of the system, we can raise
   the level of abstraction for the designer, and facilitate rapid system
   prototyping.},

Abstract = {To date, most considerations for the impact of carbon emissions in the
   built environment directly relate to building operations. However, in
   most major projects it takes approximately 20 years of operational life
   before operational carbon exceeds the carbon embodied in the original
   construction. Minimum acceptance goals for implementation must then be
   created to encourage a responsible approach to environmental design-one
   that accounts for carbon emissions from groundbreaking through the
   building's service life. A tall building, at the time of construction,
   has a large impact on the environment through the production of building
   components, delivery, and construction as well as considering life-cycle
   in areas of abnormal loading (i.e., seismicity). SOM has developed an
   advanced algorithm called the Environmental Analysis Tool that evaluates
   embodied carbon as well as cost benefits of enhanced seismic force
   resisting systems in buildings and infrastructures. An evaluation of
   embodied carbon in over 200 built structures has revealed trends and
   correlations among common design parameters such as building height,
   occupancy type, seismic and wind conditions. This information can be
   utilized to set design goals and to provide standards for the reduction
   of embodied carbon through high performance seismic systems such as
   seismic isolation and pin-fuse devices, as well as ideas including
   Sustainable Form-Inclusion Systems (SFIS). Finally, an advanced
   parametric model has been created for new and existing urban
   developments. The Parametric City Model (PCM) will be used to illustrate
   the effects of material, construction, and urban density on the
   environment. Specific national and international tall building examples
   will be discussed. Buildings will include many of the tallest to date,
   including the Burj Khalifa, Dubai. These projects amongst others will be
   used as a basis to develop standards for design and construction for
   embodied carbon in structures. It is the hope that these requirements
   would eventually become standards for the industry.},

Abstract = {The use of building information modelling (BIM) in construction projects
   is expanding, and its usability throughout building lifecycles, from
   planning and construction to operation and maintenance, is gaining
   increasing proof. In the design of domestic drinking-water and sewerage
   systems (DDWSSs), BIM focuses on coordinating disciplines and their
   design. Despite studies promoting BIM environments for DDWSSs that take
   into account the regulatory frameworks of corresponding countries, these
   efforts do not include the use of parametric tools that enhance the
   efficiency of the design process. Therefore, engineers still use
   conventional 2D design, which requires many rounds of iteration, and
   manual work is also generally still used. In this research, we developed
   and validated an intuitive methodology for solving a specific DDWSS
   problem, using a design science research method (DSRM) as an applied
   science approach. This was addressed by developing an artefact and
   validating it through two case studies. The obtained solution combines
   BIM models and parametric tools to automate the manual activities of the
   traditional design method. This article aims to bring abstract BIM
   concepts into practice and encourage researchers and engineers to adopt
   BIM for DDWSSs.},

Abstract = {The integration of building information modeling (BIM) and virtual
   reality (VR) has attracted increasing attention in the architecture
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Despite the rapid emergence
   of BIM-based VR applications, no evaluation framework specialized for
   the technologies exists in the AEC industry. After extensively reviewing
   existing studies and interviewing experts, the research team proposed an
   evaluation framework for BIM-based VR applications, which consists of 3
   stages, 5 areas, 14 criteria, and 29 metrics and focuses on the design
   phase of the projects. To assess the usefulness of the framework, the
   team applied it to five BIM-based VR applications using a BIM-based
   design project for an educational building in Hong Kong. The team also
   interviewed experts to discuss the comprehensiveness of the framework.
   The results show that the framework provides consistent results for
   comprehensive evaluation criteria and metrics in a quantitative and
   flexible manner. Further research that considers additional criteria
   and/or metrics related to other phases (e.g. construction phase) is
   required to extend the framework to the whole lifecycle.},

Abstract = {Digital building information is important during a building's lifecycle,
   it is needed from first design until demolition. The two domains that
   mainly contribute are AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction)
   during design, construction, and operation, and GIS as a supporting
   discipline for analysis and further integration of the building's
   environment. However, there is a challenge in information exchange
   between the two domains, resulting in the remodeling of digital building
   information in GIS. In this article, we identify three major data
   sources from the AEC domain and show transformation processes to enable
   the integration of such models into the geographical environment in the
   form of one transition model. Furthermore, we show that this model can
   either be used directly or exported in the form of de facto standards
   that allow for further analysis.},

Abstract = {The adoption and structuring of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   currently one of the main goals of many Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) companies, but this scenario is still vulnerable due
   to the numerous simultaneous challenges related to technology, processes
   and culture. This promotes a sometimes wordy environment when developing
   the fundamental goal, definitions, steps, and attack plans for
   implementing BIM. Due to these circumstances, this study proposes an
   approach to assess readiness and maturity models aligned with the
   organization's strategic perspectives, discussing aspects of
   performance, applicability and usability. This work was developed from a
   systematic literature review of maturity models in 4 databases based on
   the ProKnow-C method. Its bibliometric analysis resulted in the
   selection of 23 articles, in which it was possible to evaluate 22 BIM
   maturity models and analyze them according to the structure of basic
   design principles supported by a descriptive and prescriptive purpose of
   use. Therefore, it is hoped that this research will allow companies in a
   simplified way to identify the maturity model that best fits the stage
   of the building's lifecycle in which it is inserted, supporting it in
   assessment as a contribution to the beginning of the digital
   transformation journey.},

Title = {BIM-Supported Knowledge Management: Potentials and Expectations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is currently a prevalent term for a
   new way of managing the design, construction, operation, and maintenance
   (O\&M) of a project. It is regarded as an accumulation of information
   about a building anchored to a model. Consequently, BIM has been widely
   applied to manage information in construction projects. On the other
   hand, knowledge integrates context, experience, rules, and capability,
   which is at a higher level than information. Knowledge has also been
   widely recognized as one of the most important factors in construction
   projects. Therefore, close attention should be paid to knowledge
   management (KM) in construction projects. Compared to traditional
   information technology (IT) systems, BIM is characterized by
   object-oriented and parameter-driven modeling. How these characteristics
   can improve KM is a matter that has not been fully explored. To bridge
   the knowledge gap, this study first explores the existing tools used for
   KM in construction projects. Following this, the potentials of BIM for
   the improvement of KM are identified and the expectations for
   BIM-supported KM are outlined. A total of 30 industrial experts in the
   UK and Ireland were interviewed as the main research method in this
   study. Based on the analysis of interview results, a conceptual model is
   developed for BIM-supported KM. The conceptual model presents the
   features of BIM, such as three-dimensional (3D) visualization, lifecycle
   management, collaborative environment, and proactive mechanism, which
   can improve various KM activities. This study not only reveals the role
   of BIM for KM, but also gives insights into an innovative way of
   managing knowledge in construction projects.},

Title = {An ontology-based approach supporting holistic structural design with

Journal = {ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE},

Abstract = {Early stage decision-making for structural design critically influences
   the overall cost and environmental performance of buildings and
   infrastructure. However, the current approach often fails to consider
   the multi-perspectives of structural design, such as safety,
   environmental issues and cost in a comprehensive way. This paper
   presents a holistic approach based on knowledge processing (ontology) to
   facilitate a smarter decision-making process for early design stage by
   informing designers of the environmental impact and cost along with
   safety considerations. The approach can give a reasoning based
   quantitative understanding of how the design alternatives using
   different concrete materials can affect the ultimate overall
   performance. Embodied CO2 and cost are both considered along with safety
   criteria as indicative multi-perspectives to demonstrate the novelty of
   the approach. A case study of a concrete structural frame is used to
   explain how the proposed method can be used by structural designers when
   taking multi performance criteria into account. The major contribution
   of the paper lies on the creation of a holistic knowledge base which
   links through different knowledge across sectors to enable the
   structural engineer to come up with much more comprehensive decisions
   instead of individual single objective targeted delivery. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and prefabricated construction (PC)
   are increasingly applied in the construction industry. Recent academic
   and industrial efforts indicated that the application of BIM and PC is a
   solution to reduce lifecycle costs, reduce waste, increase productivity
   and improve quality in construction. Although previous studies have
   advanced the integration of BIM and PC, extensive research scope and
   scattered research topics cannot form an overall picture of knowledge
   structure. Hence, this study aims to establish an up-to-date synthesis
   of the latest research on BIM for PC and identify the research gaps and
   future needs. First, a database with 103 journal articles on BIM for PC
   was established through data collection; second, a bibliometric analysis
   was applied to determine the top journals, articles and to map the
   latest mainstream research. Last, a qualitative analysis was used to
   determine the mainstream research areas and identify the research gaps
   and future needs. This study may contribute to enrich our body of
   knowledge on the use of the techniques in conjunction, help researchers
   and builders to understand the latest progress of BIM for PC research in
   timely fashion, and promote the integration of BIM with PC and other
   cutting-edge technologies moving forward.},

Abstract = {Asset management of healthcare facilities utilizes technical and
   administrative strategies to extend the asset life cycle. This research
   aims to develop an asset condition assessment (ACA) model for a
   healthcare facility to predict and assess critical asset ratings
   considering various factors, especially patient risk space groups, and
   asset redundancy. Two modelling techniques were used to develop the ACA
   model. First, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate
   the weighting criteria and ranking the factors. Second, the AHP and
   regression analysis techniques were combined into a single model to
   evaluate healthcare facilities' asset condition assessment. The
   integrated model was validated with 88.32\% average validity percent
   (AVP). The model was determined to be robust, and its results
   satisfactory. Finally, this research developed a numerical asset
   condition assessment (ACA) critical rating scale, which can guide
   capital renewals leaders in predicting and managing healthcare
   facilities' critical infrastructure needs. Ultimately, this tool can be
   used to improve the asset management of healthcare facilities, which is
   one of the nation's largest infrastructure sectors.},

Title = {A BIM-enabled information infrastructure for building energy Fault
   Detection and Diagnostics},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Volume = {44},
Pages = {197-211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Although energy-efficient building technologies are emerging, a key
   challenge is how to effectively maintain building energy performance
   over the evolving lifecycle of the building. Field experience shows that
   energy savings of 5-30\% are typically achievable simply by applying
   energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults
   diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging
   task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because
   the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex
   and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly,
   creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD
   is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has
   its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the
   existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically
   challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the
   information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple
   functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient
   and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to
   flow among an as-built building static information module, a building
   energy performance simulation module, a building operational data
   acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is
   challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this
   paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled
   information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information
   exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the
   efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information
   infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD
   case study. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Opportunities for enhanced lean construction management using Internet
   of Things standards},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {86-97},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Traditionally, production control on construction sites has been
   challenging, and still remains challenging. The ad-hoc production
   control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal,
   foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean
   construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially
   tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making
   process and having them report back to the production management system.
   However, such systems have relatively long ``lookahead{''} planning
   cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of
   construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New
   solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again
   these types of construction management systems require the proximity and
   availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the
   authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such
   construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully
   or partially automate various communication functions across the
   construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to
   real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the
   present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and
   related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then
   provides first insights - through various construction scenarios into
   how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various
   actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management
   to the management of the entire building lifecycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Product Architecture Model for Multistory Modular Buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {142},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The modular building construction method is the industry's effort for
   industrialization of building construction. Similar to other types of
   production, a product information model is required for lifecycle
   information management of modular buildings. In this research, the
   mutual hierarchy of typical multistory modular systems is identified and
   represented in a product architecture model (PAM). This provides the
   industry with an information model required for industrial design of
   this type of construction. Since modular construction is neither as
   heavily project-based as conventional construction methods nor as
   significantly mass-produced as manufactured products, none of the
   current information management frameworks in manufacturing and
   construction industries are necessarily capable of addressing the needs
   of such projects. In the research reported here, this need is addressed
   by development of a product PAM for the most conventional modular
   systems. The PAM represents the hierarchy of modular building components
   along with their interactions, functionality, and attributes. This paper
   initially reviews major types of modular systems, and then focuses on
   the development methodology, validation, architecture, and content of
   the PAM. This is followed by an explanation of its different uses,
   including extension of the current construction industry's information
   management frameworks and platforms such as building information
   modeling (BIM) to support modular construction and providing a basis for
   product-base design of such buildings.},

Title = {Perceived benefits and issues associated with COBie datasheet handling
   in the construction industry},
Journal = {FACILITIES},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Purpose Until now, the usage and usability factors of Construction
   Operation Building information exchange (COBie) datasheet have remained
   largely overlooked. This oversight may be the potential factor in the
   lower adoption rates as well as the effective usage of COBie datasheet
   in the architecture, engineering and construction-facilities management
   industry. The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits and
   key issues associated with COBie datasheet handling and identify the key
   technological solutions, which can help in mitigating the identified
   issues. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to
   identify the key benefits of using COBie and issues, which are
   associated with COBie datasheet handling. This paper has also designed a
   questionnaire based on a literature review and surveyed professionals
   who are well versed with handling COBie datasheet. Using responses, the
   issues are analyzed and discussed using non-parametric statistical
   analysis. Findings A total of 9 key benefits and 24 key issues
   categorized under three groups of usability issues, technical issues and
   organizational/other issues were identified. The results from the survey
   agree with all the key issues associated with COBie datasheet handling
   (with 86 responses). This research also proposes key ideas, that can
   help in mitigating these issues. Originality/value There is a paucity in
   published literature, which discusses in detail about the various issues
   associated with COBie datasheet handling. This research study aims to
   address this gap by identifying key issues by looking at the entire
   COBie data-capturing process holistically. Finding from this study can
   help professionals to understand these issues and develop appropriate
   technological solutions, which can make COBie data capturing and
   understanding easier. The findings could also assist in increasing the
   adoption rate of COBie, which could be achieved through mitigation of
   identified issues.},

Title = {Developing owner information requirements for BIM-enabled project
   delivery and asset management},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {169-183},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is emerging as a potential solution
   for facility owners to address the challenges of poor information
   fidelity, interoperability, and usability in project delivery to support
   the lifecycle of their assets' information. Despite the many benefits
   offered by BIM, its use for facility operations remains significantly
   limited. The reality is that implementing BIM in large owner
   organisations is a complex challenge. In particular, a significant
   barrier to BIM adoption for owners is the challenge of identifying and
   formalizing the information requirements needed to support model-based
   project delivery and asset management. This paper presents the results
   of a longitudinal research project that investigated two large owner
   organisations in Canada to better understand the process of developing
   and formulating BIM requirements to support the lifecycle of their
   assets. Specifically, the objectives were to formalize an iterative
   approach to the identification and characterization of owner
   requirements and to develop a conceptual framework that would relate
   digital and physical products to owner requirements and organisational
   constructs, to underpin the formalization process. As part of this
   research an array of requirements documentation were analysed,
   interviews were performed with numerous facility management personnel,
   and BIMs from four projects were analysed. A methodology is introduced
   to support a rigorous and detailed analysis of BIM requirements. The
   investigation of the owner requirements helped to develop an
   understanding of the required information content, and its alignment
   with BIM. Finally the relationships between organisational constructs,
   owner requirements, and BIM were mapped. As the construction industry
   shifts towards model-based project delivery, this research will inform
   owners about how to think about handover of digital facility models, and
   what to require in models based on their specific needs.},

Abstract = {Socialist modernist architecture in the Balkan has left a valuable
   legacy of remarkable buildings from this century, which brought a
   mixture of new experiences and local traditions. Unfortunately, after
   the 1990s, many of these buildings have been neglected, improperly
   treated, or abandoned. This paper focuses on the iconic socialist
   modernist office building ``Rilindja{''} in Prishtina, Kosovo, which was
   built in 1979. In 2010, the building envelope was changed in the name of
   revitalization, without considering the energy aspect. The study aims to
   present energy performance analysis through cost-optimal renovation
   measures of the building envelope while restoring the architectural
   values before the last renovation. Using Archicad and EcoDesigner STAR,
   a BIM model was created, and energy analysis was conducted. The findings
   indicate that eighteen proposed energy efficiency measures can achieve a
   reduction in energy consumption for heating and cooling of more than
   80\% over the life cycle period of 20 years. The comparison before and
   after renovation considering restoring and preserving the inherent
   values, while integrating energy efficiency measures was necessary, as
   there is a lack of such studies in the general literature. Finally, the
   potential of restoring the collective memory through cost-optimal
   analysis is emphasized as an approach for similar cases.},

Title = {Analysis of the Synergistic Effect of Data Analytics and Technology
   Trends in the AEC/FM Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Technological advancements focusing on effective and efficient
   information modeling, visualization, resource tracking, and
   collaboration have gained substantial traction in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry in
   the last 10 years. The use of advanced technologies has resulted in
   safer jobsites hosting more productive project teams building more
   sustainable and resilient facilities and infrastructure. Recently, the
   innovative use of data and analytical approaches has had a major
   positive effect on a variety of businesses by incorporating data-driven
   applications and approaches. However, the AEC/FM industry is still
   lagging behind many other industries in leveraging the true power of
   data. Data analytics concepts and tools integrated with emerging
   construction trends such as building information modeling (BIM) have a
   high potential to revolutionize industry practices. This paper
   consolidates the record of current efforts in the AEC/FM body of
   knowledge (BOK) and body of practice (BOP) that incorporate the use of
   Data Analytics with common Technology Trends in various Application
   Areas. Identifying common subsections of each category, a three
   dimensional evidenced taxonomy was developed that maps (1) Data
   Analytics concepts such as cloud computing and machine learning onto,
   (2) AEC/FM emerging trends such as BIM and automation, and (3) existing
   and potential AEC/FM applications such as safety and progress
   monitoring. To further expand the validity of the results and explore
   opportunities and potential, a survey with the same categorization was
   developed and distributed among industry experts. Comparing the results
   of the exploration of the BOK and the survey illustrated the popularity
   of BIM among industry practitioners and in academic research. Also,
   process efficiency and productivity improvement were the two Application
   Areas that demonstrated the most potential to benefit from the
   integration of Data Analytics and Technology Trends. Analysis of the
   survey results indicated that, with a 95\% confidence level, there is no
   statistically significant difference among the Technology Trends or
   Application Areas, as identified in the literature, that can benefit
   from Data Analytics. The results presented in this study demonstrate
   evidence of the revolutionizing power of Data Analytics in the AEC/FM
   industry.},

Title = {eTOXlab, an open source modeling framework for implementing predictive
   models in production environments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Background: Computational models based in Quantitative-Structure
   Activity Relationship (QSAR) methodologies are widely used tools for
   predicting the biological properties of new compounds. In many
   instances, such models are used as a routine in the industry (e.g. food,
   cosmetic or pharmaceutical industry) for the early assessment of the
   biological properties of new compounds. However, most of the tools
   currently available for developing QSAR models are not well suited for
   supporting the whole QSAR model life cycle in production environments.
   Results: We have developed eTOXlab; an open source modeling framework
   designed to be used at the core of a self-contained virtual machine that
   can be easily deployed in production environments, providing predictions
   as web services. eTOXlab consists on a collection of object-oriented
   Python modules with methods mapping common tasks of standard modeling
   workflows. This framework allows building and validating QSAR models as
   well as predicting the properties of new compounds using either a
   command line interface or a graphic user interface (GUI). Simple models
   can be easily generated by setting a few parameters, while more complex
   models can be implemented by overriding pieces of the original source
   code. eTOXlab benefits from the object-oriented capabilities of Python
   for providing high flexibility: any model implemented using eTOXlab
   inherits the features implemented in the parent model, like common tools
   and services or the automatic exposure of the models as prediction web
   services. The particular eTOXlab architecture as a self-contained,
   portable prediction engine allows building models with confidential
   information within corporate facilities, which can be safely exported
   and used for prediction without disclosing the structures of the
   training series.
   Conclusions: The software presented here provides full support to the
   specific needs of users that want to develop, use and maintain
   predictive models in corporate environments. The technologies used by
   eTOXlab (web services, VM, object-oriented programming) provide an
   elegant solution to common practical issues; the system can be installed
   easily in heterogeneous environments and integrates well with other
   software. Moreover, the system provides a simple and safe solution for
   building models with confidential structures that can be shared without
   disclosing sensitive information.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study presents an architectural approach for building a conceptual
   model of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The architectural
   approach is generally used to model information systems (IS) of
   enterprises and can be also used as part of a system-wide approach to
   describe other complex open systems. The paper suggests three layers and
   five levels of the AGI model. Two levels (en-tropy and process) are at
   the technological layer of AI functioning, two more levels (social and
   linguistic ones) are at the relationship layer responsible for the
   behavior of AI, and, finally, the uppermost level (actualization)
   supposes general intelligence. All the components of each upper layer
   are connected to the components of the lower layers forming the AGI
   model. The feature of the social layer is determined by the requirements
   to the subjectivity of the intellect, its ability to make decisions
   independently and be responsible for them. The task of the upper layer
   is self -identification of AGI and understanding its place. The
   hypothesis has been put forward that the limitation of the life cycle is
   an important condition for the actualization of intelligence.},

Title = {Screening LCA of torrent control structures in Austria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {129-141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this article is to find a suitable life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method to quantify the most important environmental
   burdens caused by construction processes of torrent control structures.
   To find these environmental burdens, 17 construction projects of the
   Austrian Service for Torrent and Avalanche Control (WLV) were analyzed
   using the cradle to gate with options LCA methodology (CEN,
   2013).MethodsThis article explains an LCA methodology for the product
   stage and the construction process of torrent control structures
   following existing standards. The iterative approach of LCA methodology
   (ISO, 2006a) was used to record all important processes of the system
   and to supplement missing information. The LCA methodology has been
   developed from existing standards of the construction and product
   sector. Since the production of some construction materials takes place
   locally, the generic data, for Austria, was adapted. Wood inherent
   biogenic carbon and primary energy, used as raw material, are treated as
   materials inherent properties (CEN, 2014). The contribution of the
   various processes was reproduced by hotspot.Results and
   discussionHotspots of the different stages are related to the
   construction materials used. The emissions and primary energy inputs in
   the product stage are clearly dominated by concrete and steel. If these
   two materials are used sparingly, the focus is on machine application
   and transportation. Depending on the selected scenarios, the smallest
   share of emissions, in relation to the total result of product and
   construction stage emitted by transport, is 3\% and the maximum share is
   69\%. The greatest environmental impacts in the construction stage are
   caused by excavation work and transportation on-site. With an average of
   4\% in the construction stage, the transport of workers to the
   construction site cannot be neglected as is done in the building
   sector.ConclusionsThe conclusion of this study is that existing LCA
   models can be adapted to protective structures. In contrast to
   conventional buildings, the construction process and transportation are
   much more important and cannot be neglected. Shifting the hotspots to
   these processes requires specific calculation rules for that particular
   field. There is still a need for research to find a suitable functional
   unit and to develop a methodology for the use and end of life stage of
   these structures.},

Title = {Substructural Time-Varying Parameter Identification Using Wavelet
   Multiresolution Approximation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {138},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Identifying properties of civil engineering structures is an important
   task for their condition assessment, damage diagnosis, maintenance and
   repair, and life-cycle management. These structures usually contain a
   large number of degrees of freedom and exhibit some time-varying or
   nonlinear behavior, especially under extreme excitation or when damaged.
   In this study, an offline substructure method based on wavelet
   multiresolution approximation (WMRA) is proposed for the identification
   of arbitrary time-varying parameters in a shear-beam building. Assuming
   that the possible damage location of the building can be identified a
   priori, a substructural model containing both interface and internal
   restoring forces can be formulated. The WMRA can then be used to
   approximate the time-varying damping and stiffness parameters and
   convert a time-varying parametric identification problem into a
   time-invariant coefficient estimation problem. To obtain accurate
   estimation and minimize the computational effort, Akaike's information
   criterion is used for the selection of a resolution level and the
   pruning of insignificant terms. Numerical and experimental results show
   that the proposed technique can locate and quantify the time-varying
   parameters in the substructure. The method inherits the wavelet's
   excellent capability in the approximation of arbitrary functions and
   provides a flexible approach for identifying various types of
   time-varying parameters in shear-beam buildings. DOI:

Title = {Digitizing material passport for sustainable construction projects using
   BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Several aspects hinder the application sustainability in construction
   industry. The most prominent problems are related to the conservation of
   natural resources and the generation of construction and demolition
   wastes. Previous studies indicated that these problems are due to lack
   of information available to construction projects stakeholders on the
   proper handling of building materials in their different lifecycle
   stages. This paper presents Material Passport (MP) tool that provides
   information on how to handle building materials at the construction
   stage and how to benefit from them at their end-of-life stage through
   different recovery opportunities. This tool provides three quantitative
   indicators that assess building's sustainability: 1) deconstructability
   score; 2) recovery score; and 3) environmental score. These indicators
   help stakeholders to choose more sustainable solutions to building
   elements in the initial stages of the project. The paper introduces a
   framework that incorporate MP within Building Information Modeling
   (BIM). Such incorporation automates sustainability assessment as well as
   facilitating the documentation and sharing of building's information for
   future needs. A case study of a traditional residential building is
   presented to illustrate the concept of the material passport. Also, new
   alternatives of modular building concept are presented to validate the
   sustainability indicators, allowing a comparison with traditional
   building to reach more sustainable solutions. The results reveal that
   modular buildings are preferred as expected, demonstrating the
   effectiveness of the presented tools in evaluating alternatives. The
   results also show the influence of the parameters used in calculating
   the presented indicators, such as the connection type and the material
   used. The research provides a methodology that solves the problem of the
   of insufficient information in order to achieve sustainability for
   buildings by including quantitative and qualitative information. The
   provided information covers all lifecycle stages of the building, making
   it more comprehensive compared to other tools.},

Abstract = {Building and construction information modelling for decision making
   during the life cycle of infrastructure projects are vital tools for the
   analysis of complex, integrated, multi-disciplinary systems. The
   traditional design process is cumbersome and involves significant
   manual, time-consuming preparation and analysis as well as significant
   computational resources. To ensure a seamless workflow during the design
   and analysis and to minimise the computation time, we propose a novel
   concept of multi-level numerical simulations, enabling the modelling on
   different Levels of Detail (LoDs) for each physical component, process
   information, and analysis type. In this paper, we present SATBIM, an
   integrated platform for information modelling, structural analysis and
   visualisation of the mechanised tunnelling process for design support.
   Based on a multi-level integrated parametric Tunnel Information Model,
   numerical models for each component on different LoDs are developed,
   considering proper geometric as well as material representation,
   interfaces and the representation of the construction process. Our fully
   automatic modeller for arbitrary tunnel alignments provides a high
   degree of automation for the generation, the setup and the execution of
   the simulation model, connecting the multi-level information model with
   the open-source simulation software KRATOS. The software of SATBIM is
   organized in a modular way in order to offer high flexibility not only
   for further extensions, but also for adaptation to future improvements
   of the simulation software. The SATBIM platform enables practical, yet
   flexible and user-friendly generation of the tunnel structure for
   arbitrary alignments on different LoDs, supporting the design process
   and providing an insight into soil-structure interactions during
   construction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean
   for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few
   limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs
   for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective
   of BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the
   design exist outside the BIM environment - typically in e-mail formats.
   This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste
   valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need
   of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting ``green{''}
   features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve
   varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require
   changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are
   involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive
   adequate information/education before they make decisions. This is the
   nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This
   paper builds around the design and development of an online system,
   named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building
   Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online
   social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to
   building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it
   allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share
   views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic
   modeling tools are then used to extract information from these
   interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis
   software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and
   assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to
   advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental
   shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy
   makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an
   open platform, it provides access to information that enables
   researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and
   methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing
   new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a
   profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals and the society at
   large.},

Title = {Utilizing a Building Information Modelling Environment to Communicate
   the Legal Ownership of Internet of Things-Generated Data in Multi-Owned
   Buildings},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In multi-owned buildings, a community of residents live in their private
   properties while they use and share communal spaces and facilities.
   Proper management of multi-owned buildings is underpinned by rules
   related to health, safety, and security of the residents and visitors.
   Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect information about
   the livable space has become a significant trend since the introduction
   of first smart home appliances back in 2000. The question about who owns
   the IoT generated data and under what terms it can be shared with others
   is still unclear. IoT devices, such as security camera and occupancy
   sensors, can provide safety for their owners, while these devices may
   capture private data from the neighborhood. In fact, the residents are
   sometimes not aware of regulations that can prevent them from installing
   and collecting data from shared spaces that could breach other
   individuals' privacy. On the other hand, Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) provides a rich 3D digital data environment to manage the
   physical, functional, and ownership aspects of buildings over their
   entire lifecycle. This study aims to propose a methodology to utilize
   BIM for defining the legal ownership of the IoT generated data. A case
   study has been used to discuss key challenges related to the ownership
   of IoT data in a multi-owned building. This study confirmed that BIM
   environment can facilitate the understanding of legal ownership of IoT
   datasets and supports the interpretation of who has the entitlement to
   use the IoT datasets in multi-owned buildings.},

Title = {Living labs as an opportunity for experiential learning in building
   engineering education},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building performance - spanning energy use, greenhouse gas emissions,
   indoor environmental quality, etc. - is fundamental to the field of
   building engineering, yet it is typically taught with idealistic
   assumptions and traditional, teacher-centred, lecture-based methods. A
   promising emerging approach for university-level building engineering
   education is experiential learning, whereby students actively engage in
   complex tasks with real building data that reflect the kinds of problems
   graduates are likely to encounter in the workplace. To bridge the
   academic and employability skills and knowledge that they are developing
   through these tasks, students participate in reflective activities that
   help them to articulate the relevance and implications of the experience
   for lifelong learning. The objective of this paper is to assess the
   teaching and learning effectiveness of a data-and information-centric
   experiential learning approach to university-level engineering
   education. This paper reflects upon a particular course-based initiative
   informed by experiential learning theory that engaged fourth-year
   students in the life cycle of a new building on a university campus that
   was equipped with state-of-the-art building controls technologies.
   Students were provided access to a living lab resource with diverse
   artefacts from the building: drawings and building information models,
   guest lectures and technical tours, and live/his-toric data for the
   building. A series of assignments provided students with simulated
   problem scenarios to solve through the application of the building data
   as well as reflection prompts about their problem-solving process. The
   present paper details the assignments and the nature of the living lab
   data, students' assignment results, and students and teaching
   assistants' feedback on the overall teaching approach. The findings
   indicate a significant and continuous improvement in the reception and
   perceived educational value of the experiential assignments over the
   four-month term, suggesting living labs are a promising source of
   educational material for experiential learning. The paper concludes with
   lessons learned from the current course about experiential learning in
   building engineering education that can be applied more broadly to
   future courses in the field.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling is one of the most progressive technology
   in construction industry. Building information modelling represents
   creating and data managing process in the lifecycle of buildings. This
   area is often also addressed in the scientific sphere. Several surveys
   are currently focused on the use of BIM technology. The exploitation of
   BIM technology in practice is closely interconnected with implementation
   of the BIM tool in the education process at the faculties of civil
   engineering. In education, BIM provides development of students'
   critical way of thinking and enables them to understand the complexity
   of the construction industry. This study discusses issue of BIM
   implementation in education process in Croatia and Slovakia. Aim of
   research is to give overview of BIM education process and usage of BIM
   software in field of construction management at the Technical university
   of Kosice, Faculty of civil engineering and University of Zagreb,
   Faculty of civil engineering. This comparison should be brings another
   research questions and research areas about topic of BIM in education
   process and practice. The results of the survey should point to a better
   understanding of the issues and the current state of BIM in the
   educational process in the field of construction management.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICS},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper deals with reverse engineering, namely the as-built
   documentation of actual construction. The input is data measured in the
   field using geodetic methods. In addition to modern methods of surveying
   3D objects, such as laser scanning, it is still necessary to use classic
   surveying using a total station. The bottleneck of the process is the
   creation of documentation of the construction, which is still created
   manually in the appropriate CAD/BIM software. The goal of this research
   was to find a method that would reduce the amount of manual work when
   drawing documentation in CAD/BIM to a minimum. The core of the solution
   is the use of a topology that interconnects the points measured
   in-field. The entire procedure has two parts: (1) creating a topological
   drawing template in a suitable CAD/GIS software (digital sketch) and (2)
   adding geometry to this sketch and creating a drawing using topological
   codes. This method was verified in practice by applying it to several
   specific buildings in the Czech Republic. The practical application of
   the method demonstrated 30\% time savings and a reduction in work and
   error rate in the entire process.},

Title = {A new house wall system for residential buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The residential housing sector consumes a significant amount of fossil
   fuel energy and thereby produces a large percentage of greenhouse gas
   emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. At
   present, approximately 40\% of the total household energy used is
   required for space heating/cooling and a substantial amount of that
   energy is lost through the house walls. Despite the importance of house
   walls for energy efficiency, most published literature focuses mainly on
   thermal comfort, environmental impact and economic costs of residential
   buildings. Little information is available on energy efficient house
   wall systems that can be used and adapted for varied climate conditions
   with minimal design change and associated cost. Therefore, the primary
   objective of this paper was to undertake a thermal performance study of
   two house wall systems with single and double glazed windows under
   variable climate conditions. The study was undertaken using thermal
   performance simulation software AccuRate(R). The findings indicate that
   a significant energy saving can be achieved using the new house wall
   system compared to currently used brick veneer house wall system. (C)

Title = {The interdisciplinary conceptualization of future proofing in the

Journal = {BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {7},
Pages = {810-826},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Due to constantly changing requirements, future proofing is increasingly
   seen as an urgent need in hospital building design. However, as
   knowledge on future proofing hospital building design is yet to be
   consolidated, this study reviews the literature to clarify understanding
   of the concept in hospital building contexts. A scoping review
   methodology was considered appropriate to elucidate concepts in the
   literature. As future proofing has been developed in multiple
   industries, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to investigate the
   concept across three contexts: design (in general), the built
   environment and hospital buildings. Findings reveal that most studies
   adopted a crisis-driven approach to conceptualize future proofing -
   largely limited to consideration of adaptability and resilience. By
   synthesizing the data, the research provides a comprehensive definition
   of future proofing by answering the WHY, WHAT and HOW of its application
   to hospital building design. A future proofing model is proposed that is
   composed of passive-active and reactive-proactive dichotomies that
   identify four future proofing objectives. These objectives are addressed
   via six future proofing capabilities: maintainability, resilience,
   changeability, mitigation, improvement and transition. The study
   clarifies future proofing objectives in hospital building design and
   informs directions for further research and dialogue in policy,
   research, education and practice.},

Abstract = {Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Operation and Ownership (AECOO)
   team up in a multi-disciplinary collaborative system to create buildings
   and infrastructure. The participating disciplines have reached a state
   in which traditional methods and forms of input data introduce entropy
   that compromises sustainable construction in larger projects. It became
   difficult to reach planned optimum project duration and costs this way.
   New approaches based on the systematic digitalization of the building
   lifecycle, from design to demolition, can solve the problem by involving
   the concepts of building information modeling (BIM) systems and big
   data. Previous research on BIM and big data only studied the potential
   for construction performance. In addition to extending research into
   systems' thinking and technical sustainability of big visual data, this
   paper extends our previous work in the area by introducing a new
   conceptual and technical framework for sustainable management of
   construction site big visual data.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process concerning the
   formation of digital representations of the physical and functional
   features of built spaces. A significant increase of the BIM utilization
   in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector are
   becoming more accessible and functional. The BIM methodology was
   developed in order to provide an effective system for building
   management as well as to organize the collaboration between different
   parties. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is maintained by
   buildingSMART; enable an interoperable format for exchanging BIM data
   between different software platform which is capable of restoring both
   geometric information and rich semantic information of building
   components to support lifecycle data sharing. BIM provides a detailed 3D
   geometrical model with rich semantic data. In contrast, Geography
   Information Science (GIS) offers powerful spatial analytical tools. As
   the benefits brought by the integration of Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being
   proved by many researchers, further spatial analysis can be applied that
   can benefit indoor-outdoor integrated applications. Recent research has
   mainly discussed the process required for data conversion from BIM to
   GIS. Thus, more specifics requirements on the functionalities of a 3D
   indoor applications need to be considered. In this study, the use of BIM
   IFC for 3D indoor GIS was reviewed, especially on the data conversation,
   data management, and 3D spatial analysis. The aim of this paper is to
   reveal the 3D indoor GIS requirements for space management. Therefore,
   the requirements were analyzed in four aspects: 1) data level
   integration; 2) data management; 3) 3D indoor GIS analysis; and 4) 3D
   space management. 3D space management was developed according to the
   requirement. Future research will be testing the conversion data in a
   GIS environment, the data structure for the 3D indoor GIS will be
   designed and a prototype will be developed to demonstrate the spatial
   analysis functionalities for 3D space management.},

Abstract = {Many of the shortcomings associated with dated design and construction
   methods as well as project fast-tracking can be addressed by exploring
   the concept of concurrency facilitated by Building Information Modelling
   (BIM). From a BIM perspective, concurrency facilitates the involvement
   of stakeholders from very early on during the lifecycle of a project.
   Leveraging the 5 W/H (Who, What, When/Where, Why and How) method of
   exploratory research, this paper explores how BIM and Concurrent
   Engineering (CE) at Terminal 3A of the Chongqing Jiangbei International
   Airport compares with a historical exemplar of BIM deployment in the AEC
   industry. Based on existing definitions of CE, we compare both projects
   to determine their conformance to three CE criteria: 1) compressed
   project duration, 2) enhanced product value, and 3) reduced project
   costs. We also review their use of collaborative tools and techniques.
   The paper shows how the success of BIM-based projects can be
   rationalised by CE.},

Abstract = {Construction projects are becoming progressively larger and more complex
   in terms of physical size and cost. Building information modeling (BIM)
   is being regarded as a revolutionary change for managing the entire
   lifecycle of a construction project. However, the information provided

   of developing the near-optimum schedule plan according to project
   objectives and project constraints for project scheduling and
   management. An automated database management system, a schedule
   simulation system, and a MD (multi-dimensional) CAD model creator
   provide a reliable platform for the proposed framework. To verify the
   concept and test the feasibility of this framework, a computer
   implementation called NDSM (N-Dimensional project Scheduling and
   Management system) was developed and implemented in a construction

Title = {Modeling Smart Grid neighborhoods with the ENERsip ontology},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {168-182},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The electricity consumption in the buildings sector has been steadily
   increasing during the last decade, up to the point that energy
   efficiency in this sector has become a major problem for governments,
   utilities, customers, and the environment. The foreseen high penetration
   of distributed micro-generation facilities based on renewables can help
   to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and households,
   although the complexity of managing effectively the electric grid
   increases dramatically under these conditions. The IEEE 2030 standard
   for interoperability in the Smart Grid remarks upon the importance of
   well-defined data models in such complex scenarios and puts emphasis on
   the benefits of ontologies and OWL (Web Ontology Language) for this
   purpose. This paper presents an OWL-based ontology that formally defines
   the vocabulary and taxonomy and captures the engineering and business
   semantics of this domain of knowledge (i.e., energy efficiency in the
   so-called nZEN - nearly Zero-Energy Neighborhoods). This ontology has
   been defined under the scope of the EU (European Union) research project
   ENERsip. The paper also highlights the main benefits the ontology
   brought to all the phases of the project life cycle, as well as how
   future work can make the most out of it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Tall and slender buildings often endure disturbances resulting from
   winds composed of various mean and fluctuating velocities. These
   disturbances result in discomfort for the occupants as well as
   accelerated fatigue life cycles and premature fatigue failures in the
   building. This work presents the development of a smart morphing facade
   (Smorphacade) system that dynamically alters a buildings' external shape
   or texture to minimize the effect of wind-induced vibrations on the
   building. The Smorphacade system is represented in this work by a series
   of plates that vary their orientation by means of a central controller
   module. To validate the simulation, a simple NACA0012 airfoil is
   simulated in a stream of air at a Reynolds number (RE) of 2 million. The
   pressure and viscous force profiles are captured to plot the variation
   of the lift force for different angles of attack that are then validated
   using published experimental airfoil data. After validation, the airfoil
   is attached to a linear spring-damper combination and is allowed to
   translate vertically without rotation according to the force profile
   captured from the surrounding air stream. A PID controller is developed
   to equilibrate the vertical position of the airfoil by altering its
   angle of attack. The model and its utility functions are implemented as
   an OpenFOAM (R) module (MSLSoIid). Thereafter, the model is expanded to
   handle a planar case of a building floor carrying 4 controllable plates.
   The forces on the building profile are summed at the centroid of the
   building and the windward rigid body motion of the floor is estimated by
   reflecting the horizontal force component on a Finite Element (FE) model
   of the building. The time series information of the force acting on the
   building and the resulting oscillations are captured for exhaustive
   combinations of the plate angles. This data is used to build a lookup
   table that gives the best plate configuration for a given wind
   condition. A controller operates in real-time by searching the lookup
   table using readings of the wind condition. Preliminary results show a
   94\% reduction in the amplitudes of wind-induced vibrations.},

Abstract = {The planning and management of engineering systems requires the
   integration of often very large volumes of disparate information from
   numerous sources; the coupling of this information with efficient tools
   for assessment and evaluation allow broad, interactive participation in
   the planning, assessment, and decision making process; and effective
   methods of communicating results and findings to a broad audience.
   Information technology, and in particular, the integration of data base
   management systems, and multi-criteria optimization models, provide some
   of the tools for effective decision support. The objective of the
   computer based decision support system proposed in this research is to
   improve planning and management through decision making processes by
   providing useful and scientifically sound information to the actors
   involved in these processes, including public officials, planners and
   scientists, and the general public. The Multicriteria Decision Support
   System uses the Compromise programming as Decision support tool that
   involves both rather descriptive information systems as well as more
   formal normative, prescriptive optimization approaches. The case of
   building life cycle is used as an example. A simplified example is used
   revolving around a choice between alternatives. The alternatives are
   analyzed and ultimately ranked according to a number of economic and
   environmental criteria by which they can be compared; these criteria are
   checked against the objectives and constraints (our expectations),
   involving possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives.},

Abstract = {In past decades, the massive generation of construction and demolition
   waste (CDW) was increasingly threatening the public environment and
   humanity health worldwide. A large amount of research has been devoted
   to the CDW from difference perspectives. However, few scholars have
   attempted to summarize and review the extant studies, especially in the
   managerial areas of CDW (MA-CDW). This paper fills this gap via a
   systematic and quantitative review in the CDW management field.
   Employing the scientometric analysis method, a total of 261 articles
   published from 2006 to 2018 were collected to construct the knowledge
   map and comprehensive framework for MA-CDW. Results show that the
   overall evolutionary trend of MA-CDW was from basic management concepts
   to internal and external challenges analysis, to organizational strategy
   and innovative management practices. The major MA-CDW knowledge domains
   were identified and summarized into four pillars, namely: (1) factor and
   challenge; (2) composition and quantification; (3) assessment and
   comparison; and (4) technology and method. Based on the trend, knowledge
   gaps and future research directions were found out and discussed. This
   study contributes to the existing MA-CDW knowledge by presenting a
   comprehensive knowledge framework. Furthermore, these findings can
   provide the researchers and practitioners with an in-depth understanding
   for the sustainable governance of CDW.},

   Context of Metaverse},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {At present, considering the novelty of Immersive Technologies (ImTs)
   associated with Digital Twin (DT), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented
   Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) in the context of the metaverse and
   its rapid and ongoing development in Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), knowledge of specific possibilities and methods for integrating
   ImTs into building process workflows remains fragmented and scarce.
   Therefore, this paper aims to explore the research progress and trends
   of immersive technology-driven BIM applications, providing a helpful
   reference for understanding the current knowledge system and stimulating
   future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
   first attempt to use macro-quantitative bibliometric analysis and
   micro-qualitative analysis methods to explore the research topic of
   ImTs-driven BIM. This study obtains 758 related studies in the past
   decade, year 2013 to 2022, through a series of keywords from the Web of
   Science Core Collection database and uses VOSviewer software to conduct
   keywords co-occurrence analysis and overlay visualisation to visualise
   the relationship between ImTs and BIM, which contains six clusters,
   namely VR, Internet of Things (IoT), DT, 3D model, design, and AR. The
   macro-quantitative analysis on ImTs-driven BIM applications throughout
   all the stages of the building lifecycle reveals the themes, content,
   and characteristics of the applications across the stages, which tend to
   be integrated with emerging advanced technology and tools, such as
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and deep learning.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is a digital technological-change
   that aid the transformation of construction industry delivery processes
   from its traditional methods into a digitalised model full of
   information. BIM has been identified as a modern delivery technology
   that is revolutionising construction industry operation globally, with
   capacity to reduce inefficiencies, improved performance, and enhancing
   productivities through increasing collaboration and communication among
   project team throughout the project lifecycle. Despite this benefits,
   its acceptance have remain low due to lack of knowledge and skills
   required for it adoption and lack of competent BIM graduate injection to
   the industry. The paper aim at accessing the academic readiness of
   Higher Education Institution (HEIs) in Malaysia. To achieve this, the
   study first seeks industrial experts' opinions using interviews to
   evaluate their expectations from HEIs in the production of BIM competent
   workforce to the industry. Secondly the study employed an online
   questionnaire survey for HEIs' educators seeking to assess academic
   readiness for the production of employable BIM competent graduate to the
   industry. However, the paper submits that more is needed by HEIs to be
   academically ready for BIM to be integrated to HEIs academic programs.
   Also the study acknowledged that academic readiness will facilitates the
   realisation of institutional roles of the education sector of the
   industry and thus, prompting the review of curriculum to adequately take
   care of industrial needs as regards BIM competent graduate production.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how digitalization and development of critical
   literacies influence changes in entrepreneurs' information-seeking
   behavior, and how such changes in behavior directly influence the
   resource acquisition, bundling, and leveraging process, contributing to
   the development of personal and business competencies and growth.
   Building on the logic of resource-orchestration theory, this paper
   presents a systematic literature review covering 39 studies published
   between 1990 and 2020 that summarizes the current state and trends at
   the intersection of digitalization, the entrepreneurs' critical
   literacies, and information-seeking behavior. The review results reveal
   three main streams of research including (i) digitalization and
   entrepreneurs' ICT adoption, (ii) entrepreneurs and critical literacies,
   and (iii) entrepreneurs' information-seeking behavior. Based on the
   review results that reflect a fragmented status quo of entrepreneurship
   research, we develop a holistic framework and outline future research
   directions for entrepreneurship. This research expands the traditional
   boundaries of entrepreneurship research by considering the implications
   of entrepreneurs' critical literacies and their information behavior on
   resource orchestration process. The findings provide practical
   implications indicating the need to address the key challenges of
   entrepreneurs in a fast-changing and interconnected business

Abstract = {The rapid evolution of digital technologies has revolutionized the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, driving the
   wide-spread adoption of digital twins for structures. These virtual
   replicas, developed using Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology, incorporate extensive information databases, proving
   indispensable for enhancing project management throughout a structure's
   entire lifecycle and towards smart city development. As the impact of
   climate change continues to grow, hazardous weather alerts play a
   critical role as an early-warning system that notifies stakeholders of
   imminent threats, thereby influencing decision-making processes in
   construction projects. Surprisingly, despite its evident value, the
   integration of alert systems for hazardous weather conditions into BIM
   is often overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Robot Process
   Automation (RPA) protocols to automate the integration of real-time
   weather parameters into a structure's BIM models. These very protocols
   are also used as alert systems, enabling the timely notification of
   stakeholders in the event of detected hazardous weather conditions. The
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through its
   practical application in enhancing the safety of an actual building in

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a powerful technique used to calculate
   total input and output flows of materials and energy from and to the
   environment during every step of a product life. A measure of a product
   Environmental Quality (EQ) can then be derived and help in the selection
   and in the design of more environmentally friendly design alternatives.
   EQ is a multicriteria measurement. In the construction field, LCA flows
   cannot be known with precision without loss of realism. Hence intervals
   have been introduced to model them. Thus, different designs are
   characterized by interval multicriteria measures. Manipulation bf such
   environmental performances falls for a MCDA method which (1) does not
   allow for trade-offs between criteria, (2) preserves as much information
   as possible and (3) is simple enough to be understood by non-specialist
   users, PROMETHEE was identified as a suitable method according to the
   previous criteria, but it is not able to handle interval performances so
   far. We discuss the necessary changes to devise an interval version,
   called ``PROMETHEE I{''}. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Process Digitization for BIM Implementation in a Microenterprise},
Journal = {BAUINGENIEUR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {63-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information Management (BIM) seeks the structured digitization
   of all necessary data and its IT-supported use over the entire lifecycle
   of the building. The current initiatives for the development of
   guidelines for the BIM processes focus on the modeling of the
   chronological sequence and the communication on the Big-BIM scale
   without dealing with the manner of increasing the degree of digitization
   of the processes. A challenge for the German AEC sector, which is
   characterized by a relatively low digital index, is to support not
   only,individual BIM tasks but complete BIM processes through IT
   solutions.
   Such a technology change, like the BIM Method, is particularly difficult
   for microenterprises, since they have low budget and manpower for new IT
   development issues.
   This article provides an overview of digitization in the current AEC
   practice in Germany. It also reports on the existing national and
   international BIM guidelines for building processes. An exemplary use of
   the BPM methods (Business Process Management) for the IT support and the
   enhancement of the digitization of typical information processes in a
   small architecture office is presented.
   In addition, recommendations for the successful digitization of the AEC
   processes within the framework of the BIM method in Germany are named.},

Abstract = {Global companies are beginning to recognize the health, safety,
   environmental and economic benefits of resource management programs that
   lead to a position of sustainable development. As a result, many such
   companies are developing and beginning to implement design practices
   that consider environmental aspects across all life stages of their
   products (raw material acquisition, manufacturing,
   packaging/distribution, use/service, and end-of-life management). The
   Ecobilan Group's Environmental Information \& Management Explorer (EIME)
   tool was developed to enable eco-design practices in the electronics
   industry. To illustrate the utility of EIME, a case study performed by
   the Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) hiring pilot testing of the software
   is presented and discussed Pilot study experience indicates that several
   enhancements to the tool are necessary for broad use. The Ecobilan Group
   is working in partnership with Kodak and potentially other stakeholders
   to further enhance the EIME tool. Enhancements that have been identified
   include expanding the capability to model product end-of-life
   alternatives, incorporating a single-figure eco-efficiency index for
   scoring environmental performance of products, expanding the current
   life cycle inventory database, and developing connectivity between EIME
   and product data management libraries.},

Title = {Science mapping the knowledge domain of energy performance research in
   the AEC industry: A scientometric analysis},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {264},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This study aims to reveal the current state of energy performance
   research in the AEC industry and literature. The research objective is
   to identify hot topics (i.e., knowledge domain) and hot keywords (i.e.,
   knowledge base), productive countries and institutions, research gaps,
   and emerging areas in this domain (i.e., knowledge evolution). For this
   purpose, systematic bibliometric and scientometric analyses were
   performed by referring to 5489 bibliometric records published between
   1991 and 2023. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Gephi were used for performing
   scientometric analysis. The key points include (1) promoting research
   collaborations between countries and institutions, (2) uncovering gaps
   and requirements of optimizing energy performance through pre
   construction, construction as well as operation and maintenance phases,
   (3) identifying the target market for stakeholders, investors, and
   policymakers, and (4) guiding to determine the common grounds for
   international regulations and policies. Further, this study presents a
   knowledge map summarizing the prominent research results. The
   contribution is to provide a holistic comprehension of the recent
   status, hot keywords and topics, productive countries and institutions,
   research gaps, and emerging areas of energy performance. The gaps
   revealed in this study show possible future research directions,
   necessities, and the fields that should be investigated. Accordingly,
   this research would be a valuable guideline for professionals focusing
   on energy performance.},

Title = {Information Disclosure and the Diffusion of Information Security Attacks},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {565-584},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the nearly instantaneous dissemination of information in the modern
   era, policies regarding the disclosure of sensitive information have
   become the focus of significant discussion in several contexts. The
   fundamental debate centers on trade-offs inherent in disclosing
   information that society needs, but that can also be used for nefarious
   purposes. Using information security as a research context, our
   empirical study examines the adoption of software vulnerabilities by a
   population of attackers. We compare attacks based on software
   vulnerabilities disclosed through full-disclosure and limited-disclosure
   mechanisms. We find that full disclosure accelerates the diffusion of
   attacks, increases the penetration of attacks within the target
   population, and increases the risk of first attack after the
   vulnerability is reported. Interestingly, the effect of full disclosure
   is greater during periods when there are more overall vulnerabilities
   reported, indicating that attackers may strategically focus on busy
   periods when the effort of security professionals is spread across many
   vulnerabilities. Although the aggregate volume of attacks remains
   unaffected by full disclosure, attacks occur earlier in the life cycle
   of the vulnerability. Building off our theoretical insights, we discuss
   the implications of our findings in more general contexts.},

Abstract = {Information technology and its application have resulted in enormous
   development in the construction industry during the last decade. The
   main reason behind this evolution was the incorporation of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to be an inefficient construction approach.
   BIM is now globally considered to be the tool of transforming the
   construction process to new era. It is also considered as a good tool
   for the whole project lifecycle. The aim of the present study is to
   clarify how BIM can be used in after project construction within
   uncertainty and risky environment such as document losses and unrecorded
   change orders. Interviews with project team, project site photography,
   collecting the available schemes and documents were the approaches used
   in this work to re-build the projects models. The results obtained from
   this work show that the knowledge and expectations of BIM within
   existing building have an admirable achievements for construction
   industry. Furthermore, BIM approach used in this work made more progress
   in the implementation of BIM as a rehabilitation and renovation tool in
   civil projects. The conclusions from this study reflect high correlation
   between the quantities take off with what as-built constructed, more
   than the traditional approach. The glamorous lessons derived from BIM
   implementation for the case study is; working with a model in which all
   project team feel comfortable and harmonic, will ensure enough resources
   to make the model updated and ought to lead to a minimum conflict within
   the model or what traditionally called ``project documents{''}.},

Abstract = {Uncertain and lumpy demand forces capacity planners to maximize the
   profit of individual factory by simultaneously taking advantage of
   outsourcing to and/or being outsourced from its supply chain and even
   competitors. This study develops a resource-planning model of a large
   manufacturer with two profit-centered factories. The proposed model
   enables a collaborative integration for resource and demand sharing
   which is highly attractive to the high-tech industries against the
   challenges of short product life cycle, intensive capital investment and
   decreasing marginal profit. Each of the individual factories applies an
   economic resource-planning model and a genetic algorithm to improve its
   objective while purchasing extra capacity requirement from its peer
   factory or selling extra capacity of resources to the others through a
   negotiation algorithm. This study makes a contribution in successfully
   building a mutual negotiation model for a set of customer tasks to be
   realized by the negotiating parties, each with private information
   regarding company objectives, cost and price. Experimental results
   reveal that near-optimal solutions for both of the isolated (a single
   factory) and negotiation-based (between two factories) environments are
   obtained.},

   tasks},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {97},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a widely established method in
   the architecture, engineering, construction, and facilities management
   (AEC/FM) industry. Although BIM focuses on processes throughout the
   lifecycle of the built environment, the applications in the planning
   phase, e.g. the generation of construction site layouts, have not
   reached their full potential yet. One important example herein is the
   allocation and dimensioning of resources (e.g., building materials and
   equipment) which is typically carried out by humans according to clearly
   defined rules and best practices. This paper presents model-based rule
   checking for the planning of construction site layouts. We demonstrate
   that existing Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS), such as the
   open-source rule engine Drools, can be used. We combine Drools with the
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to retrieve data from a building
   information model and use the information within the rule engine. We
   define general model requirements and implement a sample set of
   prototype rules. We also introduce the concept of offset geometry for
   rules that, for example, demand a known safety distance between
   temporary construction site elements. The developed approaches are
   explained and evaluated in field-realistic, practical case studies.
   Finally, we present a discussion how the application of the developed
   rule-based system may assist human decision making in tasks such as safe
   construction sites layout planning.},

Title = {Facilitating the building commissioning process using building
   information modeling: an action-research project},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 11},
Abstract = {PurposeThe building commissioning (BCx) phase is a critical stage in a
   building's lifecycle. It is also a complex process that involves a large
   number of actors and activities. While the use of building information
   modeling (BIM) in the commissioning phase of building equipment and
   systems could be beneficial, few studies have investigated the processes
   behind its implementation. The research presented in this paper aims to
   investigate the implementation of BIM for the commissioning phase within
   a general contracting company through
   action-research.Design/methodology/approachThrough direct involvement
   with the research partner, a large general contractor, a diagnosis on
   the current limitations of the commissioning process was conducted. An
   action plan to implement BIM for commissioning was developed and
   implemented in two pilot projects. Evaluation was performed through
   on-site observations and informal discussions with field staff. Learning
   was specified through the development of a formal protocol for
   BIM-enabled BCx.FindingsThis action-research project helped the partner
   organization identify the challenges and a way forward to formalize its
   BIM-enabled BCx process. The action plan aimed at countering the lack of
   knowledge about the status of equipment and system commissioning as well
   as the lack of standardization. The research team co-developed and
   tested a formal protocol, including BIM-enabled processes and
   technologies to address these observed problems. A complete
   implementation ecosystem was structured and deployed. Preliminary
   feedback indicated that improvements were obtained using a BIM-enabled
   approach over a traditional approach.Originality/valueWhile past studies
   have investigated the BCx process, this study identified current
   challenges considering recent advances in BIM and focused on a large
   general contractor. This work provides an in-depth account of a large
   general contractor attempting to streamline its BCx process. The results
   of the study could help guide practitioners in implementing more
   streamlined BIM-enabled BCx processes.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) can significantly impact both new as
   well as existing architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) projects.
   It can provide a virtually simulated and large integrated database that
   can be leveraged not only in design and engineering, but also in
   planning and management operations, and facilities maintenance. Although
   most of the BIM tools are now mature enough to use in various phases of
   project lifecycle, they have been primitive and under-developed for many
   years. The concepts underpinning BIM have been around since the 1960s
   through various manufacturing industries such as automotive, ship
   building or aerospace. In the aerospace industry, especially in aircraft
   design and manufacturing, the concept similar to BIM is a Digital
   Mock-Up (DMU). It is both a tool and a product of engineering. As in
   BIM, aircraft's DMU is also a comprehensive digital product
   representation that is used to simulate the use, behavior and
   performance of a finished aircraft. While BIM and DMU are used for
   different industries and products, they do share similarities and
   differences. This paper briefly describes BIM and DMU technologies and
   their context, specifically focusing on implementation of these two
   technologies for operation and maintenance (O\&M).},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Construction industry is a large contributor in terms of energy
   consumption for all stages of the building life-cycle. Among building
   features, lightning management is a crucial element for energy saving.
   In this paper, an algorithm for the automatic detection of ceiling
   lightings is developed and tested. The main sections of the algorithm
   consist of ceiling extraction, point cloud to image conversion, and
   luminaires detection. Ceiling extraction is performed using RANSAC
   algorithm for plane detection. Point cloud conversion uses nearest
   neighbor rasterization and image binarization. The final step deals with
   luminaires detection and considers two types of lightning present in the
   dataset: fluorescent lightings are distinguished using a refined Harris
   corner detector while a Hough transformation is applied to find circular
   low energy bulbs.
   The algorithm results reflect a completeness of 100\% with a geometric
   accuracy of 5.8 cm in the centroid determination of fluorescent lighting
   and 3.0 cm in low energy bulbs. The computing time ranges from 148.8 s
   in the detection of the fluorescent lighting to 105.9 s for the case of
   low energy bulbs, with point clouds of 90 and 60 million points,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The construction industry is known for its fragmentation, poor
   performance and negative impacts on the environment. In recent years,
   Building Information Modelling (BIM), lean principles and sustainability
   concerns have emerged as trends in the industry, since they aim to
   improve how buildings are delivered throughout their entire lifecycle.
   Value aggregation and efficiency in operational and environmental terms
   are major concerns by stakeholders and wider society. Integrating these
   practices would yield better project outcomes. However, majority of
   studies are focused on these elements in isolation or in pairs and there
   are no comprehensive frameworks suggesting an integration. This study
   researched, analysed and articulated existing work on a possible
   integration framework of BIM, lean and sustainability principles (BLS)
   to promote performance improvements. Current proposals were analysed
   along with drivers, benefits, barriers and challenges for integration.
   Academics and industry practitioners will benefit from this framework as
   it looks into future requirements of the industry, which is aiming to
   achieve better efficiency and enhancement of sustainability outcomes.},

Abstract = {There are a great deal of complicated, various information in the

   the management level and management efficiency in a large extent by the

   the widespread phenomenon of the information island. The successful
   implementation of engineering construction depends largely on the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the information exchange among the
   participants. This paper firstly describes the basic concepts, technical
   characteristics and its application status of building information
   modeling (BIM). Then it analyses the existence of its many defects in
   the traditional project management information system, and points out
   that the traditional PMIS is increasingly unable to meet the needs of
   modern project management. So this paper proposes the framework of
   project management information system based on BIM, gives the system
   functions of the framework, points out the implementation ideas of these
   functions, and establishes a certain basis for the further
   implementation of system functions.},

Title = {BIM-FM and consequential loss: how consequential can design models be?},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {304-317},
Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modelling (BIM) offers a new direction of
   project implementation. It promotes integration of multiple lifecycle
   stages as well as multidisciplinary integration; whereas conventional
   approaches are primed on fragmentation. The purpose of this paper is to
   add to existing debates on the relationship between the rationality of
   the legal structures underlying fragmented project delivery and BIM's
   ability to successfully foster integration across different lifecycle
   stages. A step further from extant arguments on whether BIM could be
   sufficiently serviced by the same legal provisions that had serviced
   fragmented relationships, the study opens up some new fronts regarding
   the consequences of shared trusts and reciprocity in an integrated
   project platform.
   Design/methodology/approach - In addition to a deep analysis of
   traditional literature on BIM and project management, the study draws
   its strength from two recent court cases on the limitations of
   disclaimers against breaches. It also targets court decisions on
   consequential loss and the duty of care to explain project team's
   liabilities when BIM could not live to its theorized promises.
   Findings - The study shows that disclaimers are a weak protection
   against liabilities. As BIM offers a dynamic project environment, the
   study relies on decided cases to show that duty of care to a project
   (and its owners) is not entirely representable by prototype contract
   language. More importantly, the study concludes that the applications of
   BIM to facilities management are better supported on BIM's new dimension
   of multidisciplinary integration, rather than a mere coalescing of
   deliverables across different lifecycle fragments.
   Originality/value - This work presents a novel approach to the debate on
   the potentiality of BIM to drive project success. It adds to the growing
   discourse on the legal implications of BIM by considering the potential
   of digital models as a valid and admissible contract instrument.},

Abstract = {An active transition to a digital economy and the rapid development of
   information technologies makes it imperative for companies to search for
   new business management models. The formation and development of a
   Digital strategy integrated with business and HR strategies becomes a
   prerequisite for ensuring company's stable competitive position on the
   market due to its transformation into a technological one. At the
   junction of digitalization and personnel management, the new forms of
   management appear-digitalized personnel management. Digitalized
   personnel management makes a significant adjustment to the current
   management paradigm. The priorities in management, the principles of
   building organizational structures, the content of tasks and the life
   cycle of an enterprise change. At the same time, the list of
   requirements for candidates is undergoing significant changes and the
   rate of appearance of new professions is accelerating. The article
   discusses the basic theoretical provisions of digitalized personnel
   management, identifies its structure, components, impact on company's
   internal environment and the labor market in general. The transformation
   of personnel management processes is inevitable in view of the evolution
   of the organization management as it will result in an increase in the
   activity efficiency and in the shift of personnel employment in more
   creative professions requiring unique knowledge and skills. Undoubtedly,
   such qualitative transformations will affect not only the internal
   environment of the organization, but also the labor market as a whole,
   and in conjunction with it the education system. (c) 2019 Published by

Abstract = {Construction industry players are now realising the need to implement
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) at the preconstruction planning
   stage to allow spatial data of the site to be incorporated into BIM.
   Incorporating spatial data in BIM as early as possible in the building
   lifecycle poses a new challenge to industry players, particularly to the
   consultants who collect and provide these data. The aim of this study is
   to identify important factors through a consensus opinion of industry
   experts for incorporating spatial data into BIM at the preconstruction
   planning stage. Three rounds of the Delphi method were employed to
   obtain a consensus among twenty construction industry experts, selected
   through purposeful sampling. The findings revealed seven consolidated
   factors, with Technology, Client Demand, and Added Value as the top
   three, followed by Regulations, Skilled Staff, Management Commitment and
   Data Management. Experts were significantly in agreement with each
   other, as indicated by the Kendall's W Coefficient (= 0.6505)
   significant at < 0.005. The findings highlight the requirements for
   utilising spatial data in BIM at the preconstruction planning stage and
   help the respective professional bodies to identify the prerequisites
   for BIM application and subsequently, improve the existing training for
   the professional development of their members.},

Title = {EXPLORING THE ENTERPRISE BIM CONCEPT IN PRACTICE: THE CASE OF ASSET
   MANAGEMENT IN A NORWEGIAN HOSPITAL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Organizations face challenges in utilizing Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) for digital Asset Management (AM), as BIM from the design and
   construction phases often proves to be of limited use for AM. To address
   this, the concept of Enterprise BIM is introduced with the aim of
   organizing BIM activities throughout the lifecycle in line with the
   organization's operational and strategic needs. The article explores the
   current industry practices of implementing Enterprise BIM for effective
   AM support. It focuses on Vestfold Health Trust and its award-winning
   hospital project in Toensberg, Norway, which was notable for its use of
   Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and its attempts to adopt Enterprise
   BIM methodologies and solutions. Through literature studies and
   interviews with fifteen key personnel, the article provides
   recommendations for significant improvement within ontological
   adaptation, and associated IT solutions needs. The results highlight the
   limitations of using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and
   format for AM applications and suggest the development of flexible,
   searchable solutions based on ontologies and semantics to integrate
   sensor data into digital twins and asset information models. The study
   reveals a competency gap and deficiencies in information processes and
   IT solutions that organizations, along with the industry, must both
   address, emphasizing the use of international standards such as ISO
   19650 to improve the integration of value chain considerations. Overall,
   this article provides valuable recommendations and a roadmap for the
   more strategic, holistic, and sustainable management of building
   information that aims to take into account and satisfy the end-user's
   information needs.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Sustainability has been the subject of several scientific
   investigations. Many researchers in the construction industry have also
   examined a range of sustainability-related studies. However, few studies
   have thoroughly reviewed implementing sustainability concepts in
   high-rise residential buildings (HRRBs).
   Design/methodology/approach - By adopting scientometrics and systematic
   review (SR), this study seeks to map out recent sustainability trends
   and concepts in the design, development and operation of HRRBs worldwide
   and in Hong Kong. With a focus on bibliographic records from the Web of
   Science (WoS) database, 1,395 journal articles from 2013 to 2022 were
   analysed. Furthermore, thirteen studies were systematically reviewed.
   Findings - The SR indicated that sustainable practices in developing
   Hong Kong's HRRBs emphasised zero-carbon buildings, reduced energy usage
   and energy-efficient retrofitting. Likewise, terms such as BIM, urban
   density, life cycle assessment and system dynamics are strongly
   connected with clusters that include ``residential buildings{''},
   ``high-rise buildings{''} and ``high-rise residential buildings{''}. The
   study identified significant themes in establishing HRRBs by combining
   sustainable practices, emphasising urban governance and policy
   management, building performance and thermal comfort, energy and design
   optimisation, occupant behaviour and sensitivity analysis. Core
   sustainability ideas have improved resource management, air quality
   management and knowledge of user behaviour in HRRBs.
   Originality/value - The study allows researchers and practitioners to
   explore future research directions in the built environment per the
   application of sustainable concepts in the development of HRRBs from
   design, construction and post-construction phases.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is claimed to transform the
   Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, whereas
   current research has argued that diffusion of BIM use proceeds at a
   slower rate than the optimistic predictions. Despite that potential of
   BIM is higher in industrialized housebuilding, the trade express similar
   characteristics as traditional construction both in terms of BIM sue but
   also organization of assets. The aim of this paper is to present a
   conceptual framework for digital development in industrialized timber
   housing. Data were gathered from eight industrialized housebuilding
   companies in a mixed approach with interviews, focus groups and a
   survey. The analysis presents the current use of BIM and digital tools
   and prioritized development areas within this domain. By adding a
   theoretical overview of current research for industrialized
   housebuilding with focus on platform strategies and digital development
   a framework is drawn. Problems with transfer in the interfaces between
   software were emphasized. Current research on developing a system for
   Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in industrialized housebuilding
   indicate a path forward. A PLM system facilitates the development of
   digital developments such as digital twins and smart products, which
   possess the potentials to generate crucial feedback, which is crucial
   for the competitiveness and efficiency of industrialized housebuilding.
   Thus, for a trade with high levels of complexity, a move towards a fully
   functional PLM system might not only be desirable but decisive.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated digital
   transformation system framework (IDTSF) to help support business leaders
   and teams in making their products, services, and operations more

   to help organizations to avoid common failures when deploying digital
   transformation initiatives. The paper follows the design science
   research (DSR) and the information systems design science research
   (ISDSR) methodologies to develop the IDTSF model and a practical design
   artifact. The main problems were the initiation, execution, and
   governance challenges associated with digital transformation. After
   identifying the problems and the objectives, a relevant IDTSF model was
   synthesized and tested as a design artifact. The results of the test of
   the proposed artifact showed its effectiveness and efficiency in
   facilitating the components of the model in creating a cohesive

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {In order to enhance students' individual and team competency in building
   information modeling (BIM) project execution, this research adopts the
   team-based learning (TBL) pedagogy and aligns student learning outcomes
   in BIM with the hierarchy defined by Bloom's taxonomy of educational
   objectives into a Civil Engineering and Management (CEM) capstone
   project under the framework of the Accreditation Board for Engineering
   and Technology (ABET) standards. By designing a series of BIM learning
   modules in accordance with the different phases of a typical project
   lifecycle, including design, tendering and bidding, construction,
   closeout, and handover, this research investigates and evaluates how TBL
   may help students develop essential BIM knowledge, skills, and abilities
   (KSAs) and achieve a higher order of learning through role play in the
   contexts of a real BIM project. The four learning modules address both
   individual and team competency with core CEM program learning outcomes
   and are delivered through the TBL iterative process. The assessment of
   student learning and their achieved BIM competency through the capstone
   project are conducted with both direct and indirect measures using
   carefully designed grading rubrics and a student feedback survey. The
   research findings suggest that the combination of phased BIM learning
   modules and the TBL pedagogy may stimulate students' enthusiasm and
   foster individual and team performance at a higher level of competency
   in BIM project execution. The use of a real BIM project and the role
   play conducted by students in the TBL also enhance students' career
   preparedness by bridging the gap between BIM education in CEM programs
   and industry expectation on BIM competency of college graduates. This
   research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing empirical
   evidence on the efficacy of the TBL pedagogy in college BIM education
   and may become a valuable reference as more CEM programs seek to
   integrate collaborative interdisciplinary team experiences in BIM
   education to cultivate a more competent BIM workforce. (c) 2018 American

Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {This study explored which envelope solutions in retail buildings led to
   cost-optimal levels considering the Energy Performance of Building
   Directive and Portuguese regulation. For such, energy simulations were
   run in BIM software based on the analysis of a case study in Portugal.
   Typical alternative solutions were tested against the original case
   study, and solutions with considerably lower U-value considering the
   code for commercial buildings (0,7 W/m2 degrees K for walls and 0,5
   W/m2.degrees K for roofs). To assess the cost-effectiveness of
   alternative envelope solutions, the Payback Period, the Net Present
   Value and the Internal Rate of Return at 15 years and 50 years were
   assessed. Results indicate that solutions with lower U-values are
   related to 2-5\% savings in energy consumption and can be cost-effective
   at 15 and 50 years, namely vacuum insulation panels of 2.5 cm and
   sandwich panels of 8-12 cm. This leads to the conclusion that lowering
   present code U-values can be cost-effective, but it will result in
   additional initial costs.},

Abstract = {The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Plan of Work (PoW)
   together with Building Information Modelling (BIM) guidance documents,
   developed in the UK, are commonly used in Egypt and the Middle East.
   However, efforts from academics publishing articles about the
   experiences of the adoption of such BIM standards in Egypt have been
   very limited. This research investigates the use of a BIM-RIBA PoW in
   the construction industry in Egypt. The research aim was achieved
   through literature review and collecting qualitative data from industry
   practitioners. Focus group interviews was used to collect qualitative
   data, then analysed through consecutive stages of transcription, coding
   and structuring. The main finding of this study is that integrating the
   RIBA PoW in Egypt would be beneficial only if the established
   construction activities have been further detailed and linked to BIM
   concepts. A BIM-RIBA PoW has been developed through the identification
   of main BIM objectives and activities in each stage in the project
   lifecycle.},

Title = {ND BIM-integrated knowledge-based building management: Inspecting
   post-construction energy efficiency},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {13-28},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Inspection of sustainable performance during post-construction has
   become increasingly essential. However, conventional operation and
   maintenance processes are limited with a high probability of inaccurate
   manual building inspections and the lack of real-time input of dynamic
   factors. In this regard, engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based
   Building Management System using nD BIM applications (nD BIM-IKBMS) is
   anticipated to promote promising resolutions. The proposed system is
   expected to provide simulation-based supervisory control while
   automatically detecting and diagnosing operational faults. Following the
   literature-based conceptual model developed in our past research, this
   study aims to generate and verify the proposed framework theoretically,
   as the second step of nD BIM-IKBMS research and development series,
   concentrating on functional modeling. Notwithstanding which, it is
   difficult to describe a cross-disciplinary system following a single
   framework. As the technology evolves, the framework can not be
   generalized into new scenarios. Towards this end, the study is followed
   through the complexity theory lens. A highly flexible framework,
   considering that each part wherein has an opportunity to evolve, was
   developed. Following the principles of axiomatic design, the proposed
   framework was established. Ultimately, this research generates a range
   of detailed 3-hierarchical Icam DEFinitions for Function Modeling 0
   (IDEF0) diagrams outlining the proposed nD BIM-IKBMS structure. This
   study identifies the interoperability of the proposed framework by
   standardizing communication protocols, data formats, naming convention,
   evaluation systems, and modulization. While this research is limited to
   implementing our nD BIM-IKBMS framework, real-world projects will be
   utilized in our upcoming steps of R\&D series for validation purposes.},

Abstract = {Context. Development of safety assurance cases (SACs) is a trending need
   for certification of safety-critical systems in regulated domains. Their
   development encompasses collecting, linking, and structuring diverse
   project information, such as requirements, hazards, and components. A
   key building block of SACs is the explanation behind requirements and
   design decisions, the so-called assurance rationale, which provides
   compelling argumentation on the system suitability for use. Late
   development of SACs leads to late discovery of hazards, risks,
   requirement and design issues that affect the system safety. Question/
   problem. Current practice is to manage the assurance rationale in the
   SAC tools or artefacts, even though it is closely related to project and
   traceability information. This separation inhibits the shared
   understanding between safety and software professionals and may cause
   loss of rationale that results in a poor quality of certification
   documentation. It also hinders the automated SAC construction and
   assessment directly from project management tools. Principal
   ideas/results. This paper presents an approach to support the management
   of assurance rationale integrated with project information. Our approach
   defines an assurance rationale model that binds requirements, safety
   analysis information and assurance case elements. We show the use of the
   model applied to an issue tracking system. Contribution. We propose a
   new perspective on assurance cases management by bringing their building
   blocks into project management tools. Such integration could help bridge
   Safety and Software Engineering activities and avoid loss of rationale
   through the system life cycle. Also, it fosters the development of new
   approaches for SAC generation and assessment.},

Title = {Bidirectional interaction between BIM and construction processes using a
   multisource geospatial data enabled point cloud model},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has increasingly been adopted as an
   as-planned construction state to provide essential support for fine
   construction. However, some deviations are inevitably induced between
   the BIM model and actual construction states in practical construction
   processes, and these deviations obstruct the unidirectional interaction
   between the BIM model and actual construction states, thus seriously
   degrading the fine construction quality. This paper proposes a
   bidirectional interaction mechanism between BIM and construction
   processes using a multisource geospatial data enabled point cloud model.
   In the forward interaction, parametric BIM model are obtained to provide
   essential information for fine construction. Particularly, a multisource
   geospatial data enabled point cloud modeling strategy is the core of the
   proposed method, which overcomes complex buildings characterized by
   severe occlusions, specular surfaces and similar components to capture
   accurate and complete 3D point cloud model that reflects the actual
   construction state. In the backward interaction, the point cloud model
   provides feedback to adjust the BIM model for ensuring a fit between the
   BIM model and actual construction state. Moreover, the resulting
   up-to-date BIM model can further instruct the subsequent construction
   processes; thus, BIM and construction become a closed task-oriented
   loop. The proposed method was applied to the curtain wall construction
   of the main stadium for the Chengdu 2022 31st Summer World University
   Games and compared with four other state-of-the-art point cloud
   registration methods. The results demonstrated the superior accuracy of
   our method over other methods. The results also showed that the proposed
   method could effectively maintain the interaction between the BIM model
   and actual construction states throughout the construction lifecycle and
   ensure the quality of fine construction.},

Abstract = {The accident rate in the construction industry is the highest rate among
   all industries. In most cases, safety-planning is based on checklists
   and manual description which are not closely related to the actual and
   specific construction object. Safety planning in construction is a
   challenging task because of the large number of parties involved, the
   constantly changing conditions and the complexity of buildings. The
   objective evaluation of safety-planning methods regarding qualitative
   and quantitative factors could be considerably improved by applying
   innovative and integrated safety-planning tools. Modern technologies,
   such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), are offering an
   object-orientated planning approach towards the project's lifecycle.
   This paper solves this problem by applying an object-orientated and
   process-orientated job hazard analysis based on Building Information
   Models (BIM). The proposed rule-based system can detect a safety hazard
   early on in the design and planning process.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technologies for industrial plants,
   more and more tools for digital design, creation and operation of
   industrial facilities are emerged. In particular, significant success in
   development of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Digital Twin
   technologies (DT) should be noted, which act as tools for digital
   transformation and representation for construction and production
   technologies respectively. In this regard, in this article, the
   principles and methods of integrating BIM and DT technologies within the
   framework of the so-called ``Factories of the Future{''} (FoF) are
   formulated. Wherein the physical twin of FoF includes both production
   technologies and production infrastructure with buildings, structures
   and systems included in it, while particular attention is given to
   Operation and Maintenances (O\&M) stage of object lifecycle which is
   less developed in comparison with design and creation stages. In
   addition, this paper also considers the role of systems information
   modeling (SIM) in such objects. Moreover, the concept of ``digital
   asset{''}, closely related to the FoF, is examined and semantically
   analyzed, especially from information ownership point of view. The
   features of convergence of BIM and DT technologies are analyzed, and the
   levels of development of these technologies are compared. Finally, the
   directions of further research in this interdisciplinary branch of
   researches and development are formulated.},

Title = {Developing a methodological framework for consequential life cycle

Abstract = {Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) can play an important role in
   providing insights for decision-makers regarding potential
   market-mediated resource/environmental consequences stemming from
   changes in product systems. However, the consistent application of CLCA
   encounters challenges due to the absence of common guidelines. This
   systematic review studied different sets of literature to develop a
   methodological framework for CLCA of plant protein extraction through
   fractionation, using Canada as an example. Given that economic models
   are integral components of CLCA, this systematic review offers a
   comprehensive survey of the economic models employed in 18 CLCA studies,
   shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses. Notably,
   the study identifies the use of both Computable General Equilibrium and
   Partial Equilibrium models for enabling the analysis of large-scale and
   long-term changes. The estimation of land use changes (both direct and
   indirect) is an integral part and economic models are instrumental in
   quantifying indirect land use changes. For characterizing the common
   modelling practices in the agri-food sector, 33 CLCA studies were
   reviewed to extract information on the decision context, time horizon,
   identification of marginal/substitutable markets, uncertainty and
   sensitivity analyses, etc. `Increased supply' and `increased demand' are
   both found to be important decision contexts. It is a common practice to
   identify marginal markets based on assumptions, literature, and other
   sources along with employing economic models for some cases. However,
   economic models in the agri-food studies were used more often for
   estimating land use change impacts. To elaborate the case study of plant
   protein extraction (i.e., pea fractionation), some of the alternative
   uses of the co-products of pea fractionation processes as a basis for
   determining probable marginal markets were identified. Building upon
   these findings, the review culminates in the proposal of a detailed
   methodological framework for CLCA applied to pea fractionation,
   incorporating considerations of marginal markets that revolve around
   utilizing co-products like pea starch and pea fibre. Future research
   could focus on identifying marginal markets relevant to the Canadian
   landscape, thereby enhancing the applicability and relevance of CLCA
   within this region.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We present an algorithm for the reliability-based seismic design of
   structures incorporating approximate performance estimation methods and
   structural optimization. The proposed algorithm allows the automatic
   design of steel moment-resisting frames using reliability-based criteria
   and more specifically design criteria based on the mean annual frequency
   (MAF) that a limit-state is exceeded. Such criteria allow setting
   constraints with a clear engineering meaning and help to obtain building
   designs of improved performance and reduced cost. In this work, we
   propose a simplified approach that allows to quickly calculate the
   limit-state mean annual frequencies without significant loss of
   accuracy. More specifically, we use the
   static-pushover-to-incremental-dynamic-analysis (SPO2IDA) method, which
   in essence is a R-mu-T relationship with improved properties. SPO2IDA
   extracts information from the static pushover curve and produces
   estimates of the limit-state response statistics that are necessary to
   implement the reliability-based criteria on the limit-state MAF. The
   optimization problem at hand is solved with a specifically tailored
   genetic algorithm. A three and a nine-storey steel moment-resisting
   frame are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed procedure,
   leading to efficient building designs within reasonable computing time.

Title = {Development of a BIM-Enabled Automated Cost Segregation System},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The cost segregation study is a tax planning strategy employed to
   optimize cash flow by redefining real estate assets as personal property
   and land improvement, enabling accelerated tax depreciation. However,
   conventional cost segregation practices suffer from limitations, such as
   time-consuming procedures and high associated costs, which hinder their
   effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an
   innovative strategy that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   to develop an automated cost segregation system. The research aims to
   optimize the workflow by developing a BIM model and using 5D BIM to
   perform a cost segregation study by categorizing building elements under
   a Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). This workflow aims
   at minimizing the time and financial resources expended with traditional
   methodologies. The proposed workflow enables precise identification and
   separate depreciation of building components, resulting in significant
   tax deductions that would otherwise be unattainable. The results
   indicate that performing cost segregation with BIM leads to a
   significant increase in depreciation amounts, particularly during the
   initial six years, while also raising the net present value of
   depreciation by 45\%. The integration of BIM technology facilitates
   effective management and sharing of cost segregation data among
   stakeholders, enhancing collaboration and decision-making throughout the
   project lifecycle. Owners can optimize cost management and financial
   planning, identifying tax-saving opportunities and improving cash flow.
   General Contractors (GCs) can leverage the system during the bidding
   process, enhancing their competitiveness and project acquisition
   potential. Future research can explore the integration of cost
   segregation modules from BIM with asset management tools, enabling
   improved facility and fiscal management of building components. Such
   integration holds promise for enhancing the construction and real estate
   industry's overall efficiency and performance.},

Abstract = {Information exchange plays a crucial role in digital manufacturing.
   Newer paradigm such as Industry 4.0 utilizes data transfer through
   sophisticated technologies of sensors, internet, intelligent system, IoT
   and other related technologies across enterprise. Above concepts tends
   to create manufacturing sector into ``Smart Industries{''}. Exchange of
   product model information without human intervention helps in automation
   and integration of different sections of the manufacturing organization.
   STEP (STandard for Exchange of Product model data) used EXPRESS
   language, represents information of product model data in object
   oriented structure. STEP contains different Application Protocols (APs),
   which are suitable for different domains of product life cycle. AP203
   represents geometrical and topological information of product. AP224
   represents feature information of product in a well-defined structure.
   STEP-NC codes have data of manufacturing features as well as
   manufacturing process; it evolved as a superior format for computer
   control of machine tools as compared to G-M codes. STEP-NC was
   standardised in two forms, namely, ISO 14,649 and ISO 10303-238 (AP238).
   AP238 has rich set of information, which can be used across product
   lifecycle, as it uses STEP generic resources for building a particular
   model. STEP based methods and their application areas, seem to be an
   excellent conveyor of smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0, which would
   help in complete integration of CAD/CAPP/CAM. In this article, a
   detailed review of works related different STEP methods are presented
   along with detailed study of past research using different STEP formats.
   From this review study, it can be concluded that STEP AP238 provides an
   effective, efficient and sustainable format for seamless integration of
   various activities related to design and manufacturing processes
   involved in scenario of Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of a
   collaborative Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) of a
   19th-century multi-building industrial site in the UK. The buildings
   were Grade II listed by Historic England for architectural and
   structural features. The buildings were also a key element of the
   industrial heritage and folklore of the surrounding area. As the site
   was due to undergo major renovation work, this project was initiated to
   develop a HBIM of the site that encapsulated both tangible and
   intangible heritage data. Design/methodology/approach The design of the
   research in this study combined multiple research methods. Building on
   an analysis of secondary data surrounding HBIM, a community of practice
   was established to shape the development of an HBIM execution plan
   (HBEP) and underpin the collaborative BIM development. The tangible HBIM
   geometry was predominantly developed using a scan to BIM methodology,
   whereas intangible heritage data were undertaken using unstructured
   interviews and a focus group used to inform the presentation approach of
   the HBIM data. Findings The project produced a collaboratively generated
   multi-building HBIM. The study identified the need for a dedicated HBEP
   that varies from prevailing BIM execution plans on construction
   projects. Tangible geometry of the buildings was modelled to LOD3 of the
   Historic England guidelines. Notably, the work identified the fluid
   nature of intangible data and the need to include this in an HBIM to
   fully support design, construction and operation of the building after
   renovation. A methodology was implemented to categorise intangible
   heritage data within a BIM context and an approach to interrogate these
   data from within existing BIM software tools. Originality/Value The
   paper has presented an approach to the development of HBIM for large
   sites containing multiple buildings/assets. The framework implemented
   for an HBEP can be reproduced by future researchers and practitioners
   wishing to undertake similar projects. The method for identifying and
   categorising intangible heritage information through the developed level
   of intangible cultural heritage was presented as new knowledge. The
   development of HBIM to bring together tangible and intangible data has
   the potential to provide a model for future work in the field and
   augment existing BIM data sets used during the asset lifecycle.},

   approach to achieve circular economy: A pattern-matching method},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The current linear system of using natural resources for the
   construction industry, including extraction, consumption and disposal
   does not address the need to reduce the impact on environment and is
   long overdue. That is why various countries have set up plans to move
   towards the Circular Economy (CE) leading the construction sector to
   adopt new approaches for ensuring to close the loop of building
   materials. This paper explores the socioeconomic and environmental
   barriers for the implementation of the CE, in a BIM environment. Twenty
   semistructured interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders
   involved in the asset lifecycle, experts in BIM or in sustainable
   approaches, to understand the obstacles to the holistic consideration of
   the asset lifecycle in the CE context. A descriptive interpretative
   analysis was used for the interviews' transcripts to identify common
   themes and sub-themes. A pattern-matching method was used for seeking
   the similarities and differences between the twenty stakeholders' views
   and the literature. The study shows thirty-four new barriers identified
   by the interviewees and not found in the literature. Recommendations are
   given for accelerating the asset lifecycle reconsideration and the CE
   embracement.},

Journal = {PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {In this study, the economic feasibility of strengthening several types
   of low-code RC structures in Bucharest is analyzed. Using recently
   compiled information regarding the characteristics of the residential
   building stock of Bucharest built in the period 1963-1977, an updated
   seismic risk assessment is performed. Moreover, analytical fragility
   functions are obtained for each structural system by employing the same
   approach that relies on the pushover curve. Subsequently, a logic-tree
   approach involving previously derived fragility functions is employed
   for seismic risk computations. Three economic loss models and two
   casualty loss models were implemented in the risk assessment procedure.
   The smallest mean annual loss is obtained for the medium-rise large
   panels structures that had very good behavior during the Vrancea 1977
   earthquake. The analysis of the economic feasibility of strengthening
   shows that the RC soft-story structures appear as the most feasible to
   be strengthened because the range of costs of the strengthening works is
   the largest in this case. Correspondingly, the RC dual structures appear
   as the least feasible for strengthening works among the considered
   structural systems. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated
   the cost of inadequate interoperability within Property, Construction
   and Facility Management Industry at \$15.8 billion per year. These costs
   were incurred by the capital facilities industry and represented between
   1-2\% of its cross-market revenue. Based on project lifecycle phases,
   the breakdown of these numbers revealed that the highest costs were
   incurred at the operations and maintenance phase directly followed by
   construction (NIST, 2004). According to the Institute, interoperability
   is ``the ability to manage and communicate electronic product and
   project data between collaborating firms' and within individual
   companies' design, construction, maintenance, and business process
   systems.{''} Interoperability and Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   are intrinsically linked. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a
   model-centric management system that ``can capture, manage and present
   data in ways that are appropriate and customary for a particular
   designer, contractor, vendor or client{''} (Ibrahim et al., 2003). BIM
   is steadily gaining industrial acceptance as a replacement of
   documentation-centric Computer Aided Design (CAD). BIM has multiple
   representation protocols that are all facing similar barriers to
   adoption including: commercial, organisational and regulatory barriers
   (Drogemuller and Hampson, 2004). With the advent of the semantic web
   this paper questions the future and current shortcomings for Industry
   Foundation Classes. It also identifies (1) the value of interoperability
   to the industry and, (2) the key economic incentives for the adoption of
   Building information modeling. The model is then discussed with industry
   and business experts. Identification of relevant drivers and barriers
   for BIM adoption are discussed in relation with (Roger's 1995) Diffusion
   Model. Results are expected to assist the effective uptake of BIM.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) provides a novel way of information
   management for all lifecycle phases of a building project. It is
   facilitating the processes of a construction project, such as
   architectural design, structural analysis, and construction management.
   Industry foundation classes (IFC) is an open standard for information
   exchange between different BIM applications in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) domain. It represents project
   information in an interoperable way that contains geometric information,
   material information, and other physical and functional information
   needed of analyzing and managing a project. Structural analysis aims to
   simulate the structural performance of a building under different types
   of loads to make sure the structure is safe. The needed information for
   structural analysis mainly include geometric, material, and load
   information. These information come from architectural design and
   selected analysis scenarios. The information should be represented in an
   interoperable way to allow information transfer between different phases
   and different stakeholders. Information missing is a crucial problem
   during the interoperable use of BIM, which may cause misunderstandings
   between different stakeholders and therefore erroneous structural
   analysis result and misleading information to feed construction process
   later on. In this paper, the authors focus on analyzing the use of IFC
   at three stages in structural analysis, namely, intrinsic modeling
   stage, extrinsic modeling stage, and the analysis stage. The authors
   compared IFC files at these three stages with original BIM software text
   files in terms of information coverage, and identified information
   missing cases. This is the first systematic investigation of BIM
   interoperability at detailed work stages of structural analysis and
   provides insights in how BIM usage should be improved in this domain.},

Title = {Facilitating compliance with BIM ISO 19650 naming convention through

Abstract = {Purpose To foster effective implementation of building information
   modelling (BIM), it is guided by standards and protocols that require
   files naming in a format, containing a string of letters and digits in a
   tightly defined manner, which is perceived to be time-consuming,
   error-prone and serves as a barrier to BIM adoption. This paper aims to
   present a BIM-based plug-in solution (Auto-BIMName) that facilitates
   automated naming in compliance with BIM standards.
   Design/methodology/approach The Auto-BIMName portal has an information
   management system (IMS) for generating a master information delivery
   plan (MIDP), which serves as pre-requisites to effective file naming.
   Once the naming schema is implemented through text input controls for a
   project name, volume, level and number, the Revit plugin communicates
   with its IMS to fetch the name string or concatenate the string in line
   with the ISO 19650 convention, where the IMS is unused. The system was
   validated through a simulated collaborative project. Findings System
   testing and evaluation confirmed that the Auto-BIMName will ease the
   process of file naming, thereby facilitating collaboration efficiency,
   naming consistency across project teams and lifecycle stages, ease of
   file naming, time-saving and inducement for BIM implementation, etc. By
   linking information from MIDP in the BIM execution plan, the platform
   enhanced information management processes and improved coordination
   across project teams and lifecycle stages. Originality/value Apart from
   demonstrating how the automated naming platform enhances project
   performance, information management and coordination, the paper provides
   a practical demonstration of how the construction industry will benefit
   from enhanced digitalisation and process automation.},

Title = {Global construction materials database and stock analysis of residential
   buildings between 1970-2050},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Huge material stocks are embedded in the residential built environment.
   These materials have the potential to be a source of secondary
   materials, an important consideration for the transition towards a
   circular economy. Consistent information about such stocks, especially
   at the global level, is missing. This article attempts to fill part of
   that gap by compiling a material intensities database for different
   types of buildings and applying that data in the context of a scenario
   analysis, linked to the SSP scenarios as implemented in the global
   climate model IMAGE. The database is created on a global scale, dividing
   the world into 26 regions in compliance with IMAGE. The potential use of
   the database was tested and served as input for modelling the housing
   and material stock of residential buildings for the period 1970-2050,
   according to specifications made for the SSP2 scenario. Six construction
   materials in four different dwelling types in urban and rural areas are
   included. The material flows related to those stocks are estimated and
   analysed in a companion paper (also exploring commercial buildings) by
   Deetman et al. (2019). The results suggest a significant increase in the
   material stock in housing towards 2050, particularly in urban areas. The
   results reflect specific patterns in the material contents across the
   different building types. China presently dominates developments in the
   global level building stock. The SSP2 projections show a stock
   saturation towards 2050 for China. In other regions, such as India and
   South East Asia, stock growth is presently just taking off and can be
   expected to become dominant for global developments after 2050. The
   database is created to be used as input for resource and climate
   policymaking as well as assessment of environmental impact related to
   residential buildings and assessment of possibilities for urban mining.
   In the future, we hope to extend it as new data on materials in the
   built environment become available. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Most existing life-cycle release models for engineered nanomaterials
   (ENM) are static, ignoring the dynamics of stock and flows of ENMs. Our
   model, nanoRelease, estimates the annual releases of ENMs from
   manufacturing, use, and disposal of a product explicitly taking stock
   and flow dynamics into account. Given the variabilities in key
   parameters (e.g., service life of products and annual release rate
   during use) nanoRelease is designed as a stochastic model. We apply
   nanoRelease to three ENMs (TiO2, SiO2 and FeOx) used in paints and
   coatings through seven product applications, including construction and
   building, household and furniture, and automotive for the period from
   2000 to 2020 using production volume and market projection information.
   We also consider model uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulation.
   Compared with 2016, the total annual releases of ENMs in 2020 will
   increase by 34-40\%, and the stock will increase by 28-34\%. The
   fraction of the end-of-life release among total release flows will
   increase from 11\% in 2002 to 43\% in 2020. As compared to static
   models, our dynamic model predicts about an order of magnitude lower
   values for the amount of ENM released from this sector in the near-term
   while stock continues to build up in the system.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of smart hydropower, the application of
   visualization integration technology based on BIM and WebGIS in the
   entire lifecycle of engineering is increasing year by year. The
   traditional static information based management model can no longer meet
   the growing management needs of engineering. Therefore, this study first
   focuses on building a refined BIM 3D model using BIM technology, and
   implements the extension and integration of missing dynamic monitoring
   information in the original BIM based on the universal IFC format. Then,
   based on the WebGL open-source framework for 3D GIS, Cesium serves as
   the basic platform for WebGIS, expanding the depth of BIM related data

Abstract = {During the service of civil engineering structures such as large-scale
   frames, long-span bridges and high-rise buildings, local damage of their
   key positions may continually accumulate, and finally results in sudden
   failure of structures. In recent years, long-term health monitoring and
   condition assessment for long-span bridges have emerged as a viable
   alternative to the traditional methods of visual inspection and
   nondestructive instrumental evaluation. Developing a long-term
   monitoring system for a long-span bridge-one that is really able to
   provide information for evaluating structural integrity, durability and
   reliability throughout the bridge life cycle and ensuring optimal
   maintenance planning and safe bridge operation-poses technological
   challenges at different levels. This paper explores recent technology
   advances in the field of structural health monitoring and condition
   assessment for the Runyang Yangtse River Bridge. Some key issues
   including the baseline finite element modeling, structural damage
   alarming, structural damage location identification and serviceability
   reliability assessment are discussed in detail with regard to the
   realization strategies and methods together with the typical analysis
   results.},

Abstract = {Software reliability assessment models in use today treat software as a
   monolithic block. An aversion towards `'atomic'' models seems to exist.
   These models appear to add complexity to the modeling, to the data
   collection and seem intrinsically difficult to generalize. This paper
   presents an architecturally based software reliability model and
   underlines its benefits. The model is based on an architecture derived
   from the requirements which captures both functional and non-functional
   requirements and on a generic classification of functions, attributes
   and failure modes. The model focuses on evaluation of failure mode
   probabilities and uses a Bayesian quantification framework Failure mode
   probabilities of functions and attributes are propagated to the system
   level using fault trees. The model accounts explicitly for the type of
   software development life cycle. It can incorporate any type of prior
   information such as results of developers' testing, historical
   information on a specific functionality and its attributes, and, is
   ideally suited for reusable software. By building an architecture and
   deriving its potential failure modes, the model forces early appraisal
   and understanding of the weaknesses of the software, allows reliability
   analysis of the structure of the system, provides assessments at a
   functional level as well as at a systems' level The model is applied to
   a simple example. The model's assessment of reliability tends to be
   conservative and the model appears to de scalable to larger, more
   complex problems.},

Abstract = {To optimize energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and
   prolong life cycle of networks, aiming at the problems in LEACH
   algorithm, such as random selection of cluster-heads, indeterminate
   cluster-heads number, accelerated death of cluster-head nodes and so on,
   an efficient clustering routing algorithm for WSNs (EECR) was proposed.
   This algorithm is based on LEACH algorithm. In the cluster building
   stage, four sub-thresholds were designed, i.e. residual energy of node,
   based on base-station distance, number of cluster-head in networks and
   round number that nodes are selected as cluster-heads. In stable data
   transmission stage, the effective path of node was utilized and free
   spatial model and multi-path attenuation model were integrated to
   realize effective data transmission. In simulation experiment, the
   network life, residual energy and information amount received by base
   station were compared. The results indicate that, compared to LEACH,
   LEACH-C, HEED and EEUC, the EECR algorithm can effectively reduce energy
   consumption and prolong network lifetime, and its overall performance is
   superior to LEACH, LEACH-C, HEED and EEUC algorithms.},

Abstract = {Purpose Integrated project delivery (IPD) and building information
   modeling (BIM) has begun to be used in real estate development projects
   over the past decade to improve collaboration, communication and
   efficiency. However, the use of BIM and IPD in projects does not always
   imply that the information is well used and managed. This study aims to
   explain how information management should be carried out in BIM and IPD
   projects, what activities should be managed by the information manager
   and which stakeholder should play this role and why?
   Design/methodology/approach This study provides a framework on the
   subject by conducting a comprehensive systematic review in the field of
   real estate development, BIM, IPD and information management. In this
   context, the Web of Science and Scopus databases have been
   systematically reviewed, n = 45 out of a total of n = 1,356 articles and
   additionally, the BIM documents and standards prepared by public
   institutions and organizations and industry reports have been examined
   in detail.
   Findings The framework for information management roles was established
   by reviewing the literature. According to this framework, information
   management activities of information managers are listed in the table
   that covers all phases of real estate development. The owner should
   undertake this role as it is the entity that oversees the built asset
   from planning to the management of that facility.
   Originality/value In terms of acquiring information management roles,
   there is no research on BIM and IPD projects and who will take over this
   role. This study desired to close this gap in the literature.},

Title = {Synchronizing BIM cost models and bills of quantities for lifecycle
   audit trail cost management},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 9},
Abstract = {PurposeAudit trail cost management is crucial for ensuring
   accountability and enhancing quality assurance in construction
   management. Despite limited practical studies on audit trail management
   from a cost perspective; this study developed a lifecycle-based audit
   trail cost management framework. It used synchronized Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) cost models and Bills of Quantities (BoQs) to
   address the existing gap.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed
   a descriptive case study approach of a real-life hospital project in
   China. Data triangulation was achieved through interviews, observations,
   documents, and relevant artifacts.FindingsThe study identified three key
   factors contributing to cost variances between BIM cost models and BoQs:
   differences in measurement rules, model precision, and professional
   errors, particularly evident during the preliminary estimate stage.
   Notably, significant cost savings of approximately RMB 5.811 million
   were achieved during the detailed estimate stage. During the
   construction phase, a synchronized approach was deployed to improve
   precise payment verification and modifications to the BIM model. In the
   post-construction phase, the synchronized as-built BIM models and BoQs
   served as primary references to facilitate the resolution of operational
   discrepancies.Practical implicationsThe research contributes to the
   literature by proposing a synchronized approach of BIM cost models and
   BoQs. This approach enhances traceability and accountability of project
   information, catering to the digitalization needs of the construction
   industry.Originality/valueThis study unveils a pragmatic approach to
   enhancing transparency and accountability in audit-trail cost management
   by synchronizing BIM cost models and BoQs at various project stages. The
   synchronized approach offers a promising direction for future research
   and implementation of audit trail frameworks to enhance cost management
   in construction.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an informatics framework to apply feature-based
   engineering concept for cost estimation supported with data mining
   algorithms. The purpose of this research work is to provide a practical
   procedure for more accurate cost estimation by using the commonly
   available manufacturing process data associated with ERP systems. The
   proposed method combines linear regression and data-mining techniques,
   leverages the unique strengths of the both, and creates a mechanism to
   discover cost features. The final estimation function takes the user's
   confidence level over each member technique into consideration such that
   the application of the method can phase in gradually in reality by
   building up the data mining capability. A case study demonstrates the
   proposed framework and compares the results from empirical cost
   prediction and data mining. The case study results indicate that the
   combined method is flexible and promising for determining the costs of
   the example welding features. With the result comparison between the
   empirical prediction and five different data mining algorithms, the ANN
   algorithm shows to be the most accurate for welding operations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is defined as the process of
   creation and management of digital replica for building products in a
   collaborative design set-up. On this basis, BIM as a digital
   collaboration platform in AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction,
   and Operation) industry, can be upgraded to assist monitoring, control
   and improvement of the business processes related to planning, design,
   construction and operation of building facilities. The main problem in
   this regard, is the wastage of data related to activities completed by
   different actors during the project; and subsequently, the lack of
   analytics to discover latent patterns in collaboration and execution of
   such processes. The present study aims to enable BIM to capture digital
   footprints of project actors and create event logs for design authoring
   phase of building projects. This is done using files in IFC (Industry
   Foundation Classes) format, archived during the design process. We have
   developed algorithms to create event logs from such archives, and
   analyzed the event logs using process mining (i.e. process discovery,
   conformance checking and bottleneck analysis), to identify measures
   derived from as-happened processes. BIM managers can implement such
   measures in monitoring, controlling and re-engineering work processes
   related to design authoring. Two case studies were completed to validate
   and verify the products and findings of the research. Our results show
   that process models discovered/fine-tuned at various resolutions and
   from different perspectives (including `actor-centric' and
   `phase-centric' views) can provide a realistic view of the BIM project
   execution. This includes understanding the structure of collaboration
   and hand-over of work; evaluation of compliance with the BIM execution
   plan; and detection of bottlenecks and re-works. While the scope of the
   study has been limited to design authoring processes, this mindset can
   be extended to other BIM uses, and other phases (such as construction
   and operation) of building projects. Given the growing efforts on
   upgrading BIM to capture and formalize the lifecycle data on the
   products, processes and actors, this study can strongly support BIM
   managers with documentation and evaluation of the business processes and
   workflows in their project teams.},

Journal = {DISEGNARECON},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In recent years, various advancements have been made in the
   implementation of digital model into HBIM as a valid option for managing
   and visualizing the information generated in the documentation of
   heritage architecture and preventive conservation actions. However,
   there is a set of analyses often ignored due to a lack of knowledge
   about the documentary value they can provide. These encompass geometric,
   compositional, and metrological analyses in preliminary studies of
   heritage architecture. This contribution presents a protocol for
   conducting geometric, compositional, and metrological analyses within
   the context of heritage buildings using an HBIM framework. It
   incorporates a comparative study between theoretical models and the
   actual state extracted from point clouds generated by 3D laser scanning.
   All of this is aimed at deriving insights into the immediate
   visualization of the design process carried out by the master builder,
   as well as the variations experienced by the analyzed elements, both
   during the construction process and over their life cycle. For this
   purpose, the vaulted spaces of the bell tower at Valencia Cathedral
   serve as a test laboratory.},

Title = {Supporting the selection of a variant of the adaptation of a historical
   building with the use of fuzzy modelling and structural analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Changing the function of a historical building through adapting it to
   new use is one of the more effective ways of extending the life-cycle of
   degraded historical structures. The process of selecting a new method of
   use of a historical building requires the involvement of conscious
   decision-makers, whose view of the benefits associated with the
   adaptation reaches beyond economic gain, but also includes the
   importance of the protection of cultural heritage, as well as other
   benefits associated with the concept of sustainable development. The
   will to include interdisciplinary benefits, as well as the distinct
   nature of the decision making problem that is the imprecise nature of
   information and the conflicts between the parties invested in the
   decision-making process adds to the complexity of the problem. The
   proper approach to these kinds of decision-making problems is making an
   attempt at deconstructing the problem and expressing it in a synthetic
   manner in the form of a model, followed by performing its analysis. The
   literature on the subjects provides a number of multi-criteria methods
   that can be used to support making decisions of this type. However, most
   of these methods do not take into account the relationships between the
   selection criteria, while none of them is suited to processing the
   imprecise and uncertain character of the initial data, which is a
   typical feature of decision-making problem at hand. Wishing to address
   these issues, the authors of this article propose a complex,
   multi-criteria approach that incorporates the above elements. Finally,
   the authors provide a practical example of the practical implementation
   of the aforementioned approach as a tool supporting the selection of a
   new form of use for the Great Armoury historical building, located in
   Gdansk, Poland. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Synthesis of Trigeneration Systems: Sensitivity Analyses and Resilience},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {This paper presents sensitivity and resilience analyses for a
   trigeneration system designed for a hospital. The following information
   is utilized to formulate an integer linear programming model: (1) energy
   service demands of the hospital, (2) technical and economical
   characteristics of the potential technologies for installation, (3)
   prices of the available utilities interchanged, and (4) financial
   parameters of the project. The solution of the model, minimizing the
   annual total cost, provides the optimal configuration of the system
   (technologies installed and number of pieces of equipment) and the
   optimal operation mode (operational load of equipment, interchange of
   utilities with the environment, convenience of wasting cogenerated heat,
   etc.) at each temporal interval defining the demand. The broad range of
   technical, economic, and institutional uncertainties throughout the life
   cycle of energy supply systems for buildings makes it necessary to delve
   more deeply into the fundamental properties of resilient systems:
   feasibility, flexibility and robustness. The resilience of the obtained
   solution is tested by varying, within reasonable limits, selected
   parameters: energy demand, amortization and maintenance factor, natural
   gas price, self-consumption of electricity, and time-of-delivery feed-in
   tariffs.},

Title = {Thermal Energy Performance Simulation of a Residential Building
   Retrofitted with Passive Design Strategies: A Case Study in Mexico},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {High energy consumption as a result of an inefficient design has both
   economic and environmental repercussions throughout the life cycle of a
   building. In Mexico, the residential sector is the third-largest final
   energy consumer, therefore improving the performance of existing
   buildings is considered an effective method in achieving energy savings.
   Moreover, in Mexico warm climate regions predominate, which impacts
   energy consumption. This article examines a linked, single-family house
   located in the hot-humid climate city of Villahermosa, Tabasco (Mexico).
   DesignBuilder software was used to conduct the thermal energy
   performance simulation of the existing building (base case) and to
   evaluate the energy-saving potentials by implementing different passive
   design strategies. As a result, the annual electricity consumption of
   the base case decreased a maximum of 2.0\% with the passive design
   strategy in exterior windows, 4.9\% in walls and, 13.7\% reduction in
   roofs, the latter being the enclosure with the greatest reduction
   achieved. Nevertheless, a final adaptation proposal with the passive
   design strategies, whose results represented the highest energy savings,
   accomplished a total reduction of 23.5\% with a payback period of 5.8
   years.},

Abstract = {With the application and development of high-throughput sequencing
   technology in life and health sciences, massive multi-omics data brings
   the problem of efficient management and utilization. Database
   development and biocuration are the prerequisites for the reuse of these

   CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) for archiving omics data, including raw
   sequencing data and its further analyzed results which are organized
   into six objects, namely Project, Sample, Experiment, Run, Assembly and
   Variation at present. Moreover, CNSA has created a correlation model of
   living samples, sample information and analytical data on some projects.
   Both living samples and analytical data are directly correlated with the
   sample information. From either one, information or data of the other
   two can be obtained, so that all data can be traced throughout the life
   cycle from the living sample to the sample information to the analytical
   data. Complying with the data standards commonly used in the life
   sciences, CNSA is committed to building a comprehensive and curated data
   repository for storing, managing and sharing of omics data. We will
   continue to improve the data standards and provide free access to

Title = {Artificial intelligence exploitation in facility management using deep
   learning},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {609-624},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to apply a methodology that is capable to classify and
   localize mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) elements to assist
   facility managers. Furthermore, it assists in decreasing the technical
   complexity and sophistication of different systems to the facility
   management (FM) team.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research exploits artificial intelligence (AI) in FM operations
   through proposing a new system that uses a deep learning pre-trained
   model for transfer learning. The model can identify new MEP elements
   through image classification with a deep convolutional neural network
   using a support vector machine (SVM) technique under supervised
   learning. Also, an expert system is developed and integrated with an
   Android application to the proposed system to identify the required
   maintenance for the identified elements. FM team can reach the
   identified assets with bluetooth tracker devices to perform the required
   maintenance.
   Findings
   The proposed system aids facility managers in their tasks and decreases
   the maintenance costs of facilities by maintaining, upgrading, operating
   assets cost-effectively using the proposed system.
   Research limitations/implications
   The paper considers three fire protection systems for proactive
   maintenance, where other structural or architectural systems can also
   significantly affect the level of service and cost expensive repairs and
   maintenance. Also, the proposed system relies on different platforms
   that required to be consolidated for facility technicians and managers
   end-users. Therefore, the authors will consider these limitations and
   expand the study as a case study in future work.
   Originality/value
   This paper assists in a proactive manner to decrease the lack of

Abstract = {The digital transformation of operation and maintenance (O\&M)
   activities has been guiding the facilities management sector towards a
   strategic role focused on the performance of businesses and sustainable
   use of natural resources over assets' lifecycles. Despite the
   application of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such
   as building information modelling (BIM) and the Internet of Things
   (IoT), demonstrating potential for improving such practices, evidence
   related to its implementation process from an FM professional's
   perspective is still much needed to unlock billions of USD trapped in
   inefficient and fragmented processes. This research seeks such evidence
   by characterising current and potential applications of BIM and
   IoT-based solutions for FM, specifically on maintenance services. This
   exploratory research is based on a multiple case study where three
   universities' FM sectors were investigated. Data collection and analysis
   included semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and inductive content
   analysis. By considering technology as a scaffold to enhance human
   activities, the investigation provided a deep understanding of
   technological, procedural, and policy issues in implementing BIM and
   IoT-based solutions in FM activities and their related benefits and
   limitations. Clarifying the necessary resources for such implementation
   could support FM sectors and organizations in justifying human and
   financial investments and planning the gradual digital transformation of
   services.},

Title = {Development of a BIM and IoT-Based Smart Lighting Maintenance System
   Prototype for Universities' FM Sector},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Reactive maintenance (RM) is a core service of the operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) phase, the most prolonged and costly within the
   building lifecycle. RM is characterised by inefficient asset information
   and communication management, impacting critical FM problems and users'
   experience. Building information modelling (BIM) and Internet of things
   (IoT) has enabled the development of digital twins, moving facilities
   management (FM) from a reactive approach towards a predictive one.
   Although previous studies have investigated the application of such
   technologies to FM, there is a lack of understanding on procedural
   issues related to its implementation in FM and RM. This research aimed
   to characterise strategies and decisions involved in prototyping a BIM
   and IoT-based smart-lighting maintenance system and identify its
   potential impacts on universities' maintenance processes. The adopted
   research strategy and data collection methods involved prototyping,
   questionnaires, and interviews. The results show a high level of
   complexity in converging maintenance needs and technological abilities
   for FM and the importance of procedures and standards at organisational
   and industry levels. Moreover, it evidenced that the automation of
   functions and the centralisation of information enabled by BIM and IoT
   can optimise service provision, generate environmental and efficiency
   gains, and improve users' safety and satisfaction.},

Title = {Management of Project Properties in ``Virtual Archive{''} for Building
   Design Industry},
Journal = {INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS},
Year = {2009},
Number = {4},
Pages = {15-23},
Abstract = {The aim of this research is to reduce a project development time and
   costs in building design and construction industry. It is performed by
   managing project technical documentation and digital data, which
   involves the complete life cycle of design documentation and
   design-related data inside CAD applications. Life cycle of design
   documentation and design-related data is achieved through the
   engineering document management system (EDM). EDM system founded on
   electronic archive system, which stores and distributes all technical
   information. The electronic archive is based on reference model for an
   Open Archival Information System (OAIS). As OAIS is a universal and
   uniform system, a technological development is required for customizing
   it to a specific industry (such as, building design and construction
   industry). Such development is presented in this work with an emphasis
   on management of projects document properties and their inheritance. The
   document properties play an important role in an archive, as they
   represent an instrument for performing any manipulations with a document
   (such as submission, distribution, search, modification and so on).
   Thus, any document placed in an archive has to be accompanied by
   document properties. This issue is addressed because the straightforward
   attachment of properties directly to a document introduces a lot of
   mistakes. This may lead to misplacement of document in archive system.
   Instead of this, in a proposed approach the properties were attached to
   the project structure (also called hierarchal tree).
   The previous developments in management Of electronic archive were
   focused on the automatization of data gathering, processing and
   submitting. It allows storing the technical documentation according to
   the rules, which were based on the flow of documentation in a building
   design company. It was insured by additional models enclosed into the
   system - now called the, `monolithic archive{''}. However, the growing
   requirements of engineers, and internal collaboration required across
   engineering departments, lead to the constant modification of
   ``monolithic archive{''} and the basis of OAIS model. This introduces
   delays in engineering product design processes and requires an
   implementation of trainings and instructions. Therefore, the
   ``monolithic{''} archive was fundamentally restructured rejecting all
   intermediate OAIS models. It was named as a ``virtual{''} archive, since
   it operates from a ``virtual{''} vault rather than a centralized vault.
   The objective of this work is to propose and implement a new development
   of an electronic archive system (named ``virtual{''} archive) that
   offers a management of project document properties and inheritance in a
   structural way. A ``virtual archive{''} was built for storing files that
   do not lock engineering documents into proprietary data vault. This open
   architecture prepares engineering to merge into a corporate environment
   without changing usually work routines. The document management and
   search in a distributed network can be performed by using Window File
   explore, Word, Excel, or CAD applications, thus avoiding any
   intermediate links. It provides all essential document management
   capabilities, property management, version control, advanced searching,
   user and work group management. A ``virtual archive{''} maintains
   project properties, metadata and related files so that it enables
   properties inheritance and management of document properties. Property
   inheritance is established according to the project structure and
   components. It takes a form of hierarchical tree, which reflects the
   main phases of the construction process.},

   Design/methodology/approach The research design employs a participatory
   action research (PAR) approach. The PAR approach utilized two
   qualitative data collection methods, namely; focus group and interviews
   to identify and evaluate the required standards for the mapping of
   different domains. Also prototyping which is an approach of Software
   Development Methodology is utilized to develop the ontologies and Linked
   Data. Findings The proposed process offers a comprehensive description
   of the required standards and classifications in construction domain,
   related vocabularies and object-oriented links to ensure the effective
   data integration between different domains. Also the proposed process
   demonstrates the different stages, tools, best practices and guidelines
   to develop Linked Data, armed with a comprehensive use case Linked Data

Journal = {BAUTECHNIK},

Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {338-347},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The handling of all processes in the life cycle of structures with the
   aid of a digital building model is inseparably linked with the term Open
   BIM, especially in Europe. For this reason, the heterogeneous software
   landscape existing in Central Europe creates problems in data exchange,
   for which there are basically two approaches for a solution available.
   On the one hand this is the handling of projects in a closed-BIM
   approach and on the other hand the use of Open BIM, for which
   manufacturer-neutral file formats and data structures are required.
   The IFC format is the state of the art. However, not all so-called
   characteristics of components, which mainly define their qualities, are
   mapped there correctly. The essential point in data exchange is the
   standardization of these features - to speak ``a common language{''}.
   For this reason, the concept of the property server was developed. On
   this server all corresponding properties, units, measurements, etc. can
   be stored and provided with a machine-readable code.
   In order to demonstrate the application possibilities and the need for
   features, an ideal-typical BIM process along the construction value
   chain is presented. Special attention is paid to the functions and
   possibilities of a property-server. The implementation of this concept
   is shown by means of the property-server developed in the research
   project freeBIM and the software tools implemented in the course of this
   server.
   The concept of a propertyserver makes an essential contribution to the
   optimization of the Open BIM process, but requires a common and
   coordinated approach both in the national and international context.},

Title = {From BIM to digital twin in BIPV: A review of current knowledge},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {67},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Digital solutions, such as digital-twin (DT) technologies, can
   significantly improve the construction industry by addressing its
   inherent challenges, such as complex project management, delays, quality
   control, safety issues, and environmental impact. Building-integrated
   photovoltaics (BIPVs) is a promising system for building envelopes to
   harvest renewable solar energy onsite. Interest in the application of DT
   technologies in BIPV systems has grown, including the prediction and
   optimization of energy performance and accurate diagnosis of faults.
   Despite increased research on the integration of BIPV systems with DT
   technologies, a systematic, holistic analysis that encompasses all
   project phases for effective lifecycle management is still lacking. This
   study comprehensively analyzes the integration of BIPV systems and DT
   technology throughout the building lifecycle, including design,
   construction, operation, demolition, and recycling, and it underscores
   the potential of combining BIPV systems with DT technology as a
   strategic approach to enhance efficiency, safety, and reliability. This
   study investigates three primary objectives: 1) the current
   applications/attempts to apply DTs to BIPV systems from a lifecycle
   perspective; 2) the challenges of integrating DTs and BIPV; and 3)
   promising DT technologies/strategies for promoting BIPV development.
   This study offers significant insights by highlighting the use of DT
   technologies across the full lifecycle of BIPV systems. It details the
   application of these technologies across five crucial layers in BIPV
   systems, data technologies, modelling methods, and simulation
   techniques. Moreover, it elucidates current research gaps in this domain
   and proposes valuable recommendations for future research avenues.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for a big share of the global
   energy, resource demand and greenhouse gas emissions. As such, buildings
   and their designers are key players for carbon mitigation actions.
   Current research in digital fabrication is beginning to reveal its
   potential to improve the sustainability of the construction sector. To
   evaluate the environmental performance of buildings, life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is commonly employed. Recent research developments have
   successfully linked LCA to CAD and BIM tools for a faster evaluation of
   environmental impacts. However, these are only partially applicable to
   digital fabrication, because of differences in the design process. In
   contrast to conventional construction, in digital fabrication the
   geometry is the consequence of the definition of functional, structural
   and fabrication parameters during design. Therefore, this paper presents
   an LCA-based method for design-integrated environmental assessment of
   digitally fabricated building elements. The method is divided into four
   levels of detail following the degree of available information during
   the design process. Finally, the method is applied to the case study
   ``Mesh Mould'', a digitally fabricated complex concrete wall that does
   not require any formwork. The results prove the applicability of the
   method and highlight the environmental benefits digital fabrication can
   provide.},

Title = {A critical review of digital value engineering in building design
   towards automated construction},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Value engineering (VE) has the potential to increase sustainability in
   buildings by optimizing function-to-cost ratios. However, outdated
   manual procedures limit integration and consistency in construction
   projects, necessitating the evaluation of VE automation. This review
   examines VE automation in building design and construction. A systematic
   analysis of 664 publications from major databases was conducted,
   yielding 136 relevant articles. Bibliometric analysis using descriptive
   statistics and keyword mapping identified key VE methodologies and
   building types. Key technologies in VE automation include BIM, advanced
   algorithms, and data integration. These tools enable automated layout
   generation, material selection, and technical configurations, enhancing
   value optimization. BIM serves as a central data platform, improving
   stakeholder collaboration. Algorithms rapidly generate design
   alternatives, optimizing decision-making. Data integration ensures
   accuracy across project stages. Challenges include incomplete databases,
   lifecycle integration issues, and resistance to change. A continuous
   digital VE framework is proposed to address these barriers. This
   framework emphasizes the seamless integration of VE tools with BIM
   platforms, enhancing interoperability and user engagement. In the
   future, there will be further opportunities to advance VE automation
   through the creation of more advanced predictive analytics algorithms,
   more real-time data processing capabilities, and increased
   interoperability amongst various digital tools. The integration of
   machine learning and artificial intelligence into VE processes is also
   suggested to further enhance optimization and efficiency in construction
   projects.},

   information models: Implications for practice},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While the adoption of open Building Information Modeling (open BIM)
   standards continues to grow, the inherent complexity and multifaceted
   nature of the built asset lifecycle data present a critical bottleneck
   for effective information retrieval. To address this challenge, the
   research community has started to investigate advanced natural
   language-based search for building information models. However, the
   accelerated pace of advancements in deep learning-based natural language
   processing research has introduced a complex landscape for
   domain-specific applications, making it challenging to navigate through
   various design choices that accommodate an effective balance between
   prediction accuracy and the accompanying computational costs. This study
   focuses on the semantic tagging of user queries, which is a cardinal
   task for the identification and classification of references related to
   building entities and their specific descriptors. To foster adaptability
   across various applications and disciplines, a semantic annotation
   scheme is introduced that is firmly rooted in the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) schema. By taking a comparative approach, we conducted a
   series of experiments to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   traditional and emergent deep learning architectures for the task at
   hand. Our findings underscore the critical importance of domain-specific
   and context-dependent embedding learning for the effective extraction of
   building entities and their respective descriptions.},

Title = {Temporal dynamic assessment of household energy consumption and carbon

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Global warming has become a challenge and reducing carbon emissions is
   an urgent task. Household energy con-sumption and carbon emissions are
   substantial and need to be analyzed and assessed. Considering the
   significant influence of occupants and the possible dynamic changes
   during the long operation process of buildings, this study proposes a
   dynamic household energy consumption and carbon emissions assessment
   model from the oc-cupant's perspective. The model consists of four
   modules of occupant information collection, energy calculation, machine
   learning models, and dynamic carbon prediction. Five major energy
   sources are assessed: space cooling, space heating, hot water, cooking,
   and domestic appliances. The temporal variations in occupant profiles,
   behav-iors, and the carbon factor of energy are quantified and taken
   into account. The average carbon emissions of a household during
   2020-2060 in three dynamic scenarios are assessed, and general downward
   trends are re-vealed. The specific dynamic carbon levels of ``double
   income, no kids{''} (DINK) households, nuclear households, and
   three-generation households are also quantified, and obvious temporal
   changes and significant differences are found. The influence of China's
   childbearing policy is quantified and discussed. The dynamic assessment
   re-sults are compared with the static results, showing that the largest
   accumulated difference during 41 years can reach 25.1 tCO2-eq. This
   paper proposes an applicable dynamic assessment model from the
   perspective of occupants, with temporal variations considered. The
   assessment results provide a strong reference for future energy-saving
   and emission-reduction plans at the household level.(c) 2023 Institution

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been rapidly transforming the
   Architectural, Engineering, \& Construction (AEC) industry throughout
   the lifecycle of the building. BIM functions as a single database of
   fully integrated and interoperable information that can be used by all
   members of the design and construction team and ultimately, by operators
   throughout a facility's lifecycle (Holenss G.V.R 2008). The advantages
   of utilizing BIM in the Facility Management (FM) stage have been well
   documented in the literature (Stravoravdis and Ashworth 2015.),
   (Gokstorp 2012.) \& (Becerik-Gerber et al. 2012.). The initial
   hypothesis for this study was that the use of BIM by our in-house FM
   staff would significantly reduce the amount of time needed to locate
   HVAC equipment in the building that needs maintenance or repair.
   However, currently, BIM is not as widely implemented in the FM stage as
   it is in the design stage (Akcamete et al 2010.). Lack of or restricted
   access to the BIM model for multiple existing buildings is the first
   major challenge to BIM adoption for FM. The lack of BIM software
   experience for FM personnel and the high purchase cost of the software
   also presents significant challenges. Most of the latest Building
   Management Systems (BMS) inform the FM personnel about the problematic
   equipment through their equipment IDs but fail to locate the coordinates
   of that equipment. The FM personnel mostly use paper-based drawings and
   spend hours locating problematic equipment in the building that is
   flagged by the BMS. For many building managers and design professionals,
   the visualization of building information for analysis, benchmarking,
   and diagnostics remains a time-intensive, do-it-yourself undertaking
   (Lehrer 2010.). Hence, the goal of the study is to provide FM personnel
   with a simple-to-use spatial visualization dashboard that would save
   them time and money. This study showcases a methodology to spatially
   visualize the performance of buildings' HVAC systems systematically. The
   proposed workflow is tested on an existing office building in Utah and
   as part of the scope of the study, only the performance of Variable Air
   Volume (VAV) boxes is spatially visualized. An automated dashboard is
   created for visualizing the VAVs' performance score on a color-coded
   map. As the dashboard is automated to updated regularly, FM personnel
   can track the performance and exact location of the problematic VAVs
   just by opening the dashboard. FM personnel may now infer correlations
   in the equipment failure, by integrating the time and spatial
   relationships on the dashboard. Even though previous studies have
   already dealt with visualizing the sensor data, like temperature, on
   floor plans, the novel idea of this study is to visualize equipment's
   performance on an ongoing basis. Just visualizing the sensor data would
   not help FM personnel diagnose the issue. Future studies may investigate
   ways to scale up the scope of the study to large buildings. Future
   studies may also provide preventive maintenance recommendations on the
   dashboard by analyzing real-time and historical data using machine
   learning techniques.},

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is reshaping the
   construction industry and bringing it into an intelligent construction
   era. Emerging technologies, such as the Building Information Modelling,
   Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, and artificial
   intelligence, have penetrated into all stages of the building life cycle
   and play a significant role. However, the major issue of intelligent
   construction is integrating multiple technologies to create more
   potential opportunities rather than their fragmented application.
   Considering the various special characteristics of the construction
   industry and the high heterogeneity of these technologies, their
   integration in the construction industry is challenging and requires
   in-depth investigations. This paper summarizes the Industry 4.0-related
   technologies involved in the construction industry based on an analysis
   of the characteristics of the industry. Further, this study presents a
   framework of a cyber-physical system to integrate these technologies and
   improve the overall capabilities of construction organization and
   management. A case study of the Xiong'an citizen service center is
   introduced to verify the technological feasibility and preliminary
   implementation effect of the proposed framework. As forward-looking

Title = {Exploring the role of building information modeling in construction
   safety through science mapping},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {456-470},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Deplorable safety management practices are damaging the reputation of
   construction sector. Though legislation has specified rules and
   regulations for safety improvement, the state of violation is still
   alarming. Its root causes are unavailability of information and lack of
   integration of core data with other project activities. The technology
   that can help in overcoming these issues is the need of hour. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) has the potential to address poor safety
   performance which inspired many researchers to explore its application
   for safety improvement throughout project lifecycle. The primary
   objective of this study is to review and analyze the literature on BIM.
   For this purpose, comprehensive bibliometric and scientometric analyses
   were performed using science mapping tools on the articles published
   during the period 2000-2018 using selected search string. The analyses
   on 97 articles majorly resulted in the identification of BIM application
   characteristics, construction safety application domains and their
   relationship. The relationship in the form of a factor-feature matrix
   shows the association strengths between various safety factors and BIM
   features, revealing interesting findings. It is found that visualization
   is the most promising feature of BIM while hazard identification is a

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has emerged as a transformative
   technology in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
   industry, with increasing application in civil infrastructure projects.
   This study comprehensively reviews the research landscape of BIM
   applications in civil infrastructure through bibliometric analysis.
   Based on data from the Web of Science database, 646 relevant papers
   published between 2020 and 2024 were collected, and 416 papers were
   selected for in-depth analysis after screening. Using bibliometric
   methods, the analysis reveals the evolution of research trends,
   identifies key contributors and influential publications, and maps the
   knowledge structure of the field. Our study shows a significant increase
   in research output over the past five years, particularly in studies
   focusing on the integration of BIM with emerging technologies such as
   Digital Twins, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Machine Learning. The
   results indicate that the United States, China, and the United Kingdom
   lead in terms of research output and citation impact. Additionally,
   based on clustering results and representative keywords, several key
   research clusters were identified, including BIM in infrastructure
   lifecycle management, BIM collaboration in large-scale projects, and BIM
   for sustainable infrastructure design.},

Title = {Methodology for service life prediction of architectural concrete
   facades},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {261-274},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In this study, a methodology for the service life prediction of
   architectural concrete facades is proposed, following a research line
   previously developed for other types of claddings, to evaluate their
   durability. The methodology developed is based on the collection of data
   in visual inspections. In this study, 174 facades were analysed, during
   the fieldwork phase, through a survey of the different degradation
   phenomena. This information is used to define degradation curves, which
   graphically express the loss of performance of architectural concrete
   facades over time, evaluating the influence of the degradation agents,
   allowing estimating a reference service life for this type of coating.
   The model proposed in this study leads to acceptable and consistent
   results, adequately translating the degradation observed in reality.
   However, for some characteristics of architectural concrete facades, it
   is not possible to obtain unequivocal conclusions, which reveals the
   high susceptibility of these coatings to the aggressive environmental
   agents, e.g. sea salts, which act simultaneously on the facade,
   hindering the determination of the separate influence of these
   characteristics on the degradation found. This study intends to give a
   contribution to the service life prediction of exterior facades,
   allowing defining rational maintenance plans and reducing the costs
   associated to the buildings refurbishment during their life cycle. (C)

Abstract = {This paper describes a web-enabled repository system that has been
   designed for supporting distributed automotive component development.
   The repository is based on an integrated product and process life-cycle
   information model, derived from ISO standards and using EPISTLE generic
   entity modelling principles. This core model can be used with reference
   data libraries, such as for activities, components, documents and
   properties. The scope and characteristics of the model are described,
   along with its relation to standard product data models and
   classification schemes. Component design and analysis representational
   models are referenced as resources through document meta-data, with
   virtual access via the repository. The modelling approach is compatible
   with the current development of ontologies and topic maps for the
   Semantic Web, with an inter-operability route via the Resource
   Description Framework (RDF). The paper also provides an outline of the
   system architecture, the associated Web tools and the Business Object
   library for building client-server applications. An industrial
   application for fatigue studies is described, illustrating comparison of
   analysis and test data, repository search and provision of best practice
   advice. The aim is to produce a flexible system that can be populated
   and extended directly by engineers, shielding them from the details of
   the information model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM), as an object-oriented tool, has
   been the buzzword in Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   sector in recent years. The buzz has created a lot of promise of an
   imminent paradigm shift and productivity and lifecycle improvements in
   the AEC sector, and plenty of benefits are cited in the literature.
   Consequently, the word has reached the shipbuilding industry as well,
   which faces many similar productivity and lifecycle challenges as the
   AEC industry, and which is seeking similar advancements in digital tools
   that can bring around the change. As a result, the Finnish shipbuilding
   industry expressed interest in exploring what are the BIM-enabled best
   practices in the AEC sector, and which of these can potentially be
   transferred to the shipbuilding industry. This research explored these
   issues. Findings suggest that due to lack of mutual communication, the
   professionals across each industry believe the other to be doing better.},

Title = {BIM in facilities management applications: a case study of a large
   university complex},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {261-277},
Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management
   (FM) applications is an emerging area of research based on the
   theoretical proposition that BIM information, generated and captured
   during the lifecycle of a facility, can improve its management. Using
   this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to
   investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption
   in FM applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two inter-related research methods are
   utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas,
   value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies
   identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence
   of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria
   University's city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and
   challenges of BIM in FM.
   Findings - The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from
   improvement to current manual processes of information handover;
   improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility
   of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main
   challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible
   benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation
   requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the
   interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of
   disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally,
   the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry.
   Originality/value - There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM
   especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing
   only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The
   originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study
   of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and
   challenges of BIM in FM applications.},

   containers for linked document delivery using the shapes constraint
   language},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Information exchange is a crucial process throughout the lifecycle of
   built assets. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and standardized
   information delivery enable exchanging, storing, and linking
   cross-domain information bundled in containers such as the standardized
   Information Container for Linked Document Delivery (ICDD). While
   assessing the quality of the interlinking and metadata is essential to
   allow all parties to interpret an information container correctly, most
   research efforts have focused on code compliance of domain-specific
   models. In order to address this gap, this paper proposes an approach
   for validating ICDD information containers using the Shapes Constraint
   Language (SHACL), the W3C recommendation for Resource Description
   Framework (RDF) data validation. For optimized querying and validation,
   a case study applies SHACL inference rules to the linking structure of
   ICDD to infer predicates between linked entities in four ICDD containers
   in varying dataset sizes and different linking methods. Afterward, the
   validation of these containers is analyzed using three types of
   validation rules with increasing complexity for another SHACL
   implementation. Results show the feasibility of cross domain building
   information validation in ICDD with SHACL and how performance
   enhancements can be obtained on an inferred dataset compared to the
   original dataset.},

   considering different stakeholder categories and detailed social cost
   models. The social impacts and costs estimated in this paper cover a
   multitude of adverse effects on: (a) workplace and traffic safety, (b)
   mobility of people and goods, (c) regional economic growth, (d) dwelling
   environments, and (e) public services. Parameters for the social cost
   estimation are obtained based mainly on various public databases and
   project information. For illustration, the proposed framework is applied
   to quantify the social impacts associated with the construction of a
   residential building and the maintenance of a highway bridge. The study
   shows that the social costs of different construction projects vary
   significantly due to the different stakeholders involved. The
   compositions of diverse social cost components to the total social
   impact are investigated for these two construction projects.},

   real electricity demand: A case study in New York city},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Solar farming has been experiencing explosive development in recent
   years. However, developing solar farming in urban areas is challenged by
   the heterogeneous distribution of solar irradiation in spatial and
   degradation of photovoltaic (PV) efficiency that make the economic
   performance uncertain. To tackle this problem, this study develops a
   spatio-temporal analytic model and a techno-economic assessment model to
   optimize PV provision to ensure that a PV system can meet the
   electricity demand and obtain reasonable profit simultaneously.
   Specifically, based on the estimation of solar potential on
   three-dimensional urban envelopes, the study determines PV favorable
   locations that are quantitatively large and spatially concentrated.
   Then, PV capacities in two comparative architectures, i.e.,
   self-reliance relying on own building surfaces and external-support
   seeking supports from external rooftops, are planned to meet real
   electricity demand. Furthermore, the PV capacity is optimized,
   constrained by a constant electricity rate without Feed-in Tariff, a
   decreasing PV efficiency, and an increasing cost for maintenance. A case
   study in New York City suggests that the optimized PV installation can
   significantly offset household electricity consumption. In addition, the
   estimated net profit is significant even in rigorous conditions, which
   is inspiring for promoting distributed solar harvesting and competing
   with the local electricity market.},

Abstract = {This research contributes to the assessment of on-site fuel consumption
   and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions due to earthworks-related
   processes in residential building projects, prior to the start of the
   construction phase. Several studies have been carried out on this
   subject, and have demonstrated the considerable environmental impact of
   earthworks activities in terms of fuel consumption. However, no methods
   have been proposed to estimate on-site fuel consumption during the
   planning stage. This paper presents a quantitative method to predict
   fuel consumption before the construction phase. The calculations were
   based on information contained in construction project documents and the
   definition of equipment load factors. Load factors were characterized
   for the typical equipment that is used in earthworks in residential
   building projects (excavators, loaders and compactors), taking into
   considering the type of soil, the type of surface and the duration of
   use. We also analyzed transport fuel consumption, because of its high
   impact in terms of pollution. The proposed method was then applied to a
   case study that illustrated its practical use and benefits. The
   predictive method can be used as an assessment tool for residential
   construction projects, to measure the environmental impact in terms of
   on-site fuel consumption. Consequently, it provides a significant basis
   for future methods to compare construction projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {The promise of BIM? Searching for realized benefits in the Nordic
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation industries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Benefits of BIM are not being achieved as expected in the mainstream
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO)
   industries. Here, we aim to contrast expected and realized BIM benefits
   in AECO companies and discuss explanations for why benefits proposed in
   literature have, or have not, been realized. A qualitative research
   approach is applied to collect and analyse interview data from 47
   companies in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Findings show that realized
   benefits typically occur ``within the current practice{''} of individual
   organizations' project-related work. In contrast, expected but not
   realized benefits are long-term, lifecycle oriented and challenge
   current business and practice. Our proposed explanations acknowledge
   that fully realizing the expected benefits of BIM suggested in the
   technology-driven research is restrained by the current sector
   state-of-practice and assumes a high degree of BIM maturity among all
   cooperating companies. Thus, we discuss how explanations relate to the
   fundamental change required to radically leverage the benefits of BIM,
   challenging both current ways of work and the ubiquitous assumption of
   clients as drivers for BIM implementation in the sector. Based on our
   research, we argue that client demand is insufficient to realize the
   promise of BIM. Suggested research implications include a need for
   greater supply-driven logic among suppliers of BIM expert services, and
   the integration of multi-disciplinary competencies within and beyond the
   traditional disciplines. The research demonstrates the gap between
   state-of-the-art BIM predicted in literature and mainstream industry's
   adoption and highlights the importance of extending BIM research to
   better account for socio-organizational and process aspects of benefits
   and adoption.},

Abstract = {In the recent years, energy efficiency issues as well as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) have been the greatest and most challenging
   paradigms for the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AECO)
   industry in the context of Smart Cities. Digital models are used to
   analyse the existing building stock to promote a better management and
   retrofitting actions. Data modelling is the first step to pursue an
   integrated approach for the building lifecycle allowing simulations and
   analysis for different purposes through the interoperability process.
   This study aims to investigate the potential and the limitations of a
   BIM-based energy analysis by means of an Italian commonly used software
   for energy diagnosis and certificates, according to the quasi-steady
   method specified in the UNI/TS 11300-1: 2008. The case study is a
   library with municipal offices in Settimo Torinese (Italy), which is the
   demonstrator of the ongoing Zero Energy Buildings in Smart Urban
   Districts (EEB) national cluster, which has the main scope to create a
   data management infrastructure able to integrate heterogeneous networks.
   The energy rate is evaluated from a simplified Revit architectural
   model, where the most significant components of the building in terms of
   energy are defined with a proper Level of Detail/Development (LOD) to
   easily set the energy model through the EC770 plug-in. In this way, the
   acquisition of geometrical data is allowed by the interoperability among
   software, speeding up the redundant preliminary phases of the simulation
   concerning the description of the building envelope. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Adoption of Blockchain Technology through Digital Twins in the
   Construction Industry 4.0: A PESTELS Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction,
   operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust,
   inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain
   into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This
   paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of
   blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM
   industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information
   management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach
   is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges
   affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the
   technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS
   analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors
   affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a
   technological framework-namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle
   (DDTC)-that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and
   to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency,
   traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects'
   lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT
   with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things
   (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework
   offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around
   network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability,
   energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with
   IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects' lifecycles. The model also
   considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the
   circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key
   technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the
   DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works.
   Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and
   technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address
   the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry
   4.0.},

Abstract = {Despite widespread promotion of green construction technology, its
   adoption continues to face obstacles. The purpose of this research is to
   investigate and better understand the risks involved with the
   construction of sustainable projects, as well as to identify the most
   important barriers to the adoption of green building. A thorough
   literature analysis was undertaken, and questionnaires were distributed
   to 129 building experts. 48 risk variables were considered and
   categorized into six categories. The ranking analysis identified 29 risk
   variables as essential. The top five most important risk variables are
   as follows: Inadequate green construction codes and regulations, a lack
   of information and understanding about new techniques, difficulties
   gaining skills and expertise, and a lack of funding due to a lack of
   interest in the local market all contribute to a lack of investment.
   According to the study, the most severe obstacles are located in Qatar
   and a few other nations, including the UAE, Singapore, Ghana, the United
   States, Turkey, and Oman. This indicates that similar risk factors
   impacting green adoption exist not just in the Qatari construction
   sector, but also in the building industries of many other nations.
   Furthermore, limited investment due to a lack of demand remains one of
   the top five recognized challenges to green adoption, particularly in
   the Gulf regions. This study investigates the relationship between
   categories and the correlation between risk factors, established a solid

Abstract = {This study investigates the implementation of design reuse and buffers
   in developing the infrastructure of high-tech production facilities
   Design reuse entails using the same systems architecture from one
   project to the next. Design buffers involve building slack into a proven
   systems architecture to absorb foreseeable change requests. Choosing the
   appropriate amounts of reuse and slack is dependent on the uncertainty
   in the manufacturing technology over the infrastructure life cycle.
   While proven infrastructure designs can economically accommodate
   incremental changes in technology, adaptation costs escalate when
   sufficient buffers are not built-in and changes are radical. We uncover
   opposing stakeholder interests in determining the extent to which reuse
   or buffers are used. Design reuse is attractive to the client to reduce
   the risk that a facility fails to perform, but limits the designer's job
   to tedious customization work. Design buffers are attractive to the
   designer to do original problem-solving and limit the risks of being
   unresponsive to uncertainty, but not to the client who is not guaranteed
   that the investments will pay off. We find that inequalities between the
   two stakeholders in the governing power on design decision-making
   compound the difficulties in assessing and implementing the reuse versus
   buffers tradeoff.},

Title = {Development of an IoT and BIM-based automated alert system for thermal
   comfort monitoring in buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A comfortable thermal indoor environment is crucial for occupants?
   well-being and productivity. Building Management System (BMS) is usually
   used to monitor the thermal condition of buildings. One of BMS?s main
   challenges is in the data visualization stage, in which 2D vector
   graphics are used, which is not fully interactive and can only be
   manipulated by a trained operator. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   has emerged as a useful tool in the construction industry, which can be
   applied in all stages of a project lifecycle. The use of BIM in
   facilities management is currently limited since BIM applications have
   primarily been implemented within the design and construction phases.
   The main objective of this study is to integrate a sensor-based alert
   system into BIM models for thermal comfort monitoring in buildings
   during the operational phase and visualize a building?s thermal
   condition virtually. In order to improve the performance of
   environmental monitoring management of buildings in smart cities, this
   research presents a newly developed integrated solution based on a BIM
   platform and Internet of Things (IoT). The designed prototype explores
   the integration of commercial BIM platforms with sensor data to create a
   self-updating BIM model to provide real-time thermal condition
   monitoring based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and
   Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard within an office
   environment. The temperature and humidity values, measured by sensors,
   are sent to the MySQL database server. An integrated workflow was
   developed to compile, standardize, integrate, and visualize monitoring
   data in a BIM environment to facilitate interpretation, analysis, and
   monitoring data exchange. The developed system was able to detect the
   time and location of a case study office room experiencing the levels of
   thermal comfort/discomfort based on the targeted thresholds. In this
   case, thirteen levels of thermal discomfort cases, out of forty-nine
   data points during the test, were detected, and the developed system was
   also able to generate a trigger and transmit alarms to facility managers
   via their wireless devices in real-time. The results demonstrate that
   the proposed system is a visually effective monitoring system for
   environmental monitoring management. The fully automated developed
   system is expected to provide a robust and practical tool for reliable
   data collection, analysis, and visualization to facilitate intelligent
   monitoring of the thermal condition in buildings and help
   decision-makers make faster and better decisions, which may help in
   maintaining the level of occupants? thermal comfort to a satisfactory
   level.},

Title = {Exploring the Role of BIM in Construction Safety in Developing
   Countries: Toward Automated Hazard Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Safety is a well-researched yet underperforming management aspect of the
   construction industry. Building information modeling (BIM) can help, and
   some frameworks have addressed safety management in limited phases of
   the project lifecycle. This study positions BIM centrally in the safety
   management process and develops a safety management framework that
   covers the entire lifecycle of a construction project in the context of
   developing countries. A systematic literature review is conducted to
   identify the safety factors and BIM features that are synthesized to
   devise BIM-based safety improvement strategies. The strategies are
   presented to construction management professionals from developed and
   developing countries through an online questionnaire survey, and their
   level of agreement is identified. Afterward, construction safety experts
   are engaged to integrate these strategies into appropriate lifecycle
   phases. Additionally, these experts are also engaged to develop an
   automated hazard recognition process to leverage BIM potential in safety
   management. The integration of strategies into project lifecycle phases
   resulted in a comprehensive safety implementation framework leveraging
   the BIM platform. This framework takes a lead from the experience of
   developed countries and considers the limitations of developing
   countries in terms of resources and technology. Furthermore, a BIM-based
   process map for hazard identification is developed. The process map
   takes the BIM model as input and provides a detailed safety report. The
   process map can be automated to enhance effective safety management.
   This study expands the body of knowledge through a BIM-driven lifecycle
   safety management framework for developing countries where BIM adoption
   is still in its early stages. It is a fresh take on safety automation to
   make the construction industry safer and more reliable. However, it is
   limited due to inadequate safety reporting and documentation in
   developing countries. Future research can improve upon this limitation
   by positioning in a safety-compliant culture.},

Title = {Carbon reduction benefits of photovoltaic-green roofs and their climate
   change mitigation potential: A case study of Xiamen city},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The Photovoltaic-Green Roof (PV-GR) system, which integrates rooftop
   photovoltaics and green roofing, has significant potential for
   sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation. However,
   the specific effects of PV-GR are not yet clear. This paper employs
   methodologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
   Denitrification-Decomposition(DNDC) Model, and solar simulation.
   Combined with ecological balance calculations, these methods assess
   PV-GR's carbon reduction benefits and its potential to mitigate climate
   change. Using Xiamen City as a case study, research shows that Xiamen
   has about 54 km2 of rooftops suitable for PV-GR. Annually, PV-GR can
   produce about 5.931x103 tons of biomass and generate 7,427 GWh of
   electricity, meeting about 22.13 \% of Xiamen's annual electricity
   demand. The annual carbon reduction from Xiamen's PVGR is estimated at
   about 5.131x106 t CO2-eq, offsetting around 29.28 \% of the city's
   annual carbon emissions. Over a 30-year lifecycle, PV-GR's carbon
   emissions and reduction benefits amount to 2.274x107 t CO2-eq and
   1.539x108 t CO2-eq, respectively. The ecological footprint of deploying
   PV-GR in Xiamen is 6.709x104 Gha, while the biocapacity reaches
   4.542x105 Gha. The global ecological balance stands at 3.872x105 Gha,
   suggesting that PV-GR can significantly contribute to mitigating climate
   change.},

Abstract = {In the face of contemporary challenges, such as economic instability,
   environmental degradation, and the urgent global warming crisis, the
   imperative of sustainability and energy efficiency has reached
   unparalleled significance. Sustainability encompasses not only the
   natural environment, but also extends to our immediate surroundings,
   including the built structures and the communities they serve. Embracing
   this comprehensive perspective, we embarked on a mission to conceive and
   construct a model house that harnesses state-of-the-art energy-efficient
   technologies. Our goal was to seamlessly integrate these features not
   only to meet our sustainability objectives, but also to mitigate
   environmental threats.This model embodies a harmonious fusion of
   indigenous resources, employing locally sourced stone and employing
   traditional construction techniques. Through this approach, we achieved
   significant reductions in carbon emissions and established a framework
   for passive cooling and heating systems. Moreover, the design is
   intrinsically attuned to its contextual surroundings, preserving the
   diverse tapestry of regional architectural styles. This study stands as
   a testament to the potential of innovative design and technology in
   shaping a sustainable future. The research employs a multi-dimensional
   approach, encompassing strategies of architectural design with a
   traditional planning approach, sustainable material selection, energy
   efficiency, and life cycle assessment across a diverse set of case
   studies. Building energy analysis is conducted through the application
   of BIM (Ecotect), providing insights into how BIM can adapt and thrive
   in various environments. Key findings underscore that thermal
   performance, minimizing energy loads, and reducing carbon emissions are
   pivotal aspects in designating a building as both green and energy
   efficient.},

Title = {Enabling circularity in Turkish construction: a case of BIM-based
   material management utilizing material passports},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 27},
Abstract = {PurposeThe Turkish construction sector, facing mounting environmental
   pressures, needs to rapidly adopt circular economy (CE) principles.
   However, a critical barrier is the lack of accessible and comprehensive
   material information. This paper investigates how building information
   modeling (BIM) can facilitate the adoption of material passports (MPs)
   to overcome this challenge and helps enabling circularity in Turkish
   construction.Design/methodology/approachA case study approach is
   adopted, focusing on the New Istanbul Esenler Arena, a major sports
   facility designed with BIM. An in-depth analysis of the project's BIM
   model and material data was conducted to develop a practical framework
   for integrating MPs into BIM workflows. The framework outlines a
   comprehensive MP data structure, addresses technical integration
   strategies and highlights the importance of stakeholder
   collaboration.FindingsThe research demonstrates that integrating MPs
   with BIM has the potential to significantly enhance material tracking
   throughout the building lifecycle, leading to more informed
   decision-making regarding material selection, reuse and recycling. This
   approach can improve material recovery rates, reduce construction waste
   and minimize the environmental impact of construction projects. The
   study also identifies key challenges to MP implementation, such as
   ensuring data accuracy and interoperability, and proposes strategies to
   overcome these hurdles.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the
   limited but growing body of knowledge on the practical implementation of
   BIM and MPs for circular construction, particularly in the Turkish
   context. The proposed framework, informed by a real-world case study,
   provides valuable guidance for construction professionals, policymakers
   and researchers seeking to accelerate the transition to a circular
   economy in the built environment.},

Abstract = {The service life of cement-rendered facades is closely related to the
   environmental conditions to which they are exposed. The probability
   distribution is determined for the degradation condition of render
   facades considering different environmental exposures. A sample of 100
   render facades was subjected to meticulous fieldwork to determine their
   condition. The analysis focuses on the environmental factors that most
   influence the overall degradation of the facades, evaluated through the
   condition level. Probabilistic models based on Markov chains are
   developed to predict the evolution of facade deterioration according to
   exposure to outdoor environmental conditions. The proposed model
   provides data on the synergy between the degradation agents and the
   degradation condition of render facades, the average time of permanence
   in each degradation level, and indications of the effect of degradation
   on the durability of render that may be applied in the implementation
   and fine-tuning of maintenance procedures. A better understanding of the
   durability of render facades allows a more rational management of their
   maintenance, contributing to a reduction of their life cycle costs. The
   proposed stochastic model provides information that can be applied in
   the context of insurance policies, allowing an evaluation of the risk of
   failure of coatings.},

Abstract = {Building on theories of cue utilization, this paper investigates whether
   and how packaging sustainability influences consumer perceptions,
   inferences and attitudes towards packaged products. A framework is
   tested in an empirical study among 249 students using soup products
   varying in packaging material and graphics. The findings show that
   (packaging) sustainability is a highly salient association but is only
   moderately important for consumer attitudes. A comparison between
   consumer judgments and life cycle assessment indicates that consumers
   rely on misleading, inaccurate lay beliefs to judge packaging
   sustainability and are therefore susceptible to making ineffective
   environmental decisions. The research also demonstrates the power of
   packaging in shaping perceptions of food products. Particularly, it
   shows that changes in actual environmental impacts (by altering
   packaging materials) affect not only sustainability perceptions but also
   several other benefits, such as perceived taste and quality. At the same
   time, consumers' sustainability assessments are also highly influenced
   by mere graphical packaging cues that have no obvious actual
   sustainability consequences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs), as the most recognized data schema
   for Building Information Modeling (BIM), are increasingly combined with
   ontology to facilitate data interoperability across the whole lifecycle
   in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC/FM). This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of 122 papers from
   the perspective of data, model, and application to summarize the modes
   of IFC and ontology integration (IFCOI). This paper first analyzes the
   data and models of the integration from IFC data formats and ontology
   development models to the IfcOWL data model. Next, the application
   status is summed up from objective and phase dimensions, and four
   frequent applications with maturity are identified. Based on the
   aforementioned multi-dimensional analysis, three integration modes are
   summarized, taking into account various data interoperability
   requirements. Accordingly, ontology behaves as the representation of
   domain knowledge, an enrichment tool for IFC model semantics, and a
   linkage between IFC data and other heterogeneous data. Finally, this
   paper points out the challenges and opportunities for IFCOI in the data,
   domain ontology, and integration process and proposes a building
   lifecycle management model based on IFCOI.},

Abstract = {Building prefabrication is facing the challenge to reduce the life-cycle
   impact of construction, enhance material circularity, and increase the
   quality of building products and processes. The paper presents the first
   phase of the research CARES - CArdboard RElocatable School developed
   with the Italian brand Archicart by Area S.r.l with the aim to prototype
   a temporary school unit. The work presented is focused on the
   industrialization of a prefabricated building technology based on the
   use of cardboard panels (PACOTECTM Stre-Wall panels). Cardboard is a
   circular and environmentally sustainable material but currently the
   design and manufacturing process lacks digital integration, resulting in
   poor quality control, limited adaptability, and lack of material
   optimization. To address sustainability goals, the work implemented a
   ``file-to-factory{''} approach to redesign the design-manufacturing
   process of prefabricated cardboard panels, integrating industry 4.0
   paradigms in manufacturing (automation, high-precision manufacturing)
   and the use of BIM tools for design to achieve better product-process
   quality and predictability. The redesigned workflow allows achieving
   sustainability goals, such as reduction of errors, reduction of material
   wastes, cost and time predictability, product customization, and
   adaptability. The workflow will be verified and tested in the design and
   manufacturing of prefabricated cardboard panels to build a temporary
   school unit.},

Title = {Developing a framework for building maintenance: a case study of
   Malaysia's low-cost housing via soft system methodology},

Abstract = {Purpose The cost of residential building maintenance can harmfully
   affect low-income earners' expenditure if not checked. A customised
   maintenance concept via a framework will ensure efficient and proper
   building maintenance operations. The outcome may keep the life cycle
   cost down. Studies concerning the low-cost housing (LCH) maintenance
   concept through a framework are scarce in Malaysia. Thus, the study aims
   to investigate the state of LCH and develop a framework to improve LCH
   maintenance practices in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach The study
   adopted a soft system methodology (SSM) to comprehend Malaysia's LCH
   building maintenance practices. The SSM allowed an alternative approach
   to improve LCH maintenance practices via a developed framework. Virtual
   interviews were conducted with experts, and findings were presented. It
   was in line with the SSM seven steps. Findings The findings show that
   apart from the poor state of LCH maintenance, there is the absence of a
   framework to improve maintenance practices, especially in LCH across
   Malaysia's cities. The findings developed a framework that would
   reposition the joint management body and management corporation in
   collaboration with the proposed maintenance agency for better service
   delivery via substantive, technical and administrative aspects. Research
   limitations/implications This study's data collection is restricted to
   Pulau Pinang, Kuala Lumpur and Johor through a qualitative research
   design approach. Future research is needed to consider more extensive
   coverage and validate the developed framework from this study via a
   quantitative research design. Practical implications Apart from the
   conceptual model that was developed, the suggested framework can be
   employed by Malaysia's maintenance practitioners and policymakers as a
   guideline to improve LCH building maintenance practices across the
   cities. Originality/value This study examined Malaysia's LCH maintenance
   practices via SSM to identify the state of the houses, identify the
   information required and propose a suitable framework to improve
   Malaysia's LCH maintenance practices.},

Title = {Conceptualizing the built environment as a social-ecological system},
Journal = {BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {248-268},
Abstract = {Formulating a unified theory of the built environment may require that
   the built environment be understood as a complex social-ecological
   system, where multiple-related metabolisms interact at different scales.
   From this broad systems perspective, the dividing line between what is
   considered as nature and what is considered as built environment becomes
   a cultural attribute that changes with the historical context. Over the
   past four centuries, notions of environmental accounting and material
   metabolism have expanded from year-to-year economic and biological
   exchanges to energy, material, financial, and information flows extended
   through time and space. At present, the necessary extension of system
   limits in time and space is best achieved by combining a number of
   methods, including flow-based models and resource-conservation-based
   models, and top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches. Artefacts,
   flows, and actors can be linked over time by means of a common framework
   for describing the built environment, and by life cycle-oriented product
   modelling techniques. Despite such advances, existing theory seems
   incapable of fully integrating spatial and physical relationships, and
   is especially challenged when dealing with concepts of time. Ecological
   models provide a useful basis for new timing tools that integrate
   different time scales, past and future, and that allow for an assessment
   of adaptive capacity and other aspects of system resiliency. These
   models can be used to understand better the impact of different
   managerial and social policies at both the macro- and the micro-level.
   The management of the long-term evolution of this social-ecological
   system can only be assured through appropriating ecological concepts of
   time, and by integrating the history of nature with the history of human
   culture.},

Abstract = {Remote working proved to be an advantage in terms energy-saving as well
   as, for many, in terms of quality of life, while it was a necessity
   during the pandemic crisis of 2020/2021. This new habit is now promoted
   by many big enterprises due to associated cost savings. Some experiences
   of remote working in different locations have started to be supported by
   incentives in small municipalities to repopulate remote locations in
   Italy and people are now more inclined to move not just for vacation.
   These conditions could lead to a sort of ``climatic nomadism{''}
   achievable, among other, through transportable homes. The net-zero
   energy Green and Transportable Modular Building (GTMB) project is able
   to cut its environmental impact. It can assume different configurations
   according to the user's needs. The house is based on a timber
   construction system, easily adjustable and adaptable according to a
   modular framework. The energy performance has been simulated by means of

Abstract = {Hardware security creates a hardware-based security foundation for
   secure and reliable operation of systems and applications used in our
   modern life. The presence of design for security, security assurance,
   and general security design life cycle practices in product life cycle
   of many large semiconductor design and manufacturing companies these
   days indicates that the importance of hardware security has been very
   well observed in industry. However, the high cost, time, and effort for
   building security into designs and assuring their security - due to
   using many manual processes - is still an important obstacle for economy
   of secure product development. This paper presents several promising
   directions for automation of design for security and security assurance
   practices to reduce the overall time and cost of secure product
   development. First, we present security verification challenges of SoCs,
   possible vulnerabilities that could be introduced inadvertently by tools
   mapping a design model in one level of abstraction to its lower level,
   and our solution to the problem by automatically mapping security
   properties from one level to its lower level incorporating techniques
   for extension and expansion of the properties. Then, we discuss the
   foundation necessary for further automation of formal security analysis
   of a design by incorporating threat model and common security
   vulnerabilities into an intermediate representation of a hardware model
   to be used to automatically determine if there is a chance for direct or
   indirect flow of information to compromise confidentiality or integrity
   of security assets. Finally, we discuss a pre-silicon-based framework
   for practical and time-and-cost effective power-side channel leakage
   analysis, root-causing the side-channel leakage by using the
   automatically generated leakage profile of circuit nodes, providing
   insight to mitigate the side-channel leakage by addressing the high
   leakage nodes, and assuring the effectiveness of the mitigation by
   reprofiling the leakage to prove its acceptable level of elimination. We
   hope that sharing these efforts and ideas with the security research
   community can accelerate the evolution of security-aware CAD tools
   targeted to design for security and security assurance to enrich the
   ecosystem to have tools from multiple vendors with more capabilities and
   higher performance.},

Abstract = {Undergraduate education in Building Information Modeling (BIM) area for
   Civil Engineering and Management (CEM) majors cultivates the students'
   abilities to handle the embedded context constraints, parametric
   modeling, and the corresponding education guidelines recommended by the
   assessment associations and agencies. This study focuses on the expected
   cognitive structure and the training contents of BIM education. The
   objective of this research is to design, implement, and adjust the
   subject areas of BIM courses to prepare students for the skills expected
   by job market. The authors studied the overlap of the scopes between
   undergraduate BIM education and the job market expectations on the skill
   structure of BIM abilities. The authors also reviewed the 2013 China
   Civil Engineering and Management Undergraduate Education Guideline (2013
   CCEMUEG). Particularly, the authors developed the BIM cognitive
   structure concept and the unique, BIM-embedded, education knowledge tree
   in CEM major. To design the training contents, the authors adopted the
   Quality-Function-Development (QFD) house concept and its relationship
   principles, designed the knowledge units and knowledge points of 2013
   CCEMUEG with the different corresponding encodings, constructed a path
   between BIM ability structure and CEM education, and performed the
   feasibility study of the implementation scheme. The research results
   include the blueprint of curriculum development and the knowledge
   framework showing the comparison of characteristics between BIM and 2013
   CCEMUEG knowledge units and knowledge points. In conclusion, the
   research suggests that BIM education in CEM could be implemented in the
   whole undergraduate learning process, representing the life-span of
   construction/building projects. This research shines light on BIM
   education in CEM. Its analysis tool and knowledge tree will be a
   powerful revelation for the pedagogical design of BIM in undergraduate
   education.},

Title = {Building matrix population models when individuals are non-identifiable},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {460},
Pages = {13-17},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Matrix Population Models (MPM) are among the most widely used tools in
   ecology and evolution. These models consider the life cycle of an
   individual as composed by states to construct a matrix containing the
   likelihood of transitions between these states as well as sexual and/or
   asexual per-capita offspring contributions. When individuals are
   identifiable one can parametrize an MPM based on survival and fertility
   data and average development times for every state, but some of this
   information is absent or incomplete for non-cohort data, or for cohort
   data when individuals are not identifiable. Here we introduce a simple
   procedure for the parameterization of an MPM that can be used with
   cohort data when individuals are non-identifiable; among other aspects
   our procedure is a novelty in that it does not require information on
   stage development (or stage residence) times, which current procedures
   require to be estimated externally, and it is a frequent source of
   error. We exemplify the procedure with a laboratory cohort dataset from
   Eratyrus mucronatus (Reduviidae, Triatominae). We also show that even if
   individuals are identifiable and the duration of each stage is
   externally estimated with no error, our procedure is simpler to use and
   yields the same MPM parameter estimates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Purpose - Circular economy (CE) and offsite construction (OSC) are two
   innovations for improving the construction industry's overall
   performance against a myriad of sustainability-driven
   agenda/initiatives. There is a real opportunity to conjoin OSC and CE to
   provide new insight and opportunities to deliver more evidence-based
   sustainable systems. This study analyses extant literature in CE and OSC
   (between 2000 and 2021) through a bibliometric review to tease out
   critical measures for their integration and
   transformation.Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a science
   mapping quantitative literature review approach employing bibliometric
   and visualisation techniques to systematically investigate data. The Web
   of Science (WoS) database was used to collect data, and the VOSviewer
   software to analyse the data collected to determine strengths, weights,
   clusters and research trends in OSC and CE.Findings - Important findings
   emerging from the study include extensive focus on sustainability,
   waste, life cycle assessment and building information modelling (BIM),
   which currently serve as strong interlinks to integrate OSC and CE.
   Circular business models, deconstruction and supply chain management are
   emerging areas, with strong links for integrating CE and OSC. These
   emerging areas influence organisational and operational decisions
   towards sustainable value creation, hence requiring more future
   empirical investigations.Originality/value - This study is a novel
   research using bibliometric analysis to unpick underpinning conduits for
   integrating CE and OSC, providing a blueprint for circular OSC future
   research and practice. It provides the needed awareness to develop
   viable strategies for integrating CE in OSC, creating opportunities to
   transition to more sustainable systems in the construction sector.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {599-612},

Abstract = {Hydraulic structures, such as ship locks and weirs, form an essential
   part of waterway networks. An efficient life-cycle management is
   necessary to manage these large concrete structures safely and
   economically. Inspections and material testing form an important part of
   this process, as they enable an improved assessment of the condition,
   materials and properties of the structure. Traditionally, the limited
   data from tests is used to estimate probability distributions of
   material parameters; characteristic values for the assessment are then
   obtained from these distributions. Spatial correlation between
   measurement locations or different material layers is typically
   neglected. In this contribution, the spatially variable material
   parameters are modelled with random fields. The available data from
   local measurements is used to update the distribution of the random
   fields using Bayesian analysis. For comparison, the approach of Eurocode
   0 for obtaining characteristic values is also applied. The structural
   reliability is then calculated applying subset simulation. It is shown
   that the employed random field modelling approach provides a more
   detailed statement about the material parameters. The results of an
   application to a ship lock wall demonstrate that modelling the spatial
   variability of concrete properties can increase the reliability estimate
   of large hydraulic structures when measurement information is included.},

Abstract = {Purpose At the end of a building's lifecycle, there are several
   limitations to the decision-making process (DMP). There is a lack of
   data available from the building's history, the difficulty in assessing
   the condition of a building and the variety of stakeholders' needs that
   have to be satisfied. The purpose of this paper is to answer the
   question: how would end-of-life (EOL) DMP change when buildings will
   have been digitally built? The answer will be illustrated through a
   conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative analysis
   of the existing literature has been performed to identify the elements
   within building information modelling (BIM) and advanced digital
   technologies that could be of support to the DMP. The findings have been
   collected and summarised in a conceptual framework that has been
   validated and enhanced through online interviews with industry experts.
   Findings The enhanced framework has identified that BIM technology would
   bring the benefit of providing the initial digital data source, from
   which machine learning and data analytics would then extract the
   relevant data needed to measure accurately the criteria during the
   analysis of the EOL options put on the table. Originality/value The
   findings of this research could contribute to developing the software
   modules making the bridge between BIM and machine learning technologies,
   to implement them in the EOL DMP.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is a striking development
   in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, which
   provides in-depth information on different stages of the building
   lifecycle. Real estate valuation, as a fully interconnected field with
   the AEC industry, can benefit from 3D technical achievements in BIM
   technologies. Some studies have attempted to use BIM for real estate
   valuation procedures. However, there is still a limited understanding of
   appropriate mechanisms to utilize BIM for valuation purposes and the
   consequent impact that BIM can have on decreasing the existing
   uncertainties in the valuation methods. Therefore, the paper aims to
   analyze the literature on BIM for real estate valuation practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a systematic review to
   analyze existing utilizations of BIM for real estate valuation
   practices, discovers the challenges, limitations and gaps of the current
   applications and presents potential domains for future investigations.
   Research was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar
   databases to find relevant references that could contribute to the
   study. A total of 52 publications including journal papers, conference
   papers and proceedings, book chapters and PhD and master's theses were
   identified and thoroughly reviewed. There was no limitation on the
   starting date of research, but the end date was May 2022. Findings -
   Four domains of application have been identified: (1) developing machine
   learning-based valuation models using the variables that could directly
   be captured through BIM and industry foundation classes (IFC) data
   instances of building objects and their attributes; (2) evaluating the
   capacity of 3D factors extractable from BIM and 3D GIS in increasing the
   accuracy of existing valuation models; (3) employing BIM for accurate
   estimation of components of cost approach-based valuation practices; and
   (4) extraction of useful visual features for real estate valuation from
   BIM representations instead of 2D images through deep learning and
   computer vision. Originality/value - This paper contributes to research
   efforts on utilization of 3D modeling in real estate valuation
   practices. In this regard, this paper presents a broad overview of the
   current applications of BIM for valuation procedures and provides
   potential ways forward for future investigations.},

Title = {BIM in the operations stage: bottlenecks and implications for owners},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {331-343},
Abstract = {Purpose - The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the
   Netherlands is increasing. Studies show that BIM is mainly used in the
   lifecycle stages of initiation, development and realisation. Owners and
   operators are presumably yet to discover the added value of BIM for
   maintenance and information management within their organisations. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate information management during
   the operations stage from the viewpoint of owners and determines the
   added value of BIM within this growing field of construction.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on a literature
   review, explorative interviews and process modelling. In total, 21
   semi-structured interviews were conducted among public real estate and
   infrastructure owners and operators, software companies, service
   providers and contractors.
   Findings - This paper provides empirical insights into the sources of
   inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the activities of Dutch semi-public
   and public clients. It finds that the current added value of BIM in the
   operations stage is marginal. The main reasons for this are a lack of
   alignment between the supply of and demand for information and the
   context-dependent role of information.
   Practical implications - The authors propose a structured approach that
   supports client organisations in establishing greater alignment between
   the supply of and demand for information, and a less context-dependent
   role for information during the operations stage.
   Originality/value - In contrast to previous studies, this paper offers a
   new perspective on BIM in the operations stage, a growing field of
   interest in practice and science.},

Title = {Two-Level Quality Decision Support System for Building Structural Damage
   Prediction and Maintenance Solution Recommendation in the Operation and
   Maintenance Phase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Traditional building quality management in the operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) phase of the building life cycle has concentrated on inspection
   of quality defects by using new equipment or methods. However, there has
   been little research in terms of predicting a building's structural
   quality problems and suggesting related feasible maintenance solutions.
   This study proposes a two-level building quality decision support system
   (DSS) using the hybrid feature selection and least-squares twin support
   vector machine algorithms to predict structural damage types and damage
   causes and suggest maintenance solutions for a building. The basic-level
   building quality DSS model, which can be regarded a predictive
   maintenance system, predicts the probable changes in structural damage
   types over time as a means of reminding building maintenance
   practitioners to pay close attention to the most probable damage
   requiring maintenance at different times. The inspection-level building
   quality DSS model, which can be treated as a proactive maintenance
   system, predicts the probabilities of structural damage causes and
   suggests related maintenance solutions. This research can further
   enhance the accuracy of structural damage cause analysis and establish
   valid maintenance solutions for inspectors. In addition, it can help to
   optimize the design and construction processes of buildings, which will
   further decrease structural quality defects in the O\&M phase.},

Title = {Towards a semantic Construction Digital Twin: Directions for future
   research},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing
   the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and
   operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies
   dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks,
   management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems
   underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and
   optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency
   of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated
   technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of
   our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures,
   technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic
   representation of building components and systems, the concept of a
   Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and
   process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by
   leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data
   flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as
   control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban
   artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic,
   scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different
   levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during
   the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving
   the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of
   such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning
   research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

Title = {A centralised cost management system: exploiting EVM and ABC within IPD},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {549-569},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Purpose Integrated project delivery (IPD) is highly recommended to be
   utilised with building information management (BIM), specifically with
   BIM level-3 implementation process. Extant literature highlights the
   financial management challenges facing the proposed integration. These
   challenges are mainly related to the IPD compensation and the
   conventional cost control approaches that are not consistent with IPD
   principles. As such, this paper presents an integration of several
   methods to support automating risk/reward sharing amongst project
   parties thus enhancing IPD core team members' relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach The literature review was used to highlight
   the challenges that face the IPD-based cost management practices such as
   the risk sharing/reward sharing amongst IPD core team members and
   potential methods to bridge the revealed IPD gap. A framework was
   developed by integrating the activity-based costing (ABC) - as a method
   to analyse the cost structure - and earned value management (EVM) to
   develop mathematical models that can determine the three main IPD
   financial transactions (i.e. horizontal ellipsis ) fairly. To
   demonstrate the applicability of the developed system, a real-life case
   study was used, in which, promising results were collected in regard to
   visualising the cost control data and understanding of the accumulative
   status of the project cost and schedule for team members. Findings A
   centralised cost management system (CCMS) for IPD is developed to enable
   the IPD cost structure as well as automating the
   risk-sharing/reward-sharing calculations. This system is linked with a
   web-based management system to display the output of proposed
   risk-sharing/reward-sharing models. Moreover, a novel grid is developed
   to show the project status graphically and to respect the diversity in
   core team members backgrounds. In addition, the case study showed that
   the proposed integration of different methods (ABC, EVM, BIM and
   web-based management system) is interoperable and applicable.
   Originality/value This research presents a comprehensive solution to the
   most revealed challenges in cost management practices in IPD
   implementation. The outcome of this research contributes to the body of
   knowledge through presenting new extensions of the EVM to be used with
   the IPD approach to calculate risk/reward. Moreover, the implementation
   of the proposed tools such as centralised cost management system (CCMS)
   and CCMS for IPD web system will enhance/foster the implementation of
   the IPD in conjunction with BIM process.},

Abstract = {The development of information technology continues to evolve to respond
   the increasing demand and challenges in the construction industry.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) emerges in recent years as the
   fresh solution to make the project lifecycle more efficient by
   encouraging collaborative working of all stakeholders involved in the
   construction project, i.e. owners, consultants, and contractors. This
   study aims to investigate BIM adoption and implementation in Indonesia
   construction industry and explore challenges and opportunities related
   to the implementation of BIM. A combination of qualitative and
   quantitative research method has been adopted for this exploratory
   research. Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires
   survey with snowball sampling from twenty entities, consisting of 12
   contractors, 4 consultants, and 4 owners. The results show that 60\% of
   respondents have already acknowledged and implemented BIM. The examples
   of BIM software used by the respondents include Revit, Tekla, and
   SmartPlan (R). Benefits of BIM implementation as perceived by most
   respondents, e.g. design collision detection, clear project simulation,
   reduced reworks, and efficient use of resources. The adoption of BIM,
   however, still faces challenges, such as the absence of requirement and
   demand, and high investment cost. This research provides an initial
   understanding of current BIM adoption in Indonesia, which can be used as
   the basis to develop a national strategic framework for BIM adoption in
   Indonesia construction industry.},

Abstract = {As society has progressed through periods of evolution and revolution,
   technology has played a key role as an enabler. In the same manner,
   mechanical machines of the 1800s drove the industrial revolution, now
   digitalized machines are driving another industrial revolution.
   Manufacturers are increasing the digital footprint on the factory floor.
   It is challenging to harness the vast amounts of data generated, stored,
   analyzed, archived, and returned. Data centralization has several
   well-known challenges, such as collection bottlenecks, secure retrieval,
   single point of failure, and data scheme fragility as data heterogeneity
   increases. This paper proposes a method of information distribution
   based on the principle of data at its source. It proposes that
   contextual data be used at runtime through the creation of dynamic
   queries that build compositions of different systems. Such system of
   systems (SoS) compositions handle the flow of data across its life cycle
   and present it as information to the initiating system. The proposal
   starts by creating a graph model of the Arrowhead framework. Then,
   building on the graph model, the query-based approach for specifying,
   validating, and forming the SoS is proposed. The proposed graph model
   allows for unambiguous description of systems and their interrelations,
   including security relations. The proposed composer operates on the edge
   computing hardware and gives the production floor the ability to extract
   information without impacting the overall operation of the factory.},

Abstract = {The paper provides background information, extensions and applications
   of the `BIM Cube' framework that is defined with three axes: (1)
   lifecycle, (2) standardization and (3) interoperability, which are
   related to the practical use and research in building information
   modelling (BIM). A brief review of related frameworks is given along
   with BIM Cube's seven requirements for the methodology for the research
   in BIM and the need to introduce the concept of standpoints. A detailed
   explanation is provided how the framework was developed and how a
   `Systems-Thinking' can further extend the framework with a
   Systems-of-Systems approach. Finally, we show how the framework can be
   used to investigate current practices and R\&D issues, identify gaps,
   and streamline research and practical applications in BIM practices,
   technologies and policies.},

Abstract = {The UK govermnent's mandate of BIM Level Two since April 2016 in the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry meant that
   companies need clear standards and a road map for BIM implementation,
   especially in terms of standards. Now the UK government is looking to
   start implementing BIM Level Three, which is mentioned in the Government
   Construction Strategy 2016-2020, March 2016. Therefore, the AEC industry
   needs clearer standards to go further than BIM Level Two and to start
   the implementation of BIM Level Three. In infrastructure and civil
   works, where the gap between the industry and BIM is wider than in the
   building environment, having clear standards covered by direct road maps
   and platforms is essential. This paper challenges the fitness for
   purpose of the current specification and standards for infrastructure
   areas and civil works. It will be argued that the transfer of
   information and processes between site works and building, in general,
   is not yet clear, which might complicate the implementation process; in
   the sense that to facilitate the implementation process in
   infrastructure projects, the standards might be included in the file
   data properties which could help all stakeholders to work in various
   level of detail (LOD) specifications. This paper will be considered as a
   contributed paper, mainly built on a comprehensive review for LOD
   standards for sites, land development, civil works and file-format
   concepts under the specific guidance for the information management
   requirements associated with projects delivered using PAS 1192-2; the
   paper will also be shared in some of the management and technical
   interviews with project managers and BIM coordinators from the Gulf
   regain project's experiences as part of the primary data. To be more
   practical, the paper will share a prototype of land development project
   developed in Muller Road, Bristol, UK, to be introduced using a visual
   information chart, showing the file format for the land development
   project's information life cycle in detail, concept design projects and
   the capability of current BIM platforms to help engineers to go further.},

Abstract = {This work presents a method for retrieving 3D building contours usable
   in facade retrofitting projects, which uses a parametric modeling
   workflow that utilizes a point-cloud slicing method to retrieve such 3D
   contours. Since current commitments by European governments seek to
   reduce energy consumption as a means to reduce carbon emissions from
   building stock by 2050, facade retrofitting appears as an alternative
   for addressing operational and embedded building emissions. Within such
   a context, the main contribution of this work consists of a workflow and
   a 3D reconstruction solution that uses a parametric environment for
   capturing building topology and bypassing ground-level occlusions. A
   real case study and a strategy for converting 3D building contours into
   Industry Foundation Classes entities, directly from the parametric
   modeling environment, served as a scenario for testing the capabilities
   of a Grasshopper solution and open new perspectives for this approach.},

Abstract = {The IEA EBC Annex 72 focuses on the assessment of the primary energy
   demand, greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of buildings
   during production, construction, use (including repair and replacement)
   and end of life (dismantling), i.e. during the entire life cycle of
   buildings. In one of its activities, reference buildings (size,
   materialisation, operational energy demand, etc.) were defined on which
   the existing national assessment methods are applied using national (if
   available) databases and (national/regional) approaches. The
   ``be2226{''} office building in Lustenau, Austria was selected as one of
   the reference buildings. TU Graz established a BIM model and quantified
   the amount of building elements as well as construction materials
   required and the operational energy demand. The building assessment was
   carried out using the same material and energy demand but applying the
   LCA approach used in the different countries represented by the
   participating Annex experts. The results of these assessments are
   compared in view of identifying major discrepancies. Preliminary
   findings show that the greenhouse gas emissions per kg of building
   material differ up to a factor of two and more. Major differences in the
   building assessments are observed in the transports to the construction
   site (imports) and the construction activities as well as in the
   greenhouse gas emissions of the operational energy demand (electricity).
   The experts document their practical difficulties and how they overcame
   them. The results of this activity are used to better target
   harmonisation efforts.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This research paper is a literature review of the existing
   building retrofitting process. It proposes studying the functional,
   technical, and organizational issues of the green retrofit process. The
   purpose of this paper is to expand the domain of design framework for
   retrofitting existing buildings.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the
   model-based design process from enrollment to evaluation stages
   representing the green retrofitting process in selected publications.
   The paper opted to review the Green Retrofit Design (GRD) process model
   for achieving a systematic design model of GRD development in the
   future.
   Findings - Functional and maintenance issues are mainly for new
   buildings, also in the field for renovation and demolishing.
   Publications also show that environmental, social, and technical issues
   are often examined separately in the decision process of GRD. Papers in
   the facility management scale would concentratemore on
   organization/legal issues. Publications with questionnaire design are
   devoted to the usage on life-cycle assessment on existing building, but
   not yet on the stakeholder management and design process and related
   issues.
   Social implications - The achievement of the study is to provide a new
   framework of design approach that is significant to the theoretical
   research, education, communication, and practical works in terms of GRD
   development.
   Originality/value - The paper not only achieves a specific sequence of
   practical approaches, including awareness of problems, conceptual
   development, and design embodiment, to meet design objectives, but also
   conforms to academic practice-based research of creative design taking
   on GRD practice.},

Title = {ADO: A disease ontology representing the domain knowledge specific to
   Alzheimer's disease},

Abstract = {Background: Biomedical ontologies offer the capability to structure and
   represent domain-specific knowledge semantically. Disease-specific
   ontologies can facilitate knowledge exchange across multiple
   disciplines, and ontology-driven mining approaches can generate great
   value for modeling disease mechanisms. However, in the case of
   neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a lack
   of formal representation of the relevant knowledge domain.
   Methods: Alzheimer's disease ontology (ADO) is constructed in accordance
   to the ontology building life cycle. The Prot g OWL editor was used as a
   tool for building ADO in Ontology Web Language format.
   Results; ADO was developed with the purpose of containing information
   relevant to four main biological views preclinical, clinical,
   etiological, and molecular/cellular mechanisms and was enriched by
   adding synonyms and references. Validation of the lexicalized ontology
   by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed a satisfactory
   performance (F score = 72\%). In addition to structural and functional
   evaluation, a clinical expert in the field performed a manual evaluation
   and curation of ADO. Through integration of ADO into an information
   retrieval environment, we show that the ontology supports semantic
   search in scientific text. The usefulness of ADO is authenticated by
   dedicated use case scenarios.
   Conclusions: Development of ADO as an open ADO is a first attempt to
   organize information related to Alzheimer's disease in a formalized,
   structured manner. We demonstrate that ADO is able to capture both
   established and scattered knowledge existing in scientific text. (C)

Title = {Applying Building Information Modelling (BIM) Technology in Pre-Tender
   Cost Estimation of Construction Projects: A Case Study in Iran},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The pre-tender cost estimation serves as the foundation for determining
   the project cost in the early stages and is crucial for all parties
   involved in the tendering process. It is expected to be highly accurate.
   However, industry surveys have advocated that in the Iranian
   construction industry, the pre-tender estimated costs of construction
   projects are not sufficiently accurate during the bidding stage.
   Building information modelling (BIM) technology is a modern digital tool
   deployed in the construction industry that has seen substantial growth
   of application. It employs useful tools in different sectors and has
   extended its involvement in various stages of the project lifecycle,
   including feasibility studies, planning, design, construction, and
   operation and maintenance. This study examines and assesses the status
   of BIM development in Iran for its applicability in the pre-tender cost
   estimating process in construction projects. The findings of this study
   indicate that while there is a limited number of Iranian building
   projects' BIM models that possess the required quality and capabilities
   for BIM-based cost estimation, the results obtained are more precise
   when compared to existing manual methods. Additionally, utilising
   BIM-based cost estimation significantly reduces the time required for
   this process by enhancing the speed of cost estimation operations. An
   innovative evaluation framework for assessing the quality and
   functionalities of BIM models is presented, which improves the accuracy
   of cost estimation before the bidding process in Iran's construction
   industry. The research findings demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and
   effectiveness of BIM as compared to conventional approaches. It also
   suggests the incorporation of AI technology for model evaluation, which
   has the potential to become an established global industry standard.},

Title = {Generative HBIM modelling to embody complexity (LOD, LOG, LOA, LOI):
   surveying, preservation, site interventionthe Basilica diCollemaggio
   (L'Aquila)},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {545-567},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In December 2012, EniServizi (the Italian multinational energy company),
   after the Earthquake that occurred at L'Aquila in April 2009, decided to
   undertake the project Re-start from Collemaggio, funding around 14
   million Euro to restore the Basilica di Collemaggio. EniServizi, aware
   of the BIM potential role in the complex building and infrastructure
   domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM based on laser scanner
   and photogrammetric surveying to address decision-making processes among
   the different actors involved in the preservation process. The Basilica
   of Collemaggio has been re-opened to the public on December 2017. This
   paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in
   relation to both positive and critical aspects relating HBIM
   feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging
   restoration and preservation field. The theoretical and practical HBIM
   approach here tackled overcomes the current BIM logic based on the
   sequential process adopted by the AIA and NBS Level of Development
   (LOD), characterized by a simple-to-complex-detailing process, working
   in the new construction domain and generally following the
   conceptualizing phase, the preliminary design, the executive design, the
   construction phase till to the facility management. A complex-mixed LOD
   approach, able to entail the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each
   component and to get the maximum degree of knowledge, has been
   experimented in order to derive informed decisions in terms of
   preservation, restoration and management since the starting phases of
   the architectural design. To this aim, a Level of Geometry (LOG)
   coherent to the Level of Accuracy gained by the high-resolution surveys
   has been adapted to the specificity of the restoration process of a
   historic monument and is here proposed through different Grade of
   Generation (GOG) protocols developed in the object modelling to support
   the preliminary and definitive design proposal of the conservation plan
   of the Basilica. Particularly, a NURBS-based parametric generative
   modelling process (GOG9-10) is here proposed in order to get models BIM
   abled to describe the complex geometry and to match the related
   information. Specific Level of Information (LOI) has been introduced to
   support the preservation process, to document the as-built and the
   management of the building after the intervention, moving HBIM toward
   multi-actor domain. Given the effort required by such approach,
   obtaining a cost-effective HBIM modelling embodying the complexity of
   each damaged element as acquired by the surveys (i.e. walls, pillars,
   vaults, beams) represents a challenging issue. The result of the overall
   process aims to contribute in lowering the initial HBIM modelling costs
   by deploying a sustainable complexity delivering protocols and
   specification and by boosting at the same time an interoperable
   cooperative HBIM habit among multi-actors across all the phases,
   spreading its usability after the restoration process. On the lesson
   learnt, the process of updating the current Codification criteria
   (UNI11337-2009) has been started with a draft proposal stimulating the
   debate for the future of HBIM adoption in the case of restoration,
   preservation and maintenance (UNI11337-2017): in the conviction that
   transferring the HBIM richness into the Life Cycle Management process
   will allow multi-actors to take in account the knowledge and information
   gained during the restoration, integrating the as-built updating and
   keeping updated the monument monitoring during the time being.},

Abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is the main building block of many
   deep learning models which are now becoming one of the most important
   kind of algorithms in machine leaning community. With the growing demand
   for information processing in aerospace computer, RBM can be used as a
   promising block supporting intelligent applications such as space
   self-control, intelligent recognition, and target classification. As for
   aerospace computer, a common challenge is the Single Event Upset (SEU)
   effect, which would change the state of some information bits
   stochastically and lead to error results. Due to the time-consuming and
   data-intensive computation of aerospace computer, digital signal
   processing (DSP) is the most suitable for aerospace computation. In this
   paper, we first implement representative RBM learning algorithm in a
   power efficient DSP platform. Then, we explore the possible SEU effects
   in our hardware architecture and RBM learning algorithm. Further, we
   integrate three software fault detection techniques (i.e. duplication,
   increasing data diversity, shortening life cycle of variable) into RBM
   learning. In the experiment, we utilize the simulated fault injection
   technique to evaluate fault detective RBM learning. The evaluation shows
   that our fault detection designs effectively detect SEU-induced error
   during RBM learning in DSP with low computational complexity.},

Abstract = {AECO is struggling with data loss, inefficient processes and low
   productivity in asset management. The remedy to these problems seems to
   be the idea of Digital Twin (DT). However, the frameworks proposed so
   far do not always support a solution to these problems. This paper
   conducts an extensive literature review to develop a conceptual
   framework for the Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase for building
   facilities. The conceptual framework takes into account the increasingly
   popular Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   technologies. The foundation, however, is Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) technology. The presented framework, after appropriate
   modifications, can also be applied to infrastructure facilities or city
   fragments. The paper presents limitations and directions for further
   research. The DT paradigm has been adopted and its adoption is ongoing.
   Its implementation will progress in the coming years. The advantages and
   benefits are certainly more numerous than the barriers and risks posed
   by the use of DT.},

Title = {A data model for integrating BIM and blockchain to enable a single

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},

Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Purpose Despite a large amount of BIM data at the handover stage, it is
   still difficult to identify and effectively isolate valuable
   construction supply chain (CSC) data that need to be reliably handed
   over for operation. Moreover, the role of reconciling disparate data is
   usually played by one party. The integration of blockchain and BIM is a
   plausible framework for building a reliable digital asset lifecycle.
   This paper proposes a BIM single source of truth (BIMSSoT) data model
   using blockchain for ensuring a reliable CSC data delivery.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper utilises a blended methodology,
   the foundation of which is ingrained in business and management research
   with elements of information and communication technology (ICT) research
   wherever required. Knowledge elicitation case studies utilising novel
   interventions such as a data flow diagram (DFD), taxonomy and
   entity-relationship diagram (ERD) were used in this paper to develop the
   BIMSSoT data model. The model was validated using an expert forum, and
   its technological feasibility was established by developing a proof of
   concept. Findings The practical contribution of this research leads to
   the progression of BIM towards digital engineering to go beyond
   object-based 3D modelling by building structured and reliable datasets,
   transitioning from project-centric records to a digital ecosystem of
   linked databases by utilizing blockchain's potential for ensuring
   trusted data. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge,
   prior to this paper, no research had investigated a detailed data model
   development leveraging blockchain and BIM to integrate an immutable and
   complete record of CSC data as another dimension of BIM for operations.},

Title = {Thermal Comfort in the Built Environment: A Digital Workflow for the
   Comparison of Different Green Infrastructure Strategies},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {The green transformation of the built environment is aimed at improving
   sustainability and can be supported by digitalization, which has become
   a significant tool to support the supply, integration, and management of
   information throughout the construction life cycle. In addition, climate
   change highly affects human comfort in the built environment and
   different strategies should be evaluated for adapting cities. This paper
   developed a digital workflow by integrating existing tools (i.e.,
   Grasshopper, Ladybug, Honeybee, and Dragonfly) to evaluate how different
   green infrastructure strategies affected the thermal comfort by reducing
   the UTCI. The workflow was applied to a typical historical urban context
   (Catania, South of Italy), consisting of a square surrounded by
   three-floor buildings. Three basic scenarios were created that depended
   on the pavement material used in the built environment: a black stone
   pavement (reference material from Mount Etna), a permeable pavement, and
   grass. These three scenarios were combined with different green
   infrastructure strategies: tree pattern on the square, green walls and
   green roofs on the surrounding buildings, and the integrations of all
   these above-mentioned strategies. The results demonstrated that the
   integration of different green strategies (a grass square instead of
   pavement, with trees, and green walls and green roofs) increased the
   thermal comfort by reducing the UTCI by more than 8 degrees C compared
   to the existing urban context (black stone pavement and building
   envelope). However, this temperature reduction was highly affected by
   the location of the human body into the urban context and by the
   evaporation rates from vegetation. The workflow developed will be useful
   for designers to evaluate the effectiveness of different green
   strategies during the early-design stage in mitigating and adapting
   cities to climate change.},

Title = {Factors affecting the number of building defects and the approaches to
   reduce their negative impacts in Malaysian public universities'
   buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-171},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Purpose The largest share of a building maintenance budget goes towards
   preventing or repairing building defects. Also, building defects shorten
   a building's lifetime, impact the user's safety and health, prevent the
   buildings from performing their functions well and repairing building
   defects generates waste. Therefore, this study aims to specify the
   factors that affecting the number of building defects and how to reduce
   their negative impacts. Design/methodology/approach A case study was
   used as a research strategy and convergent parallel mixed methods were
   used as research design. Quantitative and qualitative data were
   collected concurrently, followed by independent analyses of the
   quantitative and qualitative data, and then merged the two sets of
   results according to the procedure of using the convergent parallel
   design. Descriptive statistics analysed quantitative data, whilst
   qualitative data was analysed by the content analysis technique.
   Findings The findings of this study explored the factors that affect the
   number of defects in buildings, the significant factors were related to
   the building's life cycle in terms of design, construction, operation
   and maintenance phase; relevant attributes were construction teams,
   building users and maintenance teams. The study also addressed the
   approaches to minimise the negative impacts of those factors. Their
   negative impacts mainly contributed to increased building defects that
   increase maintenance costs, affect users' safety and health, reduce
   buildings' lifespan and cause environmental impact due to resource
   extraction. Originality/value The existing studies have not adequately
   addressed the significant factors that affect the number of building
   defects. Also, emerging technologies and environmental sustainability
   considerations related to building defects have not been linked in
   previous related work. Therefore, the present study has contributed to
   filling this gap.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {10, SI},
Pages = {1339-1354},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a solid understanding of
   how integrated building information modeling (BIM) is implemented in a
   mega project such as the (Istanbul Grand Airport IGA) construction
   project, which is the main case study in the research methodology.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper examines and identifies the lean
   efficiency gains achieved in the IGA project and highlights the
   synergies between BIM and lean concepts based on the facts and figures
   from the case study analysis. In complex projects, there is a vital need
   for a comprehensive approach that would enable successful managing of
   design and construction information via accurate modeling, collaboration
   and integration throughout the project lifecycles covering various
   disciplines.
   Findings The research findings in the paper make a significant impact in
   understanding the strategic perception for BIM as a new way of working
   methodology for the construction industry in Turkey, since the IGA
   project has become not only a key learning hub for the Turkish
   construction industry, but also a global landmark for digital
   construction and project delivery. In addition it proves the mutual
   synergies between BIM and lean practices.
   Originality/value The IGA project is a mega-scale airport construction
   project with features beyond building industry challenges, and it should
   be designed and constructed with tight deadlines and budgets and be
   operated afterwards in an effective and efficient way. Can lean and BIM
   help for timely and on-budget completion of the project and could they
   support the management of the airport facility after handover? The paper
   also discusses the lean and BIM implementation in the project in
   relation to the BIM Level 3 requirements.},

Title = {Comparative Study of BIM Acceptance between Korea and the United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {142},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Substantial research has been performed on data standards and exchanges
   in the AEC/FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facilities
   Management) industry over the past several years. The growing popularity
   of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily on
   the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of
   information during a project's lifecycle. Although many researchers and
   practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and
   benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted,
   and what factors enhance the implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance
   and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. BIM was
   accepted in the United States earlier than in Korea, and BIM users are
   expected to have a higher maturity and positive perception about
   utilizing BIM depending on a lengthier utilization period. This means
   that the mechanism for achieving acceptance of BIM in Korea differs from
   the mechanism in the United States. Therefore, Korea's BIM acceptance
   model was compared to that in the United States using structural
   equation modeling. The key components, including the BIM acceptance
   model, were identified through a literature review of the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) and related theories and was consolidated by
   interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction
   industry. Based on these components, a questionnaire was designed and
   sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors,
   architects, construction managers, engineers, and facility managers) in
   Korea and the United States. A total 164 completed questionnaires were
   retrieved. Structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing was
   conducted using commercially-available software. The results from this
   study can serve as a foundation for research looking into the
   organizational context to further BIM acceptance in the construction
   industry. The comparison of the mechanism and subsequent results will
   serve as a guideline for developing an acceptance strategy that is
   suitable for Korea. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become one of the most
   recognized technologies for the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industry in recent years. It brings an innovative
   revolution for the industry to substitute traditional two-dimensional
   (2D) drawings by using digital three-dimensional (3D) modelling. This is
   definitely a significant progress to the building design phase, which is
   the initial and crucial stage of a construction project lifecycle.
   Currently, most Chinese AEC firms are still using a conventional
   building design process that has some serious issues including lack of
   communication, technological constraint and complex system. These issues
   can result in lots of design mistakes and mismatches, which will lead to
   a series of consequences such as resource waste, cost increase, schedule
   delay and lots of rework. Therefore, BIM provides a satisfying solution
   with its powerful software support and modem concept. It not only can
   help China's AEC firms to implement design visualization and
   synchronization, but also can promote multi-disciplinary coordination.
   This paper aims to review the current situation of China's BIM and its
   application in the project design phase, and then use a scientific
   research methodology to explore a BIM-based design coordination
   framework for China's AEC industry in the future.},

Title = {Barriers to Building Information Modeling (BIM) Deployment in Small
   Construction Projects: Malaysian Construction Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) application in construction projects
   is considered beneficial for effective decision making throughout the
   project lifecycle, as it maximizes benefits without compromising
   practicality. The Malaysian construction industry is also keen on the
   adoption of BIM culture. However, various identified and unidentified
   barriers are hindering its practical implementation. In light of this,
   this study identified and analyzed critical obstacles to using BIM in
   Malaysian small construction projects. Through the use of
   semi-structured interviews and a pilot study using the exploratory
   factor analysis (EFA) method, the critical BIM barriers (CBBs) have been
   identified. Based on the findings of the EFA, CBBs were classified into
   five categories, i.e., technical adoption barrier, behavioral barrier,
   implementation barrier, management barrier, and digital education
   barrier. Following the questionnaire survey, feedback of 235
   professionals was collected with vested interests in the Malaysian
   construction business, and the CBBs model was created using analysis of
   moment structures (AMOS). The findings revealed that although Malaysian
   experts with little experience in practice were fairly educated about
   BIM, technical adoption barriers, behavioral barriers, management
   barriers, and implementation hurdles were critical for adopting BIM. The
   study's findings will help policymakers eliminate CBBs and use BIM in
   Malaysia's modest construction projects to save costs, save time, boost
   productivity, and improve quality and sustainability.},

Abstract = {According to the Global Status report for Buildings and Construction,
   the building and construction sector accounts for 36\% of global energy
   consumption and 39\% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
   Specifically, the construction site represents one of the most
   significant sources of environmental impact, making it a pivotal element
   in achieving sustainability within the construction industry. The
   construction process and maintenance activities on buildings are,
   therefore, critical phases in which the construction industry is tasked
   with finding a balance between economic development, social well-being,
   and environmental protection to ensure a sustainable future for both
   current and future generations. To promote a construction model focused
   on environmental, economic, and social sustainability, this paper
   introduces a Performance Protocol. This protocol serves as an
   operational tool that allows both the construction company and the
   contracting authority to manage these aspects throughout the entire
   construction process. Digital technologies such as BIM and Digital Twin
   can take advantage of such model to integrate and develop sustainability
   analysis and simulation during the entire life cycle of a building. The
   use of digital tools is one of the challenges for the future of the
   built environment that needs to address not only the issues related to
   costs and management but also considering the social and environmental
   aspects of sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Prefabricated construction has been used for public rental housing in
   Hong Kong. In order to speed up housing delivery, Hong Kong Housing
   Authority (HKHA) have employed advanced technologies, including Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),
   in some of their pilot prefabrication-based construction projects.
   However, the information obtained from BIM and RFID is not well
   connected and shared among relevant stakeholders. This paper introduces
   a multi-dimensional Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled BIM platform
   (MITBIMP) to achieve real-time visibility and traceability in
   prefabricated construction. Design considerations of a RFID Gateway
   Operating System, visibility and traceability tools, Data Source
   Interoperability Services, and decision support services are specified
   for developing the MITBIMP. A case study from a real-life construction
   project in Hong Kong is used as a pilot project to demonstrate advanced
   decision-making by using cutting-edge concepts and technologies within
   the MITBIMP to providing a basis for real-time visibility and
   traceability of the whole processes of prefabrication-based
   construction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Smart Facility Management System Based on Open BIM and Augmented Reality
   Technology},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the construction
   industry is also witnessing the application of numerous state-of-the-art
   technologies. Among these, augmented reality (AR) technology has the
   advantage of utilizing existing 3D models and BIM data and is thus an
   area of active research. However, the main area of research to date has
   either been in visualizing information during the design phase, where
   architects and project stakeholders can share viewings, or in confirming
   the required information for construction management through
   visualization during the construction phase. As such, more research is
   required in the application of AR during the facility management (FM)
   phase. Research utilizing BIM in the FM phase, which constitutes the
   longest period during the lifecycle of a building, has been continuously
   carried out but has faced challenges with regard to on-site application.
   The reason for this is that information required for BIM during the
   design, construction and FM phases is different, and the reproduced
   information is vast, so identifying the required BIM data for FM and
   interfacing with other systems is difficult. As a measure to overcome
   this limitation, advanced countries such as the US and UK have developed
   and are using Construction Operations Building information exchange
   (COBie), which is an open-source BIM-based information exchange system.
   In order to effectively convert open-source BIM data to AR data, this
   research defined COBie data for windows and doors, converted them to a
   system and validated that it could actually be applied for on-site FM.
   The results of this system's creation and validation showed that the
   proposed AR-based smart FMS demonstrated faster and easier access to
   information compared with existing 2D blueprint-based FM work, while
   information obtained through AR allowed for immediate, more visual and
   easier means to express the information when integrated with actual
   objects.},

Title = {BIM-centered high-speed railway line design for full infrastructure
   lifecycle},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the field of civil engineering, specifically within railway projects,
   the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become
   imperative. However, the sector's adherence to traditional methods for
   infrastructure design and management has delayed the widespread adoption
   of BIM. This paper describes a BIMcentered methodology applied to a
   real-world High-Speed Railway Line (HSRL) project. Through an extensive
   examination of HSRL design parameters and the integration of various
   BIM-based tools, a 3D parametric design model is generated. This model
   serves as the foundation for evaluating up to five design alternatives,
   considering technical and economic aspects. Furthermore, a degradation
   model is proposed to assess alternative performance over the
   infrastructure's full lifecycle under specific rail traffic assumptions.
   This facilitates a rapid evaluation of alignment design's impact on
   maintenance costs. The paper draws two main conclusions with potential
   benefits for both private companies and railway administrations:
   Firstly, BIM proves feasible and advantageous despite some
   interoperability challenges, highlighting the need for continued
   advancements in BIM software compatibility. Secondly, the proposed
   approach can potentially lead to up to 40\% cost savings in maintenance
   for railway administrations.},

Abstract = {In this research, sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate the
   impact from U-values of walls, U-value of windows, and the
   window-to-wall ratio. The purpose is to find the co-relationship between
   those parameters with the building energy performance, including
   embedded energy in materials and operational energy during the
   lifecycle. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used as a platform to
   obtain the material quantities and carry on energy simulation. A case
   study is applied for a manufactory plant in Suzhou, China. By applying
   both local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis, it is
   found that thermal properties of walls have insignificant impact on
   Operational Energy to Embodied Energy (OE-EE) relationship of
   Window-Wall-Ratio (WWR) whereas changing thermal properties of windows
   affects the OE-EE relationship behaviour of WWR. Lowering U-value of
   windows brings positive impact to the OE-EE relationship of WWR, and
   vice versa. Therefore, suggestions are made as reducing/increasing
   U-value of windows while increasing/decreasing the WWR of building.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers the possibility to access
   and oversee information about the asset, throughout its lifecycle. One
   of the phases where BIM can provide key benefits is the Operation phase,
   e.g. facility management/maintenance, decommissioning and major
   re-programming, supported by the Information Management Process (IMP),
   which may include a Computer-Managed Maintenance System (CMMS). When
   discussing roads, highways or runways the maintenance phase is largely
   concentrated on the pavement, and a robust Pavement Management System
   (PMS) should be integral part of the IMP, focusing mainly on the
   evaluation of the pavement's present condition and prediction of its
   future condition. In the airport domain, the importance of an Airport
   Pavement Management System (APMS), falls both in a cost effectiveness
   and aviation safety viewpoint, providing consistent, objective and
   systematic procedures for determining priorities, schedules and
   resources' assignment. Introducing the case study of the Lamezia Terme
   International Airport, this paper presents possible improvements in the
   interoperability of maintenance data of the airport's runway with
   reference to the IFC Reference Processes, being that Maintenance
   Management is one of the defined projects within the Facilities
   Management (FM) domain inside BuildingSMART International.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {The process of designing a building involves producing design concepts
   while fulfilling various requirements and regulations. Furthermore,
   during the project's life-cycle, multiple experts from multiple domains
   collaborate in developing the different partial models, including
   architectural, structural, and HVAC among others. Accordingly, clearly
   communicating the rationale behind design decisions is crucial for
   developing regulatory compliant designs that also fit the owner's needs.
   The developed designs are the main deliverables exchanged and handed
   over. However, these deliverables do not include any explanation of
   design intentions or documentation of design decisions. Communication
   among parties and reuse of knowledge are hindered by the absent
   explanation of existing design. To overcome this deficiency, this paper
   proposes a methodology for digitally documenting design decisions,
   incorporating their intention and rationale. Architectural concepts and
   evaluation criteria are represented in the form of explanation tags as
   well as spatial and semantic constraints, which are assigned to the
   individual model elements and properties. Additionally, to document how
   design decisions fulfill owner requirements and regulatory documents,
   natural language processing (NLP) is employed to facilitate querying
   those documents and then the individual requirements are linked to
   specific elements, properties, and constraints. To evaluate the proposed
   methodology, a prototype was implemented as a plugin inside a
   BIM-Authoring tool and multiple real-world use cases are discussed.},

Abstract = {Software Engineering (SE) contracts play a pivotal role in Information
   Technology Outsourcing (ITO) projects. The obligations in SE contracts
   are known to be a useful source for deriving software requirements,
   thereby contributing to the overall Software Development Life Cycle
   (SDLC). Making sense of contractual obligations is an important first
   step in successfully executing software projects. This includes building
   compliant systems, meeting delivery deadlines, avoiding heavy penalties,
   and steering clear of expensive litigations. In this work, we present an
   approach to capture the essence of a contractual clause by extracting
   its Contracts Grammar. Through an exploratory study, we first identify
   the constituents of Contracts Grammar. Subsequently, we experiment with
   multiple approaches for the automated extraction of these constituents,
   including extractive question-answering, token classification,
   text-to-text generation, prompting, and regular expressions. The
   question-answering based approach performed the best in terms of high
   average ROUGE-L score of 0.81, and faster inference times. The work
   presented in this paper is a part of the Contracts Governance System
   (CGS) and is in the process of deployment within a large IT vendor
   organization.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, Qatar started an industry diversification
   strategy based on a knowledge-based economy for the next years. The
   ambition is to become a global ``hub{''} in some key fields such as new
   technologies, finance, culture and sporting events. Such a
   diversification strategy requires massive investments, not only in
   physical and technical infrastructures, but also in the field of
   education. For instance, big projects based on the use of advanced new
   technologies such as BIM (Building Information Modelling) are currently
   under development in new economic cluster areas in the country, such as
   QEZ (Qatar Economic Zones), Lusail Smart City, Stadiums for FIFA world
   cup 2022, etc. This raises a need for new BIM competences, and helps
   local education institutions such Qatar University to adopt a BIM
   education strategy in collaboration with these sectors and AEC
   (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry in general. Such
   effort intends to cover the lack of skills and equips graduates with
   specific BIM competency. Globally, BIM education in the country remains
   soft and partial compared to the current evolution of the AEC industry
   but also to the risks that are inherent to the BIM adoption. This paper
   deals with the integration of new information technology patterns such
   as Cybersecurity and its Blockchains feature in a typical university BIM
   curricula. Addressing this feature during the BIM collaborative
   processes, such as the sharing information models developed and
   maintained across the lifecycle of the building/infrastructure, is
   becoming tremendous. Such curricula are becoming multidisciplinary by
   nature, and require the collaboration between not only the different
   education departments (Architecture, Civil Engineering, Computer Science
   and Engineering ... ), but also the local concerned industry. An
   integrated proposal will be made in this paper, focusing on the specific
   needs of the Qatari context.},

Abstract = {Current bridge inspection practices are typically predicated upon manual
   paper-based data collection methods, which significantly limit the
   ability to transfer knowledge gained throughout the lifecycle of the
   asset, to benefit the assessment of the inspector or engineer. This
   study aims to overcome the limitations of current practices and proposes
   a conceptual framework to improve the reliability and efficiency of
   current bridge asset management practices through the integration of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced computing and imaging
   technologies. As a tool for bridge inspections, BIM offers significant
   potential when integrated with laser scanning and keypoint-based texture
   recognition, which allows for the detection of such defects as cracking,
   corrosion or settlement in bridge components. In recent years, the
   construction industry has seen an increased use of BIM technology
   on-site to aid the construction process. However, the applications of it
   are deficient through the asset management phases of a project. Given
   the ability of BIM to house all component specific information gathered
   from the construction, inspection and maintenance phases, BIM is
   envisioned to allow emphasis to be placed on retrieving the relevant
   information throughout the project lifecycle, ultimately enabling
   engineers and bridge inspectors to make more informed decisions about
   the current condition of the structure. Using BIM as the focal point for
   information collection throughout the project lifecycle, findings from
   advanced imaging and data processing are proposed to be stored within
   the model for recall at future bridge assessments.},

Title = {Prediction of Highway Tunnel Pavement Performance Based on Digital Twin
   and Multiple Time Series Stacking},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {The existing pavement performance prediction methods are limited to
   single-factor predictions, which often face the challenges of high cost,
   low efficiency, and poor accuracy. It is difficult to simultaneously
   solve the temporal, spatial, and exogenous dependencies between pavement
   performance data and maintenance, the service life of highways, the
   environment, and other factors. Digital twin technology based on the
   building information modeling (BIM) model, combined with machine
   learning, puts forward a new perspective and method for the accurate and
   timely prediction of pavement performance. In this paper, we propose a
   highway tunnel pavement performance prediction approach based on a
   digital twin and multiple time series stacking (MTSS). This paper (1)
   establishes an MTSS prediction model with heterogeneous stacking of
   eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the artificial neural network
   (ANN), random forest (RF), ridge regression, and support vector
   regression (SVR) component learners after exploratory data analysis
   (EDA); (2) proposes a method based on multiple time series feature
   extraction to accurately predict the pavement performance change trend,
   using the highway segment as the minimum computing unit and considering
   multiple factors; (3) uses grid search with the k-fold cross validation
   method to optimize hyperparameters to ensure the robustness, stability,
   and generalization ability of the prediction model; and (4) constructs a
   digital twin for pavement performance prediction to realize the
   real-time dynamic evolution of prediction. The method proposed in this
   study is applied in the life cycle management of the Dalian
   highway-crossing tunnel in Shanghai, China. A dataset covering 2010-2019
   is collected for real-time prediction of the pavement performance. The
   prediction accuracy evaluation shows that the mean absolute error (MAE)
   is 0.1314, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.0386, the mean
   absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 5.10\%, and the accuracy is 94.90\%.
   Its overall performance is better than a single model. The results
   verify that the prediction method based on digital twin and MTSS is
   feasible and effective in the highway tunnel pavement performance
   prediction.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is known as a tool for collaboration
   among construction organisations in generating and managing data across
   the construction lifecycle. Despite from the advantages of engaged from
   BIM (i.e; reduce the number of clashes within the construction process,
   improve the building visualization, and shorten the planning period),
   most of the contractor's organisations are still hesitant to deploy the
   technology. The aim of this paper is to comprehend the challenges in
   adopting BIM across project phases. A semi-structured interview was
   conducted through eight respondents from contractor's organisations
   which adopt BIM. The interview data were recorded and analysed using
   ATLAS.ti software. As a result, the finding demonstrated eight (8)
   substantial challenges in adopting BIM including staff resistance,
   selection of software and hardware, lack of knowledge an information of
   BIM, lack of data of return on investment of BIM, implementation cost
   and benefits, lack of demands from the clients, lack of supply chain
   buy-in, and lack of standards-policy makers. Meanwhile, another ten (10)
   challenges for instance training and education, culture change,
   ownership and intellectual property, contractual agreement,
   authenticity, product liabilities risks, legal uncertainties and
   affection to the business environment are remarked as least challenges
   revealed by the participants. In spite, two (2) additional challenges
   which are not mentioned by the previous researchers were disclosed by
   the participants which are trustworthiness and organisation's politic.
   On this balance, all the challenges grouped into six major elements;
   people, software and hardware, cost, product, standard, and others.
   Thus, it is expected that the finding shall bring significant and
   knowledge for the construction practices to understand the challenges in
   adopting BIM across construction projects.},

Abstract = {The current demolition practice requires enhancement to align with the
   principles of a circular economy. This can be accomplished by
   incorporating digital technologies, with BIM as the most favourable
   option for representing data on built assets. Challenges arise,
   particularly at the end of an asset's lifecycle, due to the absence of
   BIM models and limited interoperability. This paper presents a framework
   for demolition preparation based on asset digital representation,
   providing a concrete example of generating information requirements for
   a BIM model of a building to be demolished while ensuring
   interoperability throughout the process. It results in a specification
   of recyclable or reusable materials and products that can be integrated
   with online marketplaces, encouraging circular practices. Grounded in
   existing technological capabilities and international standards, the
   demonstrated framework allows immediate technological implementation and
   offers open and accessible application development, ensuring a low entry
   threshold for businesses.},

Abstract = {Sustainability assessment (SA) has been one of the prime contributors to
   advanced manufacturing analysis, and it traditionally involves life
   cycle assessment (LCA) techniques for retrospective and prospective
   evaluations. One big challenge to reach a reliable sustainability
   assessment comes from the inadequate understandings of the underlying
   activities related to each of the product lifecycle stages based on
   expert knowledge. Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, is an
   emerging approach that takes advantage of machine-learning methods in
   building models that would complement or replace the knowledge-based
   models capturing physical behaviors. Incorporating suitable data
   analytics models to utilize real-time product and process data could
   significantly improve LCA techniques.
   To address the complexity and uncertainty involved in multilevel SA
   decision-making activities, this paper proposes a modular LCA framework
   to accommodate a hybrid modeling paradigm that includes knowledge-based
   and data-driven models. We identify and emphasize on two important
   challenges: (1) Generalizing knowledge-based and data-driven models into
   analytics models so that they can be uniformly deployed and
   interchanged, and (2) Modularizing the LCA decision logics and model
   structures so that the LCA decision process can be streamlined and
   easily maintained. The issues related to the decomposition,
   standardization, deployment and execution of analytics models are
   discussed in this paper. Three well-adopted standards -STEP (Standard
   for the Exchange of Product model data), DMN (Decision Model and
   Notation), and PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) are employed to
   capture the product-related data/information, the decision logic
   decomposition of analytics models, and the structure decomposition of
   analytics models, respectively.
   The feasibility and benefits of the proposed modular, hybrid
   sustainability assessment methodology have been illustrated with an
   injection molding case study, incorporating an overall modular
   Scorecard-based LCA architecture with a Bayesian Network predictive
   model.},

Title = {Development of a framework to track life safety levels of occupants in
   the event of a fire in buildings},
Journal = {ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 12},
Abstract = {In the operational phase of buildings, tracking what modifications can
   have an impact on the expected facility performances through manual
   checks can be impractical, albeit very important from a facility
   management perspective. The transition from the traditional prescriptive
   method towards the performance-based approach for building design and
   management may facilitate quantitative assessment of performances and
   may lead to conscious decisions which includes preparedness in the event
   of emergencies. The main goal of this paper is to develop a framework,
   compliant with a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment, to
   track fire safety performance levels, in terms of life safety of
   occupants. As long as this is done through the definition of Key
   Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are being tracked continuously,
   facility managers can have a comprehensive and updated overview of
   current performances of a facility. More specifically, a single
   representative KPI was set and evaluated for several fire scenarios,
   using a set of simulation and data management tools. The results of the
   assessment were processed and transformed into a visual representation,
   referenced to a grid superimposed over the building layout to
   quantitatively represent the safety of occupants at every point of the
   building. The results were then sent back and displayed into the BIM
   model, for seamless accessibility by facility managers. The proposed
   methodology was tested on a pilot building, assuming two fire scenarios.
   This approach enabled supervision of a building's compliance with fire
   safety requirements, in terms of occupants' life safety, throughout the
   building lifecycle.},

Abstract = {The current design approach recommended by seismic codes is often based
   on the use of uniform-hazard response spectra, reduced to account for
   inelastic structural behaviour. This approach has some strong
   limitations that have been highlighted in many studies, including not
   allowing a direct control of the seismic risk and losses. This study
   aims at quantifying the levels of safety and the costs associated with
   this design approach, and to investigate alternative design approaches
   that have been developed in the last decades. In particular, a
   risk-targeting approach and a minimum-cost approach are considered. The
   first one, allowed by US codes, aims at designing structures with the
   same risk of collapse throughout regions of different seismicity. The
   second one aims to minimize the sum of the initial construction cost and
   the cost of expected losses due to future earthquakes. The comparison of
   the three approaches is performed by considering, as an example
   structure, a four-storey reinforced concrete frame building located in
   different areas in Europe, and by looking at the implications in terms
   of achieved safety levels, initial costs, and future losses. The study's
   results provide useful information on how the design criteria and the
   different hazard levels throughout Europe affect the cost and safety
   levels of seismic design.},

Title = {Development of a Multi-Objective Sizing Method for Borehole Heat
   Exchangers during the Early Design Phase},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems coupled with borehole heat
   exchangers (BHEs) are widely used as a renewable energy source. However,
   the high initial costs to install the BHEs still acts as an obstacle in
   the expansion of these renewable energy source systems. Specifically, in
   South Korea, a typical residential type corresponds to an apartment
   building with a high building-to-land ratio for land efficiency, and
   thus the space to install the BHEs is usually insufficient. Furthermore,
   the high initial cost issue of BHEs makes it difficult to ensure the
   feasibility of GSHP projects in this type of a situation. This study
   proposes a novel BHE sizing method to support the process of sizing
   energy sources in the design development phase of a construction
   project. Life cycle cost (LCC) analysis was combined with a tool to
   optimize BHE sizing by considering various economic aspects. Entering
   water temperatures (EWT) to heat pumps in conjunction with the LCC were
   used to define objective functions. Consequently, Pareto optimal
   solutions were obtained on the EWT-LCC plot. A group of Pareto optimal
   solutions forms a Pareto-curve, and each point on the curve indicates a
   possible sizing scenario or alternative. Finally, it is possible for
   decision makers to compare the solutions that include both technical and
   economic information. The Pareto optimal solutions are expected to
   support proper decision making in the early design phase.},

Abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) system is considered an unlimited source of clean
   energy, whose amount of electricity generation changes according to the
   monthly average daily solar radiation (MADSR). It is revealed that the
   MADSR distribution in South Korea has very diverse patterns due to the
   country's climatic and geographical characteristics. This study aimed to
   develop a MADSR estimation model for the location without the measured
   MADSR data, using an advanced case based reasoning (CBR) model, which is
   a hybrid methodology combining CBR with artificial neural network,
   multiregression analysis, and genetic algorithm. The average prediction
   accuracy of the advanced CBR model was very high at 95.69\%, and the
   standard deviation of the prediction accuracy was 3.67\%, showing a
   significant improvement in prediction accuracy and consistency. A case
   study was conducted to verify the proposed model. The proposed model
   could be useful for owner or construction manager in charge of
   determining whether or not to introduce the PV system and where to
   install it. Also, it would benefit contractors in a competitive bidding
   process to accurately estimate the electricity generation of the PV
   system in advance and to conduct an economic and environmental

Abstract = {Our proposal concerns ongoing research at the University of Burgundy, in
   collaboration with Active3D-Lab Company, for the development of a method
   to manage civil engineering projects and corresponding facilities
   management. This method is made up of processes, specific models and
   tools. The processes make it possible to structure the various phases,
   codified by professionals, which organize the lifecycle of buildings.
   Construction and a building's life information comes from heterogeneous
   sources (heterogeneity of professions, heterogeneity of data formats,
   and heterogeneity of validation processes). We propose an innovative
   approach which gives a global view of a buildings lifecycle including
   facilities management aspect. This approach is based on a data model
   standard called IFC which was developed by the International Alliance
   for Interoperability. A collaborative Internet platform was developed to
   support the building lifecycle. This platform is mainly used to federate
   all the actions realized on a building during its lifecycle, to merge
   all information relating to these actions in an adaptive hypermedia
   graph, to extract some trade views of the building by combining
   information collected during the lifecycle from heterogeneous sources
   and to handle all these views through a dynamic and adaptive 3D
   interface. This platform won the technological innovation gold medal at
   the international show BATIMAT in Paris in November 2003.},

   trend which could be forecasted relatively easily. As a consequent,
   enterprise to survival depends on its capability to accommodating
   changes in manufacturing environment. Due to the rareness of data in the
   early stages of manufacturing management, traditional prediction
   techniques hardly obtain ideal results. The urgency of learning and
   acquirement of the management knowledge is unavoidable for decision
   makers. Therefore, small-data-set prediction cannot be ignored and
   should be taken seriously.
   Nowadays the grey prediction model is one of the important methods for
   small-data-set prediction. But its application is limited because the
   way of building model is fixed and could not be modified by the
   characteristics of data. This research explores the extra information
   with data analysis through trend and potency tracking method, and uses
   the generation of trend and potency value of each datum to develop the
   adaptive grey prediction model as a tool of small-data-set prediction
   based on the theory of grey system. The example verification displayed
   that the presented method establishes the suitable model according to
   the characteristics of data, and also improves the prediction accuracy
   of small data sets.},

Title = {Do all roads lead to Rome? A comparison of knowledge-based, data-driven,
   and physics-based surrogate models for performance-based early design},
Journal = {ENGINEERING STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {286},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {A performance-based early design must assess the life cycle performance
   of a sizable design space at low computational cost and limited data.
   This paper evaluates the relative capabilities of three surrogate
   modeling approaches to estimate seismic loss under complete and
   incomplete design information scenarios. Three surrogate models of
   knowledge-based (i.e., from prior published assessments), data-driven
   (i.e., support vector machine trained on a simulation-based building
   inventory), and physics-based (i.e., equivalent single-degree-offreedom
   systems) are systematically used to estimate bounds on direct seismic
   loss for four hypothetical concrete office construction projects in
   Charleston, South Carolina. Subsequently, a framework is presented that
   implements these surrogate models as a sequence to explore design
   alternatives consistent with divergenceconvergence cycles of early
   design exploration. The results show that all different surrogate models
   provide reasonable accuracy for the complete design information case,
   whereas data-driven models provided higher accuracy than the other
   models. For incomplete design information, the data-driven models
   demarcated the performance space and estimated the same median loss
   values as detailed loss analysis. In contrast, physics-based surrogate
   models were more accurate in capturing the relationship between loss and
   design parameters for smaller sets of design alternatives. Nevertheless,
   all different surrogate modeling techniques were inadequate to capture
   loss variability between different designs of the same geometry.},

Abstract = {Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. There have
   been many changes in the past few years in the use of BIM and how to
   implement BIM in the AEC Industry. The purpose of this research is to
   examine the current status of BIM in the Middle East by exploring the
   extent of adoption of BIM among stakeholders in the AEC industry in this
   region. To this end surveys were sent out to 297 and empirical
   statistics have been applied. The respondents acknowledged they were
   aware of the benefits of BIM in terms of it being a more effective
   method for designing and managing construction projects by supporting
   collaboration, improving the quality of the design by providing the
   ability to closely visualize designs in 3D and rendered forms and
   providing a platform which would facilitate the sharing of information
   relevant for design, construction and maintenance of buildings over
   their entire lifecycle. However, only 20\% of AEC organizations in the
   Middle East are using BIM or are in the process of adopting BIM, with
   more professionals beginning to adopt BIM although most professionals
   within this region still look at BIM just as an advanced AutoCAD tool.
   Raising awareness related to the benefits of BIM and increasing training
   opportunities in the Middle East are necessary in order to allow all
   stakeholders to benefit substantially from BIM.},

Abstract = {One of the critical tasks of the International Energy Agency's Energy
   Conservation in Buildings and Communities Program's (IEC ECBC's) Annex
   61 Business and Technical Concepts for Deep Energy Retrofit (DER) of
   Public Buildings is to develop bundles of core technologies (measures),
   which, when applied in major renovation projects to older, pre-1980
   buildings, allow site energy reduction by 50\% or better compared to the
   pre-renovation baseline. A short list of these technologies has been
   generated through analysis of DER projects (Zhivov et al. 2015).
   Characteristics of some of these ``core technologies{''} depend on
   technologies available on an individual nation's market, minimum
   requirements of national standards, and life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis.
   In addition to these factors, requirements for building envelope-related
   technologies (e.g., insulation levels, windows), depend on specific
   climate conditions. This paper presents the results of computational
   modeling analysis conducted by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and
   Development Center team to determine the performance potential of the
   core technologies for two categories of buildings with relatively low
   internal loads in 15 U.S. climates using the net zero planner tool. This
   tool enabled simultaneous simulation of multiple building types and
   multiple technology bundles of energy efficiency measures in different
   climate zones. This research supported development of requirements for
   building envelope characteristics and typical equipment best practices
   for DER projects. Information presented in the paper along with results
   of similar studies conducted in Denmark, Estonia, Austria, Germany,
   China, and the UK (Riel et al. 2016; Yao et al. 2016; Zhivov 2016) for
   their nation-specific climate conditions have been used to develop
   general guidelines for technology bundles to be used in DER projects
   (Zhivov et al. 2016). Results of these studies show that 50\% of site
   energy use reduction can be achieved in most climate conditions using a
   limited number of technologies readily available on the market. It is
   easier to reduce energy consumption in heating-dominated climates than
   in climates requiring cooling and humidity control. Additional energy
   efficiency technologies and measures specific to the building type and
   use, as well as to specific climate conditions, can further reduce
   energy use intensity of the building and allow achievement of even
   higher performance buildings (e.g., passive house standard or even net
   zero energy).},

Title = {A semantic web-based risk assessment framework for collaborative
   planning to enhance overall supply chain effectiveness for semiconductor
   industry},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Semiconductor supply chain uncertainty is increasingly complicated due
   to shortening product life cycles, demand fluctuation and a series of
   collaborative decisions, yet little research focuses on risk assessment
   from operational planning level to supply chain planning level.
   Limitations of existing approaches can be traced in part to the lack of
   a framework within which the decisions involved in different levels can
   be integrated and aligned in light of supply chain dynamics. This study
   aims to develop a semantic web based risk assessment framework to
   integrate collaborative planning and enable the interpretability among
   real world and simulation modelling. This study starts by proposing a
   performance elevation metric from interpreting planning level for
   overall supply chain effectiveness. This study further constructs an
   ontology for planning and control decisions to support building the risk
   assessment simulation model to ensure information system
   interoperability and link domain knowledge for semiconductor supply
   chain network resilience. For validation, a simulation model is
   constructed for backend production from a leading semiconductor company
   in Germany. The contribution of the proposed semantic web-based
   framework provides the interoperability for supporting supply chain
   management and reduces the gaps between simulation modelling and
   physical setting to enhance overall supply chain effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The fundamental purpose of test and evaluation of a Department of
   Defense (DoD) acquisition program is to generate data that enables
   accurate understanding and knowledge about a system's operational
   performance in support of key acquisition or program decisions. The
   Integrated Decision Support Key (IDSK) is defined in DoD policy to
   effectively enable this purpose by linking key acquisition or program
   decisions to the four high-level operational metrics-effectiveness,
   suitability, survivability, and lethality-and test data or modeling and
   simulation results supporting them. This connection between decisions
   and the data supporting them is a dynamic process that captures the
   evolution of our understanding of the operational performance of the
   system as it matures across its life cycle, becoming more definitive as
   more data become available. In its optimized form, the IDSK is a
   dynamic, data-driven decision support tool. The utility of the IDSK can
   be maximized with adequately established connections to information
   spanning multiple phases of test and environments. Despite this promise,
   implementing the IDSK has proven a challenge, primarily due to the lack
   of well-defined but flexible IDSK data models with suggested information
   content and accompanying tools for building them in such a way that does
   not require specialized technical expertise. We have largely overcome
   this challenge and present four IDSK exemplars in this article to
   demonstrate how this decision support key can be developed based on
   well-defined but flexible data models using a variety of tools. We
   provide links to interactive versions of these items, including an
   easy-to-use prototype can start using now to explore and build digital

Title = {Remote interactive collaboration in facilities management using
   BIM-based mixed reality},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Facilities Management (FM) day-to-day tasks require suitable methods to
   facilitate work orders and improve performance by better collaboration
   between the office and the field. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the
   efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by
   sharing building information between different applications/users
   throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of
   building element information can be challenging and time consuming for
   field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a
   visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of
   the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information
   on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses
   the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support
   facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource
   facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an
   MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection
   schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and
   maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual
   communication between the field worker and the manager at the office.
   The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on
   his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented
   Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on
   the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance
   schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from
   the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide
   additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the
   field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about
   existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in
   an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate
   the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is
   developed and tested in a case study.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is an innovative way of producing complex parts.
   There is abundant knowledge about mechanical properties and production
   costs, with many studies in the literature reporting comparisons between
   different additive manufacturing technologies based on technical or
   economic criteria. However, there has been only limited environmental
   analysis of what happens during the manufacturing stage. Most of the
   studies concern the specific energy consumption and only rely on
   electrical consumption of the machine during the building process. In
   this paper, environmental impact is based on life cycle inventory data
   (energy, material, fluid). To ensure the continuing development of these
   processes, it is important to develop predictive models of the
   environmental impact, so that products can be evaluated not only from a
   technical and economic perspective, but also from an environmental point
   of view. This paper describes a new methodology for developing
   predictive models to jointly evaluate technical, economic, and
   environmental data. First, the authors propose a generic method to study
   the environmental aspects during the manufacturing stage. Then, these
   aspects are combined technical and cost information. This methodology
   can be applied to numerous additive manufacturing processes and will
   enable manufacturers to choose manufacturing technology or machine based
   on multiple criteria.},

Title = {Application of functional modelling in the design of industrial control

Journal = {RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Industrial control systems are gradually becoming more and more complex
   putting still stronger demands on their design. Difficulties in meeting
   these requirements have led to increased costs in production of control
   systems, and to systems that can be hard to understand and maintain and
   even may fail in satisfying desired reliability figures. One step
   towards a minimisation of these problems is to look for design methods
   which can address more effectively the special problems involved in
   control systems design. The paper presents a new design method called
   Goal Function Modelling (GFM), developed particularly for (reuse-based)
   design of complex industrial control systems. Founded upon ideas from
   the domain of functional modelling, GFM has a strong concern for the
   concept of function, and for identification and organisation of
   different kinds of knowledge. Combined with a careful attention to
   practical issues, these capabilities have been embedded in a design
   model providing an effective framework for organisation of design
   descriptions for complex systems. The features include support for
   separation of knowledge associated to different system properties, and
   for building links between related pieces of information. Both are
   essential for production of design descriptions which are relatively
   easy to understand, verify, and maintain, and therefore should have the
   potential for bringing about control systems with reduced life-cycle
   costs and increased quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Marine systems are not as well understood as terrestrial systems, and
   there is still a great need for more primary observations, in the
   tradition of the old-time naturalists, before newer methods such as
   molecular genetics and modeling can be fully utilized. The scientific
   process whereby the smaller, detailed ``building blocks{''} of
   observation are ultimately linked towards better understanding natural
   systems is illustrated from my own career experience, especially with
   regard to the dinoflagellates and plankton blooms. Some dinoflagellates
   produce a fossilizable resting stage (cyst) in their life cycle, and
   dinoflagellate cysts have become one of the most important groups of
   microfossils used in geological exploration (e.g. oil and gas). This has
   stimulated both paleontological and biological research producing
   detailed ``building blocks{''} of information, currently scattered
   throughout the respective literature. Here, I attempt to bring together
   the present day perspective, from biology, with the past, from
   paleontology, as the most comprehensive basis for future work on the
   group. This shows the cysts to be the critical link needed for focusing
   future molecular genetics studies towards a more verifiable view of
   evolutionary pathways, and it also suggests new integrated methods for
   studying past, present, and future blooms. The large, rapidly growing
   field of harmful algal bloom studies is producing many different
   ``building blocks{''}, but plankton blooms as episodic phenomena are
   still poorly understood. This is largely due to the general lack of
   long-term datasets allowing identification of the changing environmental
   factors that permit certain species to bloom at unpredictable intervals
   of time. Cysts in sediments are useful environmental indicators today,
   e.g. reflecting aspects of climate and pollution, and provide
   information directly relevant to some dinoflagellate blooms. They
   therefore may be used for obtaining retrospective information from the
   sedimentary record on the history of blooms, in turn suggesting
   information relevant for future blooms and the way we study them.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Pages = {472-488},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study investigates the carbon footprint of the
   alternative structure types and materials used for the reconstruction of
   schools in Haiti. Are recycled construction materials more environmental
   than virgin materials? To estimate which alternative construction
   solution has the smallest carbon footprint, a survey was made for the
   school model used for the reconstruction programme in Haiti after the
   2010 earthquake.
   Design/methodology/approach - The carbon footprint was calculated using
   life cycle assessment methodology for five different concrete structure
   alternatives and five different cement mixes for the same design of a
   school building. In addition, the uptake of CO2 through the carbonation
   of concrete during 50 years was calculated.
   Findings - The carbon footprint of recycled materials can be either the
   best or worst option, depending on how the materials are used. The
   difference to using virgin materials is not big. This is mainly due to
   the lower structural performance of recycled materials, which needs to
   be compensated for by using additional reinforcements. Using cement
   mixes that have high amounts of substitutes for cement seems to lower
   the carbon footprint of structures considerably. The uptake of CO2 in
   carbonation has potential but requires an optimal design and
   environment.
   Originality/value - The findings give information for humanitarian
   project managers and designers on lowering the carbon footprint of their
   construction projects.},

   FOUNDATIONS OF FREEZING WET SOILS},
Journal = {LIGHT \& ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The temperature and humidity state of the foundations and foundations in
   the climatic conditions of the Russian Federation is decisive in their
   design, it affects the bearing capacity, operational reliability, and
   durability of the foundations and the entire building. When designing
   foundations and foundations, they solve a set of tasks that are
   subordinated to one idea, so that the soil (base) he carried the load
   from the building or structure proposed to him, and the foundation
   structure itself would ensure reliable operation of the building or
   structure for the entire life cycle, since the foundations belong to
   permanent structures, and their repair is associated with large material
   costs. Existing modern calculation methods assume that the heat transfer
   process is stationary and do not consider real processes - seasonal and
   daily fluctuations in outdoor air temperature, heating on and off modes,
   temperature changes in the depth of the soil, wet structures due to
   accidents of heating plants, the absence (or destruction) of a blind
   area, etc. Freezing of soils, as a rule, occurs in autumn- winter
   period, when the soil is saturated with moisture. Thawing of the soil
   occurs in the spring- summer period. These processes are non -stationary
   in nature, which is influenced by many factors, including solar
   radiation. The work is devoted to modelling and calculation of these
   real processes. The process of freezing and thaw ing of the foundation
   soils is influenced by many factors: the composition of the soil, water,
   ice, snow, solar radiation, fluctuations in outdoor temperature. The
   paper provides general information about some of the physical properties
   of water, ice, and snow, necessary for understanding the processes under
   consideration.},

Abstract = {The carbon neutrality of the built environment plays a key role in
   fighting the climate crisis and fully realising ecological transition.
   In this field, the aim of the paper is to promote a new production
   paradigm that enables an integrated process from the design phase to the
   production of high-performance building components, to their
   ``tailor-made installation{''} for the efficiency enhancement of the
   national residential building stock, reducing resource consumptions,
   costs, construction time and the associated environmental impact. The
   methodological approach is based on three key elements: digitalisation,
   production and performance. Recent technologies make it possible to
   achieve important goals, through the creation of the digital cataloguing
   of existing buildings, advanced dynamic simulations, improved energy
   performance for building stock and industrial production chain
   optimisation of the construction sector according to off-site
   construction criteria. This strategy was tested on a demonstrator
   building. The methodology application has made it possible to validate a
   catalogue of standardised insulation solutions that can be applied to
   90\% of the existing national building stock and that can reduce
   installation times by 60\% and costs by around 30\% compared to
   traditional techniques, while complying with the national requirements
   on thermal building insulation. The study is able to organise production
   according to advanced standardisation in order to meet the real demand
   of the market with advantages in term of production costs and economies

Abstract = {Society and the business world are paying more and more attention to the
   Circular Economy (CE) principles. The construction industry is no
   stranger to this issue, and the companies are transitioning towards
   sustainable production models. However, it is not easy to predict when
   and to what extent a company implements the CE. To measure this process,
   a scorecard, that includes the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of
   the construction industry, related to the CE, was designed. Thus, the
   objective of this article is to design and test the CE-dashboard
   applicable to the construction industry. To do it, firstly, a literature
   review is performed. The next step is the selection of the KPIs
   collected in the literature, more suitable for reporting information
   about CE. Afterwards, a simulation based on the Monte Carlo technique
   performs. After multiple iterations, this method establishes the most
   probable KPI values as a result, which will be confronted with the
   limits used in the scorecard. With all this information, the dashboard
   emerges in Qlik software. Finally, a test of this dashboard takes place
   according to the information about KPIs from one of the leading Spanish
   companies (General Contractor (GC) building company). This step brings
   the validity of the created measurement instrument.},

Abstract = {Enterprises are rather complex systems which have to be managed for
   their internal affairs, but more importantly for the many relations to
   the different environments in which they are operating. Today, these
   environments are changing much more rapidly and the need for relevant
   information becomes of paramount importance in the decision making
   processes at all levels of enterprise management, Fluctuations in market
   demands, technology evolution and changing regulations require very
   flexible enterprise operations, capable of reacting to those changes.
   These reactions must be based on relevant and up-to-date information
   which must be supported by new decision support technology. The
   challenges in decision support concern the identification of relevant
   information, easy access and intelligent use of this information.
   Building and maintaining the enterprise knowledge base and enabling its
   efficient use for decision support are major tasks of enterprise
   engineering. Enterprise integration and its subsequent operation in the
   global environment of customers, suppliers and regulatory bodies will
   heavily depend on the availability and the continuous extension of this
   knowledge base. Enterprise modelling will play an important role in
   creating the knowledge base and in using it for enterprise integration
   and operational decision support. The paper discusses enterprise
   engineering as an enterprise life-cycle oriented discipline for
   identification, design, and implementation of enterprises and their
   continuous evolution. Current problems in the field are identified and
   initiatives are presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In this paper we present a new architecture for integrating system
   health monitoring tasks into the development- and life cycle of space
   systems. On the basis of model-supported diagnosis technology the
   presented method uses information for diagnosis purposes that is already
   gathered during the development of a technical system. This information
   is extracted from simulation models used for design-studies and
   what-if-analyses during the design- and development phase. For building
   up these simulation models easily, we developed a library of generic
   models of spacecraft components. These models cover the components'
   nominal and off-non-final behavior as it is specified in the component
   FMECAs. By combining and parametrizing the components a system model is
   built up. Since due to the limited resources on board of a spacecraft we
   can not use the model directly for model-based diagnosis, we use a
   model-supported approach: By systematically simulating possible
   component faults within the system's operational modes, we retrieve a
   set of measurement data that serve as symptoms to the failure modes. By
   classifying these data we get a knowledge-base for a symptom-based
   on-board diagnosis system. In order to cope with the uncertainty in the
   measurement data, this diagnosis system has been realized as a fuzzy
   system that on the basis of the given knowledge-base computes the most
   probable diagnoses from the given symptoms. The described system has
   been implemented within Astrium's Columbus Ground System (CGS) and has
   been evaluated on several aerospace systems ranging from an unmanned
   aerial robot on the basis of an airship to the Propulsion and Reboost
   Subsystem of the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), a supply spacecraft
   for the International Space Station.},

Title = {Microclimate spatio-temporal prediction using deep learning and land use
   data},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {253},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Urban microclimate prediction is crucial for various fields, including
   Building Performance Simulation (BPS), outdoor thermal comfort, building
   life cycle, and residential health. Existing methods involve using
   classical weather file data, such as Typical Meteorological Years (TMY),
   or machine learning techniques for time-based forecasting. However, the
   incorporation of both spatial and temporal dimensions and land use/land
   cover (LULC) data is seldom considered. This paper proposes a novel
   approach to predict microclimate: the GeoLSTM-Kriging model, which is
   applicable for fine-scale microclimate prediction within a few hundred
   meters around weather stations. The Geo -layer processes and learns from
   LULC data, the LSTM layer learns from historical data, and the Kriging
   layer extracts spatial distance information. This comprehensive
   combination integrates spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions,
   providing accurate results with higher spatial resolution (1 m x 1 m)
   and shorter time intervals (10 min). These prediction results were
   achieved by employing statistical downscaling calculation and utilizing
   data from 14 weather stations located within our university campus. Upon
   the analysis of these prediction results, we found that the proposed
   model can accurately predict temperature and humidity at high spatial
   and temporal resolution. Compared to traditional interpolation models,
   the RMSE of temperature decreases from 1.59 degrees C to 0.64 degrees C,
   and the RMSE of relative humidity (RH) decreases from 7.70 to 3.23. A
   thorough analysis of the model prediction results reveals the varied
   impacts of different LULC features on microclimate predictions,
   highlighting the value of the proposed model and the importance of
   incorporating LULC data.},

Abstract = {Facility maintenance is critical to the proper function and utilization
   of facilities and fit and function are highly important to dormitories.
   This study analyzed 39,093 work orders from a US Air Force Computerized
   Maintenance Management System (CMMS) in order to holistically reveal the
   most common dormitory facility defects and their associated costs and
   the effect of preventative maintenance. Actual deficiencies and concrete
   costs can motivate owners, designers, and facility managers (FMs) to
   incorporate maintainability in early planning and design stages to
   reduce the overall life-cycle costs of the facility. The study found
   that most maintenance costs were associated with heating, ventilation
   and air conditioning (HVAC), water and gas systems, and architectural
   finishes and paint. The study also found that the total cost of the
   average work order was primarily influenced by labor costs. Critically,
   this study quantified the correlation between preventative maintenance
   (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM) and emergency work order labor
   hours, finding that PM was inversely related to CM and emergency labor
   hours. Finally, this paper suggests ways to improve maintainability
   decision-making in design, and operations and maintenance. (c) 2021

Title = {Building an ontological knowledgebase for bridge maintenance},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {24-40},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The operation stage has the biggest potential value in the bridge life
   cycle management, and it often critically influences the overall cost of
   the bridge. As such, changes in the efficiency of the project's
   operation stage could be of significant benefit to the overall project.
   However, current approaches in the operation stage often lack the
   effective support of computer-aided tools. This research presents a
   holistic method based on an ontology to achieve automatic rule checking
   and improve the management and communication of knowledge related to
   bridge maintenance. The developed ontology can also facilitate a smarter
   decision-making process for bridge management by informing engineers of
   choices with different considerations. Three approaches; semantic
   validation, syntactical validation, and case study validation, have been
   adopted to evaluate this ontology and demonstrate how the developed
   ontology can be used by engineers when dealing with different issues.
   The results showed that this approach can create a holistic knowledge
   base that can integrate various domain knowledge to enable bridge
   engineers to make more comprehensive decisions rather than a single
   objective-targeted delivery.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is a new and powerful technology
   implemented by many countries. The construction industry in Jordan plays
   a vital role and contributes immensely to the economic growth and
   development. In order to boost the industry and the economy, many
   industry players including engineers and contractors have recommended
   the implementation of BIM in Jordan. However, research demonstrates that
   successful BIM implementation is possible through the awareness of the
   different levels of BIM, which is a basic precondition for BIM
   implementation. Without a clear understanding of BIM, many companies
   would be unable to fully achieve BIM potentials or implement BIM in
   their building lifecycle. The objective of this study is to assess the
   current awareness of BIM technology in the Jordanian construction
   industry. A field interviews were conducted and 15 responses were
   collected and. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of
   respondents have little or no understanding of the concept of BIM. Also,
   the usage was found to be very low. Based on the results, a holistic
   roadmap was developed to spread the BIM adoption through the Jordanian
   construction industry. It is expected that this roadmap would lead to a
   better understanding and enable the industry towards more extensive
   implementation of BIM.},

Abstract = {There is a beneficial effect when integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) with lean practices to identify and reduce waste in the
   construction industry. According to experts, it is possible to improve
   the design process through waste reduction by implementing lean
   practices and BIM. An unexplored perspective on these synergies concerns
   the relationship between the specific uses of BIM and lean practices.
   Therefore, this study analyzed the relationships between Lean Design
   Management (LDM) practices and BIM uses in the planning and design
   phases of the infrastructure lifecycle. To achieve this objective, the
   research was organized into three stages: (1) the explanation of LDM
   practices and BIM uses; (2) the characterization of sample projects and
   data collection strategies; and (3) data exploration, including
   reliability analysis, descriptive statistics, association analysis, and
   a causal analysis of LDM practices and BIM uses. The analysis of the
   relationship between LDM practices and BIM uses generated empirical
   evidence of the implementation of BIM uses and lean management practices
   at the design phase. LDM practices from the categories planning and
   control and problem-solving and decision-making were more related to BIM
   uses than LDM practices from the category stakeholder management.
   Additionally, it was concluded that if a project applies a higher
   proportion of BIM uses, it will tend to apply a higher proportion of LDM
   practices; however, this relationship is not as clear in the other way
   around.},

Abstract = {With the increasing need for energy efficient occupant comfort, the
   maintenance process becomes a key factor. Aspects including failure
   response time, maintenance treatment time and maintainability have a
   great influence on the building occupant comfort. Normally, the
   efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance process largely rely on the
   knowledge the maintenance workers have and the right notifications.
   However, occupants are not generally skilled in such field, and they
   most likely send the wrong information while failing to find the right
   person in charge. That will cause the longer response time. In this
   regards, this study intends to develop a building facility maintenance
   Knowledge Base (KB) more visually. Particularly, OpenGL was used to make
   the process of case-based reasoning directly perceived through senses.
   Meanwhile, using Building Information Models (BIM) simplified the
   process of developing a 3D Knowledge-Based System (KBS). Moreover,
   Microsoft Access database was set up to provide search and update
   functions for the KB. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed
   system was examined by this paper. However, the proposed Knowledge-Based
   System is limited to the complexity in facility manufacturers, protocol
   used and discreteness in hardware. Moreover, the operation conditions of
   building facilities vary in different projects. Therefore, the accuracy
   and volume of the KB should be further optimized. In futuristic
   research, more real-world buildings will be applied on to validate and
   improve the proposed system.},

Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC-FM) industry is increasingly affected by digital technologies that
   monitor sensor network data and control automation systems. Advances in
   digital technologies like Digital Twin offer a high-level representation
   of buildings and their assets by integrating the physical and digital
   world. This paper examines patterns, gaps, and trends in the AEC-FM
   sector and contributes to digitalization and automation solutions for
   building management. This work covers a broad range of research topics,
   from intelligent information management of complex models to building
   information management and the interaction of building systems, where
   researchers are increasingly interested in using the Digital Twin to
   manage their information and in developing new research lines focused on
   data interchange and the interoperability of building information
   modeling (BIM) and facility management (FM). After a complete
   bibliometric search of several databases and following selection
   criteria, 77 academic publications about the Digital Twin application in
   the AEC-FM industry were labeled and clustered accordingly. This study
   analyzed in detail the concept of key technologies, including ``Digital
   Twin in Facility Lifecycle Management,{''} ``Digital Twin-Information
   Integration Standards,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Occupants Centric
   Building Design,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Predictive Maintenance,{''}
   ``Semantic Digital Twin for Facility Maintenance,{''} and ``Digital
   Twin-Based Human Knowledge.{''} The findings show that information
   standardization is the first major hurdle that must be overcome before
   the actual use of Digital Twin can be realized in the AEC-FM industry.
   Based on that, this paper provides a conceptual framework of Digital
   Twin for building management as a starting point for future research.},

Abstract = {The systems that support construction and maintenance planning for
   delivering the road digital transformation lack the up-to-date road data
   and digital processes to leverage them. Digital twins recently disrupted
   the infrastructure sector and can now serve as a fundamental building
   block to help address this problem. Digital twin differs significantly
   from a static design-stage BIM model. It can span across the road's life
   cycle for reflecting the physical twin's properties, updating data
   continuously, and improving connectivity. However, no implementation of
   such digital twin solutions exists on the horizon for infrastructure.
   The important items that have not been defined yet are workable digital
   twin data structures and cloud architecture. This study aims to develop
   a proof-of-concept digital twin data structure and an integrated cloud
   architecture that are able to support road products and processes. The
   outcomes of this research are the proposed data structures and developed
   road digital twin integrated cloud architecture. As reliable references,
   these data structures benefit people by applying digital twin
   technologies to facilitate road construction and O\&M processes and
   improve the decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {Knowledge intensive engineering aims at flexible applications of a
   variety of product life cycle knowledge. much as design, manufacturing.
   operations, maintenance, and recycling. Many engineering domain theories
   are organized and embedded within CAD and CAE tools and engineering
   activities can be formalized as modeling operations to them. Since most
   of domain theories deal with the physical world and can be associated
   with physical concepts. a physical concept ontology can form a common
   ontology to integrate engineering models that are formed based on domain
   theories. This paper reports a physical ontology-based support system
   for knowledge intensive engineering called Knowledge intensive
   Engineering Framework (KIEF) to integrate multiple engineering models
   and to allow more flexible use of them. First the paper describes the
   physical ontology as the core of KIEF and an ontology-based reasoning
   system called a pluggable metamodel mechanism, to integrate and maintain
   relationships among these models. The pluggable metamodel mechanism uses
   a metamodel that represents the designer's mental model about a design
   object as a concept network model. The designer builds and decomposes a
   functional hierarchy from functional specifications with an FBS
   (Function-Behavior-State) modeler. He/She then maps the functional
   hierarchy into a metamodel using physical features that are building
   blocks for conceptual design. Then, the pluggable metamodel mechanism
   enriches the information contained in the metamodel by using causal
   dependency knowledge about the physical world and by budding and
   analzing various engineering models. We demonstrate the power of KIEF by
   illustrating a design case performed on KIEF. (C) 2004 Published by

Abstract = {Lifecycle building performance assessment (LBPA) ensures that buildings
   perform and operate as intended during building lifecycle. Such
   assessment activities are typically multi-phase and multi-disciplinary,
   and generate large amounts of information that need efficient
   management. During the lifecycle of one building, multiple assessment
   methods are employed semi-concurrently and with a great deal of
   information overlap between successive phases. This information is
   semantically rich and context-dependent, reflecting the local
   perspective that it exists within. Usage of separate and disconnected
   tools for each method results in information fragmentation and
   redundancy, posing problems for well-informed decision making. The
   objective of this research is to develop an integral reference model,
   CLIP (Computational support for Lifecycle Integral Performance
   assessment), that aims to improve the efficiency and quality of existing
   performance assessment practices. The model provides flexible, modular,
   and extensible data structures and algorithms for the representation,
   transformation, integration, and visualization of performance
   information. The initial results support the CLIP model's ability to
   deal with the local volatility and variation in the processes and
   information content that is being managed, while requiring further
   refinement and extension work to achieve a customized solution to fit in
   different contextual settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Research progress of long-life asphalt pavement behavior based on the
   RIOHTrack full-scale accelerated loading test},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {3247-3258},
Abstract = {Full-scale accelerated loading test is an efficient and effective method
   for simulating and studying long-term pavement performance because its
   loading and environment conditions are similar to those of real-world
   applications. In the past decades, this method has been recognized as an
   important support for the development of pavement design theory'
   worldwide. In 2000, the long-life pavement was first presented by the
   researchers in Europe and the USA to obtain the most economical pavement
   during the whole life cycle. However. the completed design method of the
   long-life asphalt pavement has not been provided, especially for
   semi-rigid base asphalt pavement. In 2015, the Research Institute of
   Highway. Ministry of Transport constructed a 2.038-km-long full-scale
   field accelerated pavement testing track, which was named as RIOHTrack,
   to develop a long-life pavement suitable for China. The testing road has
   25 asphalt pavement structure sections, and the average length of the
   testing section is 60 m. In all of the testing sections there were 19
   structural testing sections, which are classified into six types,
   namely, the thin asphalt layer semi-rigid base pavement, the normal
   semi-rigid base pavement used in China, the composite pavement, the
   inverted pavements, the thick asphalt layer asphalt pavement, and the
   full-depth asphalt pavement respectively. In the first research phase.
   RIOHTrack planned to complete 50 million equivalent single axle loads
   ESALs (10 tons standard axle loading) by using trucks under the real
   environment. During the accelerated loading, two types of pavement
   performance detections were conducted. The first type is the realtime
   strain/stress responses and the environment information captured by the
   monitor sensors, and the other type is the periodic pavement performance
   detection measured by auto-detecting devices or artificial measures. In
   this paper, the bearing capacity. service performances. and inner
   mechanism responses under the couple of loading and environment were
   analyzed on the basis of the whole detecting data captured from December
   2016 to January 2020. Four main conclusions were drawn. First, the
   influence of loading and environment on performance is considerably. and
   the influence degree of environment is even larger than that caused by
   the loading. Second, the pavement performance has structural dependence,
   the ranking of the six main types varies if evaluated using different
   performance indices. and the rutting depth prediction accuracy depends
   on the structural type. Third, the stress/strain monitoring results
   verify the nonlinear characteristic of asphalt pavement structure under
   the temperature and loading. To calculate the nonlinear effect in
   pavement behavior. a new mechanical analysis method was presented, which
   considers material and geometric nonlinearity theory. Lastly, to improve
   the prediction accuracy of the rutting depth, we utilized multivariate
   statistics to build the new prediction model based on the measured
   rutting depth data. and this model considers the changes in loading
   number and temperature change. The stage research results illustrate
   that the different type of pavement structure has its advantages and
   disadvantages, so the type of the long-life asphalt pavement should be
   multiple choice. China has the longest mileages of semi-rigid base
   asphalt pavements. Hence, long-life, semi-rigid base asphalt pavement
   building. and maintenance technology should be developed.
   More works should be carried out on mechanism analysis. prediction
   models, and failure criteria, and the accelerated loading test, such as
   RIOHTrack, will mainly provide support.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many studies have focused on the application of
   advanced technology as a way to improve management of construction
   safety management. A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), one of the key
   technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) development, enables objects
   and devices to sense and communicate environmental conditions; Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), a revolutionary technology in construction,
   integrates database and geometry into a digital model which provides a
   visualized way in all construction lifecycle management. This paper
   integrates BIM and WSN into a unique system which enables the
   construction site to visually monitor the safety status via a spatial,
   colored interface and remove any hazardous gas automatically. Many
   wireless sensor nodes were placed on an underground construction site
   and to collect hazardous gas level and environmental condition
   (temperature and humidity) data, and in any region where an abnormal
   status is detected, the BIM model will alert the region and an alarm and
   ventilator on site will start automatically for warning and removing the
   hazard. The proposed system can greatly enhance the efficiency in
   construction safety management and provide an important reference
   information in rescue tasks. Finally, a case study demonstrates the
   applicability of the proposed system and the practical benefits,
   limitations, conclusions, and suggestions are summarized for further

Abstract = {Purpose Previous studies on environmental impacts from domestic laundry
   have tended to focus solely on private washing machines and detergent.
   However, public procurement guidelines about the construction of laundry
   spaces may also be important. This article aims to expand the scope of
   previous work so that it also includes tumble drying and the building
   space. By doing this, we examine the potential for shared systems (which
   are common in Sweden) to reduce the environmental impacts of laundry
   activities, in comparison with consumer choices associated with machine
   operation (i.e., wash temperature and amount of detergent). Methods An
   LCA model was created using product information data from the European
   Union. Emissions from building use were taken from Swedish
   cradle-to-grave reports on energy-efficient buildings. The resulting
   model was run with additional sensitivity analysis of the variables, and
   the associated emissions from each of the scenarios were calculated.
   Results and discussion On average, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for
   private laundries in Sweden were estimated to be 190 g CO2 eq./kg
   laundry (washed and dried). If a shared laundry was used instead, the
   resulting emissions decreased by approximately 26\%. The greatest
   contribution to GHG emissions was the use of detergent (22-33\% of total
   emissions), followed by capital goods (11-38\% of total emissions).
   Conclusion Deciding to construct shared laundries in newly built
   apartment buildings in Sweden, rather than in-unit machines, would
   reduce the emissions from domestic laundry for these tenants by
   approximately 26\%. This is because materials used for manufacturing
   whitegoods, as well as the emissions associated with the building
   itself, play a much bigger role than previously thought. Additionally,
   since the cleaning efficiency of warm water and some of the components
   used in detergents rises with temperature, emissions from domestic
   laundering could for some consumers be reduced further by washing at
   higher temperature but with less detergent. This pattern could be seen
   in Sweden within regions with hard water, where the emissions from
   domestic laundry could be reduced by 6-12\%.},

Title = {Construction planning through 4D BIM-based virtual reality for light
   steel framing building projects},

Number = {5},
Pages = {1153-1173},

Abstract = {Purpose The construction industry has actively attempted to tackle the
   low-productivity issues arising from inefficient construction planning.
   It is imperative to understand how construction practitioners perceive
   technology integration in construction planning in light of emerging
   technologies. This study intended to uncover unique experimental
   findings by integrating 4D-building information modelling (BIM) to
   virtual reality (VR) technology during construction planning among
   construction professionals at light steel framing (LSF) projects.
   Design/methodology/approach The building industry participants were
   invited to provide inputs on two different construction planning
   methods: conventional and innovative methods. The conventional method
   involved the participants using traditional platforms such as 2D
   computer-aided design (CAD) and physical visualisation of paper-based
   construction drawings for the LSF assembly process with a Gantt Chart
   tool to complete construction planning-related tasks for the targeted
   project. Comparatively, participants are required to perform the same
   tasks using more innovative platforms like 4D-BIM in a VR environment.
   Findings A Charrette Test Method was used to validate the findings,
   highlighting an improvement in usability (+10.3\%), accuracy (+89.1\%)
   and speed (+30\%) using 4D BIM with VR compared to the conventional
   paper-based method. The findings are also validated by a paired t-test,
   which is supported by the rationality of the same findings. This study
   posits positive results for construction planning through the
   utilisation of modern practices and technologies. These findings are
   significant for the global construction industry facing low productivity
   issues, delays and certainty in terms of building delivery timelines due
   to poor construction planning. Originality/value This new blend of
   technologies-combining 4D BIM and VR in industrialised construction
   projects-potentially directs future initiatives to drive the efficiency
   of construction planning in the building lifecycle. The interactive
   BIM-based virtual environment would purposefully transform construction
   planning practices in order to deliver modern and more certain building
   construction methods with a focus on prefabrication processes.},

Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {278-289},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a systems information
   model (SIM) that is akin to a building information model (BIM) and can
   be used by asset managers and staff to make more informed and quicker
   decisions about maintenance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The problems associated with managing
   assets are examined alongside recent international efforts to
   standardize methods of data collection for meeting the objectives of
   owners. A case study in the domain of electrical, control and
   instrumentation (ECI) documentation is examined in detail, with
   particular reference to the amelioration of errors and omissions in ``as
   built{''} drawings in order to provide the underlying foundation to
   support effective asset management (AM).
   Findings - The findings show that object oriented data models such as
   SIM provide a robust structure for effective and efficient AM and
   associated leverage of benefits throughout the entire facility lifecycle
   of a project. In particular object oriented data enables appropriate and
   reliable information to be created as a project progresses through its
   lifecycle, at little cost to the creators.
   Originality/value - The above special approach to enabling data
   collection at the point of creation is in alignment with recent
   Government initiatives such as Construction Operations Building
   Information Exchange, which are beginning to gather traction within the
   industry. While the potential benefits for AM of such systems are
   espoused throughout the industry, there are few successful examples in
   existence with measurable realization of benefits.},

Title = {The IFC-based path planning for 3D indoor spaces},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {189-205},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Path planning is a fundamental problem, especially for various AEC
   applications, such as architectural design, indoor and outdoor
   navigation, and emergency evacuation. However, the conventional
   approaches mainly operate path planning on 2D drawings or building
   layouts by simply considering geometric information, while losing
   abundant semantic information of building components. To address this
   issue, this paper introduces a new method to cope with path planning for
   3D indoor space through an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) file as
   input. As a major data exchange standard for Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), the IFC standard is capable of restoring both geometric
   information and rich semantic information of building components to
   support lifecycle data sharing. The method consists of three main steps:
   (1) extracting both geometric and semantic information of building
   components defined within the IFC file, (2) discretizing and mapping the
   extracted information into a planar grid, (3) and finally finding the
   shortest path based on the mapping for path planning using Fast Marching
   Method. The paper aims to process different kinds of building components
   and their corresponding properties to obtain rich semantic information
   that can enhance applications of path planning. In addition, the
   IFC-based distributed data sharing and management is implemented for
   path planning. The paper also presents some experiments to demonstrate
   the accuracy, efficiency and adaptability of the method. Video

Title = {An agent based environmental impact assessment of building demolition
   waste management: Conventional versus green management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {1136-1153},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great
   challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the
   limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful
   gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex
   process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have
   been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition
   waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently
   available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex
   adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the
   heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which
   has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of
   this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and
   the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence
   the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for
   evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an
   agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the
   model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building
   deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building
   destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design
   for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the
   interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd
   theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified
   into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource
   and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the
   data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal
   that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design
   are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative
   environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50\%.
   Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government
   departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental
   performance of DWM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has emerged as a transformative
   force in the construction industry, gaining traction within the
   hydropower sector. This study critically examines the adoption and
   application of BIM throughout the entire lifecycle of hydropower
   projects, addressing a notable gap in existing research, to encompass a
   holistic approach to the management and resilience of these critical
   infrastructures. The objective is to delineate the comprehensive range
   of BIM applications, use cases, and adoption, integrating technologies
   including Digital Twin, UAV, GIS, and simulation tools, across
   components of hydropower projects. Employing a systematic search paired
   with a critical review of the selected literature, this study
   meticulously evaluates significant contributions in this domain. Through
   thematic analysis, the multifaceted utility of BIM in hydropower
   structures, including an in-depth evaluation of its current adoption
   within the industry, is presented. This encompasses an analysis of both
   benefits and challenges inherent in BIM implementation for hydropower
   infrastructures. This study is a significant contribution to
   understanding how BIM can be leveraged to enhance the resilience of
   hydropower infrastructures. It provides a comprehensive view of BIM's
   applications, challenges, and future potential, guiding stakeholders in
   adopting strategies that ensure these structures withstand, adapt, and

Abstract = {Mapping websites and geo portals are playing a vital role in daily life
   due to the availability of geo-tagged data. From booking a cab to search
   a place, getting traffic information, review of the place, searching for
   a doctor or best school available in the locality, we are heavily
   dependent on the map services and geo portals available for finding such
   information. There is voluminous data available on these sources and it
   is getting increasing every moment. These data are majorly collected
   through crowdsourcing methods where people are contributing. As a basic
   principle of Garbage in garbage out, the quality of this data impacts
   the quality of the services based on this data. Therefore, it is highly
   desired to have a model which can predict the quality/accuracy of the
   geotagged Point of interest data. We propose a novel Fine-Tuned
   Predictive Model to check the accuracy of this data using the best
   suitable supervised machine learning approach. This work focuses on the
   complete life cycle of the model building, starting from the data
   collection to the fine-tuning of the hyperparameters. We covered the
   challenges particularly to the geotagged POI data and remedies to
   resolve the issues to make it suitable for predictive modeling for
   classifying the data based on their accuracy. This is a unique work that
   considers multiple sources including ground truth data to verify the
   geotagged data using a machine learning approach. After exhaustive
   experiments, we obtained the best values for hyperparameters for the
   selected predictive model built on the real data set prepared
   specifically to target the proposed solution. This work provides a way
   to develop a robust pipeline for predicting the accuracy of crowdsourced
   geotagged data.},

Title = {3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration for preservation of built
   heritage in China: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, the technical application of 3D LiDAR has gradually
   expanded to the field of built heritage. 3D scanning, high-precision
   measurement, and reconstruction have enriched the methods of built
   heritage preservation and significantly improved the quality of heritage
   preservation in China. 3D LiDAR has broken through the limitations of a
   single technology application and played a greater role in the field of
   heritage preservation on different scales. Through the collaboration of
   multi-technology, such as 3D printing, digital mapping, internet of
   things, machine learning, intelligent sensors, close-range
   photogrammetry, infrared detection, stress wave tomography, material
   analysis, XR technology, reverse engineering, etc., 3D LiDAR shows its
   technological advantages on exploring the remote real-time monitoring
   and digitization of the built heritage, geological and environmental
   data collection, prediction of sedimentation, deformation monitoring,
   weather monitoring,system life cycle health detection, digital
   reproduction of built heritage for developing scientific problems and
   engineering practices such as building contour recognition, information
   feature matching, structural reinforcement and damaged component
   replacement. In addition, through the docking with GIS, HBIM, XR, and
   CIM, it provides fine digital models and high-precision data benchmarks
   which contribute to the heritage visual reproduction; and through the
   docking with 3Ds Max, SketchUp, and other modeling software, it has
   contributed to the renewal design of the built heritage, space
   optimization, and the scientificity and rationality of the heritage
   value evaluation. However, past technology applications also highlighted
   many problems such as limited recorded information, a large amount of
   data, high difficulty in collaboration, non-standardized and fragmented
   data, and difficulty in data mining and comprehensive utilization. There
   are still deficiencies in building a built heritage data backplane, and
   the development of a dynamic, three-dimensional, intelligent and refined
   heritage monitoring system, and further research is needed on these
   issues. This study reviews the previous academic progress and
   application of 3D LiDAR in the reconstruction of built heritage and
   multi-technology collaboration in the process of preservation, clarifies
   the current research hotspots and methods, the frontier issues of
   concern, and also clarifies the specific problems and challenges in the
   future.},

Abstract = {A Building Information Model is a digital representation of physical and
   functional characteristics of a building. BIMs represent the geometrical
   characteristics of the Building, but also properties like bills of
   quantities, definition of COTS components, status of material in the
   different stages of the project, project economic data, etc.
   The BIM methodology, which is well established in the Architecture
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) domain for conventional buildings,
   has been brought one step forward in its application for
   Astronomical/Scientific facilities. In these facilities steel/concrete
   structures have high dynamic and seismic requirements, M\&E
   installations are complex and there is a large amount of special
   equipment and mechanisms involved as a fundamental part of the facility.
   The detail design definition is typically implemented by different
   design teams in specialized design software packages. In order to allow
   the coordinated work of different engineering teams, the overall model,
   and its associated engineering database, is progressively integrated
   using a coordination and roaming software which can be used before
   starting construction phase for checking interferences, planning the
   construction sequence, studying maintenance operation, reporting to the
   project office, etc.
   This integrated design \& construction approach will allow to
   efficiently plan construction sequence (4D). This is a powerful tool to
   study and analyze in detail alternative construction sequences and
   ideally coordinate the work of different construction teams.
   In addition engineering, construction and operational database can be
   linked to the virtual model (6D), what gives to the end users a
   invaluable tool for the lifecycle management, as all the facility
   information can be easily accessed, added or replaced.
   This paper presents the BIM methodology as implemented by IDOM with the
   E-ELT and ATST Enclosures as application examples.},

Title = {Site selection decision framework using fuzzy ANP-VIKOR for large
   commercial rooftop PV system based on sustainability perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {The Large Commercial Rooftop Photovoltaic System (LCRPS) projects have
   been rapidly proposed in China due to policy promotion towards
   sustainability. Site selection immensely determines the life cycle of
   LCRPS projects based on sustainability perspective, in need of
   considering the impact on environment and society. However, inadequacies
   still exist in the decision for LCRPS site selection. Firstly,
   uncertainties of information cannot be described integrally. Secondly,
   consideration of the correlation among criteria from sustainability
   perspective is lacking. Thirdly, the ranking methods in previous studies
   cannot reflect decision makers' subjective preferences. Therefore, this
   study establishes a decision framework for LCRPS site selection
   utilizing Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (Fuzzy ANP) method and Fuzzy
   Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija IKompromisno Resenje (Fuzzy VIKOR)
   method. First, the triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) are
   adopted to describe indeterminate information. Second, fuzzy ANP is
   introduced to reflect the correlation among criteria based on
   sustainability perspective. Third, fuzzy VIKOR is employed to rank the
   options on the basis of decision makers' subjective preferences.
   Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case
   study of Guangdong province with sensitive analysis and comparative
   analysis is conducted. The result shows the LCRPS site located in
   Dongguan should be selected as the optimal site.},

Abstract = {The simulation of building efficiency and cost is a crucial driver to
   contemporary building design today. This paper presents the development
   of a software tool to simulate the lifecycle costs of building
   construction and maintenance. It is a part of the nD modelling tool
   development and also based on the overall system architecture of the nD
   modelling tool. nD modelling aims to integrate a number of design
   dimensions into a holistic model, which would enable users to portray
   and visually project the building design over its complete lifecycle.
   The overall architecture of the nD modelling tool is based upon IFC
   models, which are visualized in an integrated and interactive user
   interface. Thus, this tool can inherit design information through IFC
   models, which may be converted from the design drawings generated in
   various CAD systems. This lifecycle costing tool provides users with the
   options of different building materials and constructing methods on
   individual building components. Designers can make their decisions based
   on the lifecycle cost performance of these materials and constructing
   methods. The detailed maintenance costs across the building lifecycle
   and the cost components are clearly illustrated in charts and tables.
   Some key parameters of lifecycle costing can also be modified, and the
   dynamic changes of the lifecycle costs can also be revealed in the
   charts and tables promptly. Finally, the evaluations and conclusions of
   this tool also are discussed and drawn.},

Title = {Framework of Scan to Building Information Modeling for Geometric Defect
   Localization in Railway Track Maintenance},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Railway transportation plays a vital role in modern society, enabling
   the safe and efficient movement of people and goods over long distances.
   To ensure the longevity and safety of a railway infrastructure, the
   regular maintenance of tracks is crucial. Traditional track inspections,
   conducted manually to monitor geometric parameters and to identify
   defects, are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.
   Current Scan-to-BIM frameworks for railway maintenance also lack
   standardized methods for extracting geometric parameters that can be
   easily integrated into Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   Additionally, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, used for
   BIM data exchange, does not support storing parameter values at specific
   chainage points along the track, limiting defect localization. A
   framework is proposed to address these challenges by standardizing the
   extraction of geometric parameters from point cloud data and ensuring
   seamless integration with BIM. The framework calculates parameters at
   station chainage points and generates additional chainage points along
   the track, associating the data with the corresponding chainage. A case
   study demonstrates the framework's ability to enhance defect
   localization, using the EN 13848-5 European Standard to identify defects
   at specific chainages. Ultimately, this approach contributes to the more
   effective lifecycle management of railway tracks.},

Journal = {EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING \& STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {32},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper an approach is developed for establishing optimal
   maintenance (repair) strategies of structures in seismic zones. The
   approach is based on expected future costs and the main decision
   variable is a damage threshold for repair given an acceptable
   reliability level. It is considered that structural damage accumulates
   over a number of earthquakes until a threshold is reached or exceeded,
   after which the structure is repaired so that there is no remaining
   damage. A Markov model is implemented for such a process of damage
   accumulation during future earthquakes. An algorithm is proposed for
   computing non-linear structural response to earthquakes using a damage
   function model. This algorithm is used to evaluate transition
   probabilities between damage states based on simulations of future
   earthquakes of given intensities. Expressions are derived for evaluating
   expected life-cycle damage costs and structural reliability as a
   function of time and of the damage threshold for repair. As an
   application, a single-degree-of-freedom structural system is studied. In
   addition, the paper addresses the case of instrumented structures where
   information from earthquake response records is available. Such
   information is incorporated into the formulation for maintenance
   strategies by means of a Bayesian approach for updating the probability
   distribution of structural damage and of non-linear behaviour parameters
   so that predictions about costs and reliability are improved. Copyright

Abstract = {Buildings consume a significant amount of energy throughout their
   lifecycle; Thus, sustainable energy management is crucial for all
   buildings, and controlling energy consumption has become increasingly
   important for achieving sustainable construction. Digital twin (DT)
   technology, which lies at the core of Industry 4.0, has gained
   widespread adoption in various fields, including building energy
   analysis. With the ability to monitor, optimize, and predict building
   energy consumption in real time. DT technology has enabled sustainable
   building energy management and cost reduction. This paper provides a
   comprehensive review of the development and application of DT technology
   in building energy. Specifically, it discusses the background of
   building information modeling (BIM) and DT technology and their
   application in energy optimization in buildings. Additionally, this
   article reviews the application of DT technology in building energy
   management, indoor environmental monitoring, and building energy
   efficiency evaluation. It also examines the benefits and challenges of
   implementing DT technology in building energy analysis and highlights
   recent case studies. Furthermore, this review emphasizes emerging trends
   and opportunities for future research, including integrating machine
   learning techniques with DT technology. The use of DT technology in the
   energy sector is gaining momentum as efforts to optimize energy
   efficiency and reduce carbon emissions continue. The advancement of
   building energy analysis and machine learning technologies is expected
   to enhance prediction accuracy, optimize energy efficiency, and improve
   management processes. These advancements have become the focal point of
   current literature and have the potential to facilitate the transition
   to clean energy, ultimately achieving sustainable development goals.},

Title = {Cost and environmental impacts reduction through building compactness},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1176-1195},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Purpose The central motivation for this study was to examine
   alternatives against the apartment area reduction as a safe way to
   reduce construction costs, adopted by many construction companies. From
   the building economic compactness index concept, it was studied the cost
   and environmental impacts (material consumption, embodied energy - EE
   and CO(2)emission). Design/methodology/approach The research strategy
   takes advantage of a case study aiming to investigate the relation
   between design characteristics related to area (m(2)) and building
   economic compactness index (\%) with cost (Research Stage 1) and with
   environmental impacts: (Research Stage 2). The study involved real data
   from social housing projects, chosen in terms in terms of very similar
   features like size, area and constructive method (constants), however,
   with dissimilar compactness (variable). Findings The lack of direct
   relation between area and cost signs the importance of including the
   cost of vertical plans considered in the economic compactness building.
   The higher the economic compactness index, the lower the cost, the lower
   the amount of material, EE and CO(2)emission parameters. However, due to
   the wide range of EE and CO(2)values available, the reduction in the
   amount of materials achieved by increasing building economic compactness
   index may not be reflected in EE and CO(2)gains. Research
   limitations/implications As the limitation of this study, it must be
   taken into account a limited number of case buildings and the fact that
   the analysis is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the data
   provided by constructors and the available information of EE and
   CO(2)emission. As well discussed in the literature, the consistent
   database is a great challenge for the construction sector.
   Originality/value There might be alternatives to higher areas with
   relatively low-cost increments since results from buildings with the
   same area present different cost estimative and suggest a strong
   relationship with the economic compactness index. The large variation of
   EE and CO(2)emission data indicates that reductions obtained by
   compactness increase may be impaired if the construction materials are
   produced with high levels of EE and CO(2)emission. Thus, there must be
   an integrated effort on the part of designers (design and material
   specification) and manufacturers (material production), since isolated
   solutions may not be enough.},

Abstract = {Validity of the business model is a key indicator for buying into
   ventures in the early-stage. Business models of early-stage ventures
   decrease in validity when developing the business over the progressing
   stages of the business life-cycle. By doing so, the ventures are
   validating their business model when building transaction relationships
   to the surrounding value network. In prior research, we developed a
   research design based on existing business innovation proposals
   (onepager, pitch decks, business plans) that is assumed to evaluate the
   status of business model validation. The core hypothesis of the research
   design is that transaction relations represent a strong anchor between
   the business model and the business reality, thus providing information
   on the business model validity. In this research, we test this
   hypothesis by designing and analyzing a survey that was directed to
   founders taking part in a business plan competition. We compared the
   relationships described in the submitted business plans to the relations
   explicitely stated in the follow-up questionnaire. We identified that
   the described relations to customers, investors, and people (human
   resources) match the relationships expressed in questionnaires quite
   well. A significant disagreement, however, exists in the relationships
   to suppliers. We conclude that there is still a theoretical and
   empirical gap that leads to disagreement between business plans and
   reality in the group of suppliers.},

Title = {Use of engineered nanomaterials in the construction industry with
   specific emphasis on paints and their flows in construction and
   demolition waste in Switzerland},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {398-406},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One sector where the use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is supposed
   to offer novel or improved functionalities is the construction industry.
   During the renovation or demolition of buildings, ENMs contained in
   former construction materials will enter recycling systems or become
   construction waste. Currently, information about ENM flows in these
   processes is insufficient. The potential for the release of ENMs from
   this waste into the environment is unknown, as are the environmental
   impacts. To evaluate whether there is currently any nano-relevant
   construction and demolition waste (C\&DW) originating from buildings, we
   evaluated the sources and flows of ENMs in C\&DW and identified their
   potential exposure pathways. A survey of business representatives of
   Swiss companies in this sector found that ENMs are mainly used in paints
   and cement. The most frequently used ENMs in the Swiss housing
   construction industry are nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2, nano-ZnO, and nano-Ag.
   Using a bottom-up, semi-quantitative approach, we estimated the flows of
   ENMs contained in paints along the product's life cycle from buildings
   to recycling and landfill. The flows of ENMs are determined by their
   associated flows of building materials. We estimated an annual amount of
   ENMs used in paints of 14 t of TiO2, 12 t of SiO2, 5 t of ZnO, and 0.2 t
   of Ag. The majority of ENMs contained in paints in Switzerland enter
   recycling systems (23 t/y), a smaller amount is disposed directly in
   landfills (7 t/y), and a tiny fraction of ENM waste is incinerated (0.01
   t/y). Our results allow a qualitative determination of the potential
   release of ENMs into technical or environmental compartments, with the
   highest potential release expected during recycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Since several years, the concept of the ``Smart City{''} has been
   meeting a large concern throughout the world. Through smart city
   implementation, cities aim at improving the efficiency and security of
   their urban infrastructures as well as the quality of life of citizens.
   The Smart City concept is based on collection and analysis of data
   concerning the urban built environment (buildings and infrastructures)
   as well as the natural environment and urban services. Since built
   environment plays a major role in the city functioning and the quality
   of services, a smart city project should integrate this environment in
   the heart of its strategy. This integration requires first the
   development of digital modelling for the City, urban infrastructures and
   buildings. The digital modeling should include the asset data, the
   operating data and the environmental data all over the lifecycle of
   concerned systems. It should also guarantee the interoperability between
   the different modelling tools. This paper presents a synthesis of min
   tools used for modelling the City, urban infrastructures and buildings
   and discusses their interoperability.},

Title = {Enablers for facilitating life cycle assessment: key stakeholder
   perspectives of Sri Lankan construction industry},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the desire to improve the sustainability of the
   construction industry, Sri Lanka is still plagued by the low-level
   adoption of essential methods such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in
   building and infrastructure delivery. It is indispensable to investigate
   enablers for facilitating LCA because identification of enablers is a
   crucial step in the implementation of LCA. This study aims to analyze
   internal and external enablers for facilitating LCA for the Sri Lankan
   construction industry from the perspective of five stakeholder
   categories (academia, government, construction industry, society and
   environmentalists) and also aims to develop strategies to strengthen the
   enablers. Design/methodology/approach An explanatory research design was
   used. The five stakeholder categories identified above, whose
   contribution is essential for implementing LCA in Sri Lanka, were
   selected for data collection. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews
   were held representing each stakeholder category. The Repertory Grid
   Interview (RGI) technique was utilized and data analysis was performed
   using content analysis. Findings The results revealed that ``ability to
   identify opportunities for environmental improvements as an extremely
   important internal enabler for all stakeholder categories{''} and ``the
   positive growth in the country to achieve environmental
   sustainability{''}, ``the availability of standardized LCA guides and
   handbooks{''} as extremely important external enablers for all
   stakeholder categories for facilitating LCA in the Sri Lankan
   construction industry. Further, strategies including making people aware
   of the LCA concept and development of the LCA database, etc. were
   proposed to strengthen the enablers. Practical implications Knowledge
   generated through this study would enable the abovementioned
   stakeholders to make informed decisions to promote the implementation of
   LCA in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further, the results of
   this study have raised awareness of the issues that Sri Lanka will need
   to solve to expand the LCA applications. Originality/value So far,
   research on LCA has not looked into enablers that can facilitate the
   implementation of LCA in the Sri Lankan construction industry. This
   research provides a comprehensive view of the internal and external
   enablers for facilitating LCA from the perspective of five stakeholder
   categories and identifies enablers that led the abovementioned
   stakeholders to pursue the implementation of LCA in the Sri Lankan
   construction industry. The study also proposes strategies for
   strengthening the enablers.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In order to understand how changes in individual performance (growth,
   survival or reproduction) influence population dynamics and evolution,
   ecologists are increasingly using parameterized mathematical models.
   For continuously structured populations, where some continuous measure
   of individual state influences growth, survival or reproduction,
   integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used.
   We provide a detailed description of the steps involved in constructing
   an IPM, explaining how to: (i) translate your study system into an IPM;
   (ii) implement your IPM; and (iii) diagnose potential problems with your
   IPM. We emphasize how the study organism's life cycle, and the timing of
   censuses, together determine the structure of the IPM kernel and
   important aspects of the statistical analysis used to parameterize an
   IPM using data on marked individuals.
   An IPM based on population studies of Soay sheep is used to illustrate
   the complete process of constructing, implementing and evaluating an IPM
   fitted to sample data.
   We then look at very general approaches to parameterizing an IPM, using
   a wide range of statistical techniques (e.g. maximum likelihood methods,
   generalized additive models, nonparametric kernel density estimators).
   Methods for selecting models for parameterizing IPMs are briefly
   discussed.
   We conclude with key recommendations and a brief overview of
   applications that extend the basic model. The online Supporting
   Information provides commented R code for all our analyses.},

Abstract = {Technological developments of the last decades are making possible to
   speed up different processes involved in construction projects. It is
   noticeable what building information modeling (BIM) can offer during the
   entire lifecycle of a project by integrating graphical and non graphical
   data, in addition to this, mapping the site with a 3D laser scan has
   been proved to provide a feasible workflow to compare as built models
   with as designed BIM, in this way, an automatic construction progress
   monitoring can also be performed. Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) are
   commonly used to map a construction site due the level of accuracy
   provided, but indoor mobile mapping systems (iMMS) could offer a more
   efficient approach by speeding up the acquisition time and capturing all
   the details of the site just by walking through it, provided that the
   point cloud is accurate enough for the purpose of interest. In this
   paper, an iMMS is used to track the progress of a construction site, the
   point clouds were uploaded onto a platform of autonomous construction
   progress monitoring to verify if the system can meet the requirements of
   available applications. The results showed that the iMMS used is capable
   to produce point clouds with a quality such that the construction
   progress monitoring can be performed.},

Abstract = {Dealing with and maintaining high-quality standards in the design and
   construction phases is challenging, especially for on-site construction.
   Issues like improper implementation of building components and poor
   communication can widen the gap between design specifications and actual
   conditions. To prevent this, particularly for energy-efficient
   buildings, it is vital to develop resilient, sustainable strategies.
   These should optimize resource use, minimize environmental impact, and
   enhance livability, contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and
   climate change mitigation. Traditional post-occupancy evaluations, which
   identify defects after construction, are impractical for addressing
   energy performance gaps. A new, real-time inspection approach is
   necessary throughout the construction process. This paper suggests an
   innovative guideline for prefabricated buildings, emphasizing digital
   `self-instruction' and `self-inspection'. These procedures ensure
   activities impacting quality adhere to specific instructions, drawings,
   and 3D models, incorporating the relevant acceptance criteria to verify
   completion. This methodology, promoting alignment with planned
   energy-efficient features, is supported by BIM-based software and
   Augmented Reality (AR) tools, embodying Industry 4.0 principles. BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) and AR bridge the gap between virtual
   design and actual construction, improving stakeholder communication and
   enabling real-time monitoring and adjustments. This integration fosters
   accuracy and efficiency, which are key for energy-efficient and nearly
   zero-energy buildings, marking a shift towards a more precise,
   collaborative, and environmentally sensible construction industry.},

Abstract = {In urban areas, the ``built{''} is defined by many different elements.
   Not only buildings but also open spaces containing green areas,
   viability, urban furniture, underground facilities. While the H-BIM
   sector focuses, rightly, on buildings of great historical significance,
   in our case it is been consider a part of the built that it usually not
   analyse: the urban open space. One of the interesting themes is the
   possibility of having a single tool that integrates the different
   objects present in a complex environment such as the urban area. The
   process with BIM model could allow a huge saving in terms of time and
   costs considering public tender, maintenance or construction phase of a
   project. Facility management operating through BIM is another relevant
   theme considering the whole life of a construction. Finally, another
   important theme is the connections between elements above the ground
   (visible elements) and subsoil (not visible elements), not only for the
   administrations but also if related to the HBIM environment.
   The paper reports the analysis of the experience performed, particularly
   related to questions about detail and accuracy of the BIM model.
   A methodology for modelling open spaces is been assuming, it is
   described possible improvements and considerations on the result.},

Abstract = {In Slovakia, the Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology is no
   more taken as only a breakthrough technology for building industry
   development. It is increasingly considered as inevitability throughout
   all building project lifecycle. Therefore, there is an expanding trend
   of new positions in construction companies like BIM managers and BIM
   coordinators. Hence, BIM education and development of BIM knowledge and
   skills should play a significant role in engineering studies. In other
   words, educational institutes play a key role in preparing the graduates
   with the required skills needed for BIM tasks and solutions. The BIM
   skills and competencies as a topic is of expanding interest and various
   universities in the world over are currently being undertaken for
   effective and active integration with engineering studies. Likewise,
   integrating the BIM knowledge and skills into conventional teaching at
   the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Kosice - Slovakia, reflects the
   demands of the construction enterprises for high quality both technical
   and application skilled engineers. The submitted paper focuses on
   introducing and explaining the currently ongoing educational project
   aimed at developing and supporting BIM skills of students in the Faculty
   of Civil Engineering in Kosice - Slovakia. The objectives and goals of
   the presented and discussed project are oriented on better understanding
   of BIM skills requirements for the construction sector and on assisting
   in implementing the BIM skills-oriented topics in the educational
   curricula in the faculty. Various encouraging and incentive activities
   included in the educational project and methods and practices of their
   performance are described in the paper. Moreover, all intended
   realization outcomes of the project are mentioned and characterised and
   a proposal of the procedure to achieve tangible and intangible goals of
   the project is presented.},

   written in a natural language because informal specifications Cannot be

   Quantitative measures on its maintainability can then be extracted from
   such a formal specification, so that we can develop easily maintainable
   communication software systems and further reduce the increasingly high
   cost of software maintenance. To date, there is hardly any work done on
   measuring the maintainability of a system early in its specification,
   phase. This paper presents a method for measuring the maintainability of
   a communication by using maintainability metrics derived from its formal
   specification written in Estelle. The methodology, for building the
   Estelle maintainability metrics hierarchy-is presented. We have also
   developed an automated tool, called PSAMS, to automate the calculation
   of the maintainability indices. We also found that there is a
   significant correlation between the specification metrics proposed and
   the widely adopted implementation metrics, thus demonstrating that our
   proposed metrics are a reliable means of measuring the maintainability
   of a communication protocol early in the specification phase.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Innovative approaches to supervising over the life cycle
   of construction projects at the stages of engineering surveys and design
   works, underground and earthworks, construction of building
   superstructures and further operation and maintenance using UAVs and
   special software give the Ukraine construction sector companies a unique
   chance to realize their potential during the digital revolution and take
   their rightful place among the world leaders.
   Problem statement. Due to the lack of actual, accurate data and
   indicators which describe the status of the construction site, building
   corporations face such problems as the lack of up-to-date information on
   the project implementation progress, late detection of delays in the
   progress of works from the original works program, uncontrolled human
   factor effect on checking the quantities and quality of works performed
   by contractors, insufficient communication between project stakeholders.
   Subsequently, these factors lead to an increase in the budget and
   extension of works time.
   Purpose. To implement innovative approaches to supervision over
   infrastructure construction projects.
   Materials and Methods. Applied research using UAV DJI Phantom 4 PRO,
   software DroneDeploy, FWD, and Virtual Surveyor as part of supervising
   over the implementation of for solid waste landfill rehabilitation
   project in Pidhirtsi, Obukhiv District, Kyiv Oblast.
   Results. Based on the data obtained using UAVs, orthophotomaps and
   topographical map of the area with a constantly varying surface have
   been built. With the help of the mentioned maps, the parameters and
   characteristics of the construction project have been analyzed for
   making decisions at different stage of the project implementation.
   Conclusions. UAVs have proved themselves to be an efficient monitoring
   and supervision tool for organizing and managing the solid waste
   landfill rehabilitation project.},

   interruption to clinical activities and maintaining patient safety.
   Their tasks are complicated by fragmented and sometimes incomplete
   information. To help facility managers better manage lifecycle
   information pertinent to managing the facility and responding to
   facility related patient safety events, an object oriented product model
   is proposed in the context of developing a healthcare facility
   information management framework. The product model is developed as a
   result of various case analyses that were conducted using Unified
   Modeling Language (UML) Use Cases to examine information needs for
   existing healthcare facility maintenance operations. The resulting
   classification system and its uses to respond to patient safety events
   are discussed in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Small-scale decentralised water and power cogeneration systems with
   hybrid renewable and fossil power and process heat supply must not only
   exhibit a technically sound design, but the chosen configuration must
   also be economically viable. The availability of competing technical
   solutions to generate the commodities drinking water and electricity in
   combination with the uncertainty related with the prediction of future
   scenarios necessitates the transparent and computer-aided comparison of
   different options. This paper describes the basic features of the
   simulation environment IPSEpro and how it was adapted to allow for the
   specific needs of feasibility assessment studies on de-central water and
   power supply integrating renewable energy in MENA countries. IPSEpro is
   an open framework for process modelling and consists out of several
   modules for specific purposes. The basic modules are the Process
   Simulation Environment (PSE) and the Model Development Kit (MDK). They
   are used for building and solving process models and for defining new
   component models, respectively. PSEconomy is an extension module for the
   techno-economic analysis of processes and allows detailed evaluation of
   life cycle cost for different technical process configurations under
   varying economic scenarios. The process specific technical and economic
   details are contained in so-called model libraries which are created and
   extended with MDK. With this approach it is possible for end-users to
   develop very detailed but still adaptable solutions without the need to
   get into time-consuming high-level programming. The special model
   library RESYSproDESAL covers a wide range of technologies for energy
   conversion and sea- and brackish water desalination with emphasis on
   energy supply from renewable sources. Cost data are allocated to system
   components contained in the library as functions of size and capacity.
   They are based on market information, and cost parameters as well as
   functional relationships can be updated at any time. The economic
   assessment is performed through a complete through-life cycle cost
   analysis, which includes the total capital cost of the plant, the cost
   of fuel, O\&M costs and the expected revenues from the sale of power and
   water at different operating conditions. Varying economic scenarios,
   including anticipated inflation and fluctuations in fuel prices and
   product revenues, can be taken into account. PSEconomy generates
   different profitability measures like net present value (NPV), internal
   rate of return (IRR) and product through-life costs, which can be used
   for economic assessment. The capabilities of the software are
   illustrated by an exemplary case study based on RESYSproDESAL models.},

Title = {Ontology for BIM-Based Robotic Navigation and Inspection Tasks},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The availability of inspection robots in the construction and operation
   phases of buildings has led to expanding the scope of applications and
   increasing technological challenges. Furthermore, the building
   information modeling (BIM)-based approach for robotic inspection is
   expected to improve the inspection process as the BIM models contain
   accurate geometry and relevant information at different phases of the
   lifecycle of a building. Several studies have used BIM for navigation
   purposes. Also, some studies focused on developing a knowledge-based
   ontology to perform activities in a robotic environment (e.g., CRAM).
   However, the research in this area is still limited and fragmented, and
   there is a need to develop an integrated ontology to be used as a first
   step towards logic-based inspection. This paper aims to develop an
   ontology for BIM-based robotic navigation and inspection tasks (OBRNIT).
   This ontology can help system engineers involved in developing robotic
   inspection systems by identifying the different concepts and
   relationships between robotic inspection and navigation tasks based on
   BIM information. The developed ontology covers four main types of
   concepts: (1) robot concepts, (2) building concepts, (3) navigation task
   concepts, and (4) inspection task concepts. The ontology is developed
   using Prot \& eacute;g \& eacute;. The following steps are taken to
   reach the objectives: (1) the available literature is reviewed to
   identify the concepts, (2) the steps for developing OBRNIT are
   identified, (3) the basic components of the ontology are developed, and
   (4) the evaluation process is performed for the developed ontology. The
   semantic representation of OBRNIT was evaluated through a case study and
   a survey. The evaluation confirms that OBRNIT covers the domain's
   concepts and relationships, and can be applied to develop robotic
   inspection systems. In a case study conducted in a building at Concordia
   University, OBRNIT was used to support an inspection robot in navigating
   to identify a ceiling leakage. Survey results from 33 experts indicate
   that 28.13\% strongly agreed and 65.63\% agreed on the usage of OBRNIT
   for the development of robotic navigation and inspection systems. This
   highlights its potential in enhancing inspection reliability and
   repeatability, addressing the complexity of interactions within the
   inspection environment, and supporting the development of more
   autonomous and efficient robotic inspection systems.},

Abstract = {With the emergence of vast technological advancements in the
   construction industry to address construction issues, BIM is foreseen as
   a potential utilization environment. To expand BIM performance in
   addressing contemporary construction issues, there is currently an
   uprising trend of plugin development. This paper reports a systematic
   review of BIM-based plugins, by exploring their nature, areas of
   application, and their implication on productivity and efficiency. Using
   a systematic review approach, the study narrows down vast literature and
   critically analyses 34 developed plugins from 34 different articles.
   Findings suggest that custom-build plugins are excelling in vast areas
   utilizing key construction processes like automation, including Health
   and Safety and Lifecycle assessments, as they are proven to drive
   productivity and efficiency towards cost and time savings as well as
   error minimization. Moreover, based on the commonalities between the
   extracted plugin systems, a framework that could facilitate a better
   understanding of the programming dynamics in developing BIM-based
   plugins is presented. Value: This paper offers future research of the
   insights needed to better understand the directions of BIM-based plugin
   development and captures BIM evolvement towards more problem-solving
   potentials.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the critical challenge of data validation in the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, arising from
   the interoperability issues linked with Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standards. Despite the
   potential of IFC in improving project lifecycle management, the accuracy
   and reliability of BIM data remain hindered by insufficient validation
   tools. The paper proposes a novel approach employing deep graph
   convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) to validate and correct IFC model
   properties, leveraging 3D model element segmentation. This methodology
   aims to enhance data reliability, facilitating improved interoperability
   within the AEC sector. By examining the feasibility of neural networks
   for property validation and by converting neural network results into
   actionable model element properties, the research contributes to
   advancing BIM environments towards greater accuracy and efficiency. The
   implications of this study extend to improving project delivery times,
   reducing costs, and enhancing collaboration among stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Sustainable treatments of construction and demolition (C\&D) wastes have
   become an increasingly urgent social, environmental, and economic issue
   worldwide. Based on a filter of 370 articles related to C\&D waste
   management, this review-based study adopted a science mapping approach
   to evaluating the recent decade's C\&D waste management research.
   Through a three-step workflow consisting of bibliometric literature
   search, scientometric analysis, and qualitative discussion, this study
   identified the most influential journals, scholars, articles, and
   countries that have been active and influential in the C\&D waste
   management research since 2009. Keyword analysis revealed the emerging
   research topics, such as BIM, prefabricated construction, Big Data, and
   Circular Economy. The follow-up discussion summarized the mainstream
   research areas (e.g., qualification of waste generation), discussed
   research gaps (e.g., integration of BIM and Big Data into C\&D waste
   management), and proposed the framework for near-future research, such
   as a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of C\&D waste
   diversion, human factors, and design and planning for waste diversion.
   By providing the big picture of the latest research in C\&D waste
   management since 2009, the paper serves as a multi-disciplinary guide

Title = {Parametric modelling and evolutionary optimization for cost-optimal and
   low-carbon design of high-rise reinforced concrete buildings},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Design optimization of reinforced concrete structures helps reducing the
   global carbon emissions and the construction cost in buildings. Previous
   studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural
   elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings
   have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of
   resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully
   explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the
   optimization of individual structural elements and the topological
   arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls
   for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a
   novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of
   high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the
   structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric
   modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual
   structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A
   novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is
   proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing
   the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member
   sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete
   building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which
   can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify
   the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material
   cost are both reduced by 18-24\% after performing optimization. The

Title = {A Computing Model for Lifecycle Health Performance Evaluations of
   Sustainable Healthy Buildings},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {As hazardous substances generated indoors are becoming a greater social
   issue, sustainable healthy buildings are being increasingly spotlighted.
   Sustainable healthy buildings refer to those buildings that maintain a
   certain level of health performance for their lifecycle. The health
   performance can be evaluated in terms of time, space and health factors.
   Previous studies on healthy buildings have mostly focused on pollutant
   emissions from materials and evaluation indicators, and the studies
   conducted on performance evaluations have been limited to specific areas
   such as indoor air quality (IAQ). However, it is necessary to assess the
   lifecycle health performance of health factors including IAQ,
   temperature, humidity, noise and lighting. In addition, a computing
   model is required to easily and promptly calculate the health factors
   and share health performance evaluation results during the planning,
   design, construction and operation and maintenance (O \& M) phases. The
   purpose of this study is to propose a computing model for lifecycle
   health performance evaluation (LHPE model) of sustainable healthy
   buildings. The LHPE model consists of a lifecycle health performance
   tree (LHT) model, a process model and an information model. The LHPE
   model is intended to be used as a tool to draw out the comprehensive
   health performance of buildings with ease and quickness, when the
   evaluation indicators of the factors are completed in the near future.},

Title = {BIM-based method to inform operation and maintenance phases through a
   simplified procedure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The use of BIM in the architecture, engineering, construction and
   operation (AECO) industry is becoming increasingly widespread.
   Nevertheless, interoperability with Computerized Mainte-nance Management
   Systems (CMMS) remains a significant challenge in the domain.
   Furthermore, available applications require high expertise to correctly
   implement the data export, don't allow incremental database updates and
   are overall non-cost-effective, moreover in the case of small and
   medium-sized structures. At the same time, given the need to invest in a
   more sustainable built environment, it is necessary to consider the
   whole lifecycle of constructions, including the operation and
   maintenance phase, while designing. In the framework of this scenario,
   the paper presents a research work which defines a method to implement
   interoperability between BIM and CMMS software by using the IFC open
   standard, to allow an easier management of buildings, from design to
   decommissioning. This method, devised to be as feasible as possible,
   combines an operational procedure and a practical tool. The work was
   supported by the software house Prometeo Srl and the Facility Management
   company GEMMO SpA. The method was developed based on the Feltre Hospital
   (Italy) and results, that were technically validated through an ad hoc
   BIM model, can be used by other practitioners to further implement the
   method in other research.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {785-807},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel and systematic
   framework for bridge inspection and management to improve the efficiency
   in current practice. Design/methodology/approach A new framework that
   implements camera-based unmanned aerial systems (UASs) with computer
   vision algorithms to collect and process inspection data, and Bridge
   Information Modeling (BrIM) to store and manage all related inspection
   information is proposed. An illustrative case study was performed using
   the proposed framework to test its feasibility and efficiency. Findings
   The test results of the proposed framework on an existing bridge
   verified that: high-resolution images captured by an UAS enable to
   visually identify different types of defects, and detect cracks
   automatically using computer vision algorithms, the use of BrIM enable
   assigning defect information on individual model elements, manage all
   bridge data in a single model across the bridge life cycle. The
   evaluation by bridge inspectors from 12 states across the USA
   demonstrated that all of the identified problems, except for being
   subjective, can be improved using the proposed framework. Practical
   implications - The proposed framework enables to: collect and document
   accurate bridge inspection data, reduce the number of site visits and
   avoid data overload and facilitate a more efficient, cost-effective and
   safer bridge inspection process. Originality/value This paper
   contributes a novel and systematic framework for the collection and
   integration of inspection data for bridge inspection and management. The
   findings from the case study suggest that the proposed framework should
   help improve current bridge inspection and management practice.
   Furthermore, the difficulties experienced during the implementation are
   evaluated, which should be helpful for improving the efficiency and the
   degree of automation of the proposed framework further.},

Abstract = {Software complexity estimation is an important activity to software
   development life-cycle such as in terms of effort, cost and size. A lot
   of estimation models were proposed in the literature but they do not
   consider the new paradigm shift in software development service-oriented
   architecture (SOA). SOA is a new style of software architecture that has
   six principles like standard interface (contract) which allows building
   technology-independent applications that can interoperate. Function
   Point (FP) metrics were designed to consider functional requirements
   (complexity) instead of lines of code, which is enriched by Use Case
   Point (UCP), a software estimation technique proposed to estimate the
   software size and effort for software development projects of
   object-oriented systems. However, estimation techniques for
   Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are still not investigated well.
   Generally the demanded is having global view by relating function point
   methods with SOA design principles so this is an attempt to provide this
   view. As UML use case and activity models are widely recognized for its
   easy of communication, this paper has adopted them for estimating
   service-based systems complexity as a source of information for system
   under estimation in high level models. The proposed technique is
   compatible to the design principles of SOA and provides a systematic and
   formal way for complexity estimation. Courseware management
   service-based system is used as case study to evaluate the proposed
   technique.},

Title = {Revival of the system of consumer cooperation in Russia; sustainable

Abstract = {The system of consumer cooperation has a certain potential in solving
   national problems related to the provision of employment and the quality
   of life of the population, as well as to the social reorganization of
   the village. The study shows that the cooperative system is
   characterized by the complementarity of traits (social and economic),
   the dialectical interaction of which serves as the basis for the
   formation of civil society (self-organization and voluntary cooperation
   of shareholders in the process of production and economic activity) and
   a peculiar locomotive of the evolution of society towards building
   socially-oriented market economy (non-commercial nature of activities
   and humanistic values). However, the emerging trend of losing the
   competitive positions of the consumer cooperative system in the regional
   consumer markets in Russia leads to an awareness of the need for
   institutional changes that would make it possible to fully utilize the
   economic and social potential of the development of consumer cooperation
   in the context of the structural transformation of Russian society. The
   authors offer practical recommendations on the design and formation of
   effective forms of management of economic entities in the cooperative
   sector. Complex nature of the economic resource requires its inclusion
   in the correlation algorithm of proactive management. Simulation of
   sustainable innovation development of the regional system of consumer
   cooperation is possible only using optimization-qualimetric modeling on
   the platform of the software product. Computer technologies create
   objective opportunities for creating the required model. The integrated
   computer space is able to rework the network of mathematical matrices,
   building a complete life cycle of an economic resource, consisting not
   only of collecting and analyzing information, but also the possibility
   of making operational management decisions.},

   construction: Current status and future perspectives},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is
   experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation
   and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology
   and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM),
   machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention
   owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven
   underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation
   as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are
   valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and
   maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the
   processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of
   BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction
   represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use
   in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the
   state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning,
   computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the
   digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1
   presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2
   introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals.
   Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and
   highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and
   geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4
   examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at
   different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the
   challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these
   emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and
   information integration throughout underground project lifecycle.
   Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps
   and future directions.},

Abstract = {In the CR (Czech Republic), there are a lot of prefabricated housing
   estates built in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century, which are at the
   end of their life cycle. The main goal of the project was to evaluate
   the rate of energy savings in the long term due to the revitalization of
   prefabricated apartment buildings, and thus provide feedback to the
   relevant authorities on its effectiveness. Another goal was to evaluate
   selected parameters of living comfort in the locality for the purposes
   of the real estate market with the possibility of providing them to
   those interested in living in the locality. A complex of methods was
   used, which evaluate criteria from various spheres, such as environment,
   spatial relationships, social aspects, etc. The authors used a
   combination of multi-criterial analysis methods (MCA) and spatial
   analysis within a Geographical Information System (GIS). Of all MCA
   methods, weighted linear combination (WLC) was chosen as the most
   suitable. In the spatial analyses, the matter of solution was, above
   all, the distance to the center and the transport within the given
   locality. The above-mentioned methods served as a model for evaluating
   whether a panel house in question is or is not suitable for
   reconstruction. The input data of the model are spatial data-national
   map series of the CR, environmental data (noise maps, energy demands of
   buildings)-and statistical data obtained from various sources (city
   administration of Brno, relevant organizations, and interviews with
   respondents). Within Inquiry Form 3, potential groups of respondents
   were addressed: Group A-people over fifty, group B-young families with
   children, group C-students under 25. The projected model was tested in
   Brno city in the locality of Novy Liskovec (CR). The proposed model
   provided information on the quality of housing in a given locality in
   terms of energy intensity, noise pollution, transport accessibility, and
   civic amenities. The output is a multi-criteria model with GIS support,
   which is generally applicable. The results of the model analyses led to
   the demonstration of the effectiveness of revitalization. The results
   can be used for estate offices or other organizations in the form of
   graphical outputs of appropriate variants on the basis of solving a lot
   of criteria when searching for a suitable residence.},

Title = {DYNAMIC SIMULATION MODEL OF CENTRAL AMERICAN LOCUST <i>SCHISTOCERCA

Abstract = {Locusts, large gregarious and migratory grasshoppers, are pests of
   economic importance in several regions of the world because of the
   severe damage they can cause to crops. The Central American locust,
   Schistocerca piceifrons is the most important locust species in the
   Americas, and it is distributed in zones of Mexico, Central and South
   America. In Mexico, despite the efforts to survey and monitor S.
   piceifrons (Walker) populations, outbreaks are still difficult to
   predict and prevent, and high economic and ecological costs are incurred
   in controlling them. The purpose of this study was to build a dynamic
   model of locust growth and development as a function of environmental
   conditions in order to identify suitable conditions for the high
   reproduction rates of this insect. This information can be used to
   assist in locust management. A modular approach and numerical
   integration techniques were applied in model building. The main inputs
   of the model were daily rainfall and temperature data, and physical soil
   properties such as texture and depth. The model estimates the growth of
   non-cultivated grass in breeding zones and oviposition rates as a
   function of soil moisture. The development rates of the different locust
   stages are calculated as a function of temperature. The model
   satisfactorily represents S. piceifrons behaviour, and generates 2
   generations per yr, the first in summer and the second in winter. In
   locations with suboptimal temperatures the second generation does not
   complete development until the next year. A good agreement was found
   between model outputs and field data from Yucatan, Mexico for 2008 to
   2010. Based on these results the model is proposed for use as a tool to
   support S. piceifrons monitoring by the National Locust Control Program.},

Abstract = {BIM tools enable decision-making during the lifecycle of engineering
   structures, such as bridges, tunnels, and roads. National Road
   Authorities use Asset Management Systems (AMS) to manage and monitor
   operational information of assets from European Highways, including
   access to sensor and inspection data. Interoperability between BIM and
   AMS systems is vital for a timely and effective decision-making process
   during the operational phase of these assets. The European project
   Connected Data for Effective Collaboration (CoDEC) designed a framework
   to support the connections between AMS and BIM platforms, using linked
   data principles. The CoDEC Data Dictionary was developed to provide
   standard data formats for AMS used by European NRA. This paper presents
   the design and development of an Engineering Structures ontology used to
   encode the shared conceptualization provided by the CoDEC Data
   Dictionary. The ontology is evaluated, validated, and demonstrated as a
   base for data exchange between BIM and AMS.},

Title = {Modeling simple trigeneration systems for the distribution of
   environmental loads},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {71-80},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Integration of thermoeconomics and Life Cycle Analysis was carried out
   within the framework of an Environmental Management Information System.
   This combined approach identified where environmental loads were
   generated and tracked environmental loads throughout the system,
   allowing for a more precise understanding of operational activities. A
   trigeneration system was modeled, providing electricity, heat, and
   cooling to a building. The trigeneration system consists of a
   cogeneration module, auxiliary boiler, absorption chiller and electrical
   chiller. The trigeneration system model is flexible, as it allows
   electricity from/to the electric grid to be purchased/sold, and part of
   the cogenerated heat to be wasted. Umberto software is specifically
   designed to analyze the distribution of material and energy resources
   throughout a productive system. The software is based on Petri networks,
   double-entry bookkeeping and cost accounting, allowing the setup of
   complex systems and also a combined material, energy and inventory
   calculation. An assistant was built to include the tracking of emissions
   through the application of algebra and rules similar to those used in
   thermoeconomic analysis. It is possible to evaluate the environmental
   impact in terms of the consumption of natural resources and generation
   of emissions in the system, from the input of natural resources to the
   output of the final products. Network parameters were used to calculate
   the emissions associated with the operation of the system. The issue of
   allocating environmental loads was introduced and two scenarios for each
   operational mode were compared: the trigeneration system vs. a
   conventional energy supply system in which electricity was produced in a
   representative coal power plant. In this case the trigeneration system
   operated with significant reduction of the CO2 emitted into the
   atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Light rail transit cost performance: Opportunities for future-proofing},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {27-39},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The cost performance of Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems have been
   scrutinized by the popular press and public sector infrastructure
   agencies as they have been prone to incurring cost increases in their
   capital expenditures (CAPEX). In tackling such increases, emphasis is
   placed on mitigating strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias,
   which has hindered the public sectors ability to embrace innovation,
   particularly with regard to the justification and adoption of LRT. More
   often than not, operational expenditure (OPEX) is neglected, and is not
   considered a part of the transportation cost performance literature. The
   aim of this paper is to examine the equivocality that surrounds the
   determination of cost performance of LRT projects. It is suggested that
   the public sector should move beyond focusing on strategic
   misrepresentation and optimism bias, as many governments worldwide now
   have in place mechanisms to address such issues, and instead focus on
   future-proofing their assets. It is suggested that the key enablers of
   future-proofing LRT are (1) private finance; (2) delivery strategy (e.g.
   design-build-finance-operate); (3) digitization (e.g. building
   information modelling); and (4) asset management (e.g. smart
   technologies). If the public sector is to provide an LRT system that is
   cost effective and able to respond to the demands imposed by climate
   change, then it needs to be considered from a life cycle perspective and
   funding sought from the private sector to ensure its viability. (C) 2017

Title = {The characteristics and evolution of business model for green buildings:
   a bibliometric approach},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {10},
Pages = {4241-4266},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Purpose The wide uptake of green building is hindered by factors such as
   limited market demand and high up-front cost despite substantial policy
   incentives. Successful business models (BMs) help facilitate the
   diffusion of sustainable innovation and have attracted increasing
   attention. However, little attention has been paid to examining the
   adoption of green building from the perspective of BM. This paper aims
   to identify the characteristics of BM that companies adopted to deliver
   green building projects and examine the evolution path of BM for green
   buildings. Design/methodology/approach A total of 744 interdisciplinary
   bibliographic records related to BM and green buildings from the Web of
   Science Core Collection database have been identified from the Web of
   Science Core Collection and analyzed through co-author analysis, co-word
   analysis and co-citation analysis. Findings BM research mainly focuses
   on five subjects, namely, environmental science, engineering, business,
   economics, science and technology. Keywords ``strategy{''},
   ``capability{''}, ``perspective{''} and ``design{''} receive the highest
   centrality index, which suggests that the strategy design and corporate
   capability are indispensable elements when designing or innovating a
   company's BM. ``BM canvas{''} and ``resource based view{''} received the
   burst citations in the recent decade. Twelve research clusters are
   identified, including performance evaluation, waste management, energy
   efficiency, BM, project business, professional capital, leadership and
   product innovation. These topics highlight three evolution direction for
   green building projects, i.e. life cycle-oriented value proposition,
   collaborative value delivery and innovative cost and revenue structure.
   Originality/value The findings contribute to a systematic understanding
   of the underlying mechanisms of BM for green buildings and illuminate
   the development trend of business strategies for sustainability.},

Abstract = {Current practices and integration trends in the
   architectural/engineering/construction (A/E/C) industry are increasing
   the demands for the implementation and deployment of integrated project
   systems. Much of the research throughout the last decade was driven by
   the need to develop integrated project systems and standard
   industry-wide data models to support their development. This paper
   presents a multitier component-based framework that aims to facilitate
   the implementation of modular and distributed integrated project systems
   that would support multidisciplinary project processes throughout the
   project life cycle. The framework addresses the specific requirements of
   A/E/C projects, and highlights the required functionality and approach
   to develop integrated project systems. The framework defines a
   three-tier architecture: Applications tier, common domain-services tier,
   and project data-repository tier. The applications tier includes a set
   of function-specific software tools that interact with the
   domain-services-tier components via a set of adapters. Adapters map the
   applications' internal proprietary-data models to and from a standard
   integrated data model. The domain-services-tier components implement a
   number of generic services, such as data management, transactions
   management, document management, and workflow management. The
   data-repository tier represents a centralized shared storage of all
   relevant project information. The paper also discusses the
   implementation of a prototype software system that demonstrates the use
   of the framework's reusable components and the industry foundation
   classes data model in typical building projects.},

Title = {Generation Method for HVAC Systems Design Schemes in Office Buildings
   Based on Deep Graph Generative Models},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The design process of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
   systems is complex and time consuming due to the need to follow design
   codes. Since the design standards are not fixed, the final outcome often
   depends on the designer's experience. The development of building
   information modeling (BIM) technology has made information throughout
   the building lifecycle more integrated. BIM-based forward design is now
   widely used, providing a data foundation for combining HVAC system
   design with machine learning. This paper proposes an unsupervised
   learning method based on deep graph generative models to uncover hidden
   design patterns and optimization strategies from the design results. We
   trained and validated four deep graph generative models-GAE, GNF, GAN,
   and diffusion-using HVAC system terminal pipeline layout data. Accuracy
   and precision metrics were used to compare the generated designs with
   automated forward design solutions, assessing the models' ability to
   capture both local variations and broader changes in design logic. A
   graph-neural-network-based evaluation method was employed to measure the
   models' capacity to detect changes. The results indicate that all four
   models achieved prediction accuracies exceeding 90\% and precision rates
   above 75\%. The models effectively captured both local modifications
   made by designers and global design changes, showing greater sensitivity
   to global layout adjustments than to local updates. When comparing the
   results generated by deep graph generative models and the actual design,
   it is obvious that the accuracy of the predictions varies significantly
   due to the complexity of the test buildings.},

Abstract = {Creating Digital Twin models for already existing substations is one of
   the big challenges for the Transmission and Distribution (T\&D)
   electrical industry - to reach the goal of digitalization of the assets.
   The Digital Twin follows all changes and represents the physical twin in
   a digital model - can be used for simulating, analysis of data,
   understanding of problems, monitoring and simulation of real-world
   conditions. To get a Digital Twin with innovative methods and less
   effort, the Scan to Twin principle is introduced, by creating - out of
   point clouds - a smart Building Information Modeling (BIM) model and
   Digital Twin with connections to other databases, as a real Virtual
   Reality (VR) substation simulation model. This paper describes the
   process of how to get the models, step by step, with a real use-case of
   an existing substation project of a transmission operator. The paper
   introduces a newly developed VR client solution connected to a BIM
   engineering solution to create - in a few clicks - VR models of existing
   substation BIM models.},

Title = {Research on the green development path of prefabricated building
   industry based on intelligent technology},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 22},
Abstract = {PurposeIn order to make the construction industry develop in the
   direction of greening, this paper analyzes whether the application of
   intelligent technology in prefabricated buildings can achieve carbon
   emission reduction, starting from the problems of weak technology and
   insufficient encouragement policies in the prefabricated building
   industry. It also designs dynamic and adjustable incentives for the
   smart transformation of prefabricated buildings and makes
   recommendations to facilitate the transformation of assembly
   manufacturers into ``smart factories{''}.Design/methodology/approachThis
   paper takes the intelligent technology for carbon reduction, energy
   efficiency and policy design in the prefabricated buildings industry as
   the starting point. Based on in-depth expert interviews and
   questionnaire survey data, a linear multiple regression model is used to
   establish an association network of intelligent technology in the
   production and transportation, construction, operation and maintenance,
   demolition and scrapping stages. On this basis, an evolutionary game
   theory is used to construct a smart transformation and carbon reduction
   utility game model between the government and manufacturers, and
   relevant suggestions for smart empowerment of green construction
   development technology combinations and policy settings are
   proposed.FindingsAn assembly manufacturing plant with smart empowerment
   is an important way to achieve green and sustainable development in the
   construction industry. Among them, BIM and IoT have made a greater
   impact on carbon emission reduction of prefabricated buildings in all
   stages of the whole life cycle. The government's proposed energy
   efficiency incentives and environmental tax amount will effectively
   increase companies' motivation for smart transformation of prefabricated
   buildings. However, when the environmental tax amount is low, the
   government should strengthen the regulation of the industry in order to
   increase the speed of smart transformation of assembly manufacturers.
   Therefore, a reasonable setting of the environmental tax rate and
   energy-saving incentives and flexible adjustment of the regulatory
   efforts can maximize the functional utility of the government in the
   process of smart transformation.Research limitations/implicationsThis
   paper focuses on the impact of intelligent technologies on the overall
   carbon emissions of the industry and provides an evolutionary analysis
   of the strategic game between the government and assembly manufacturers,
   the main players in the smart transformation process of prefabricated
   buildings. However, smart technologies for different categories of
   assembly manufacturing plants and strategic options for a wider range of
   stakeholders have not been examined in depth.Originality/valueDifferent
   from existing research, this study focuses on exploring the strategic
   game between the government and assembly manufacturers in the smart
   transformation of prefabricated buildings. It provides an innovative
   explanation of the connection between intelligent technology and carbon
   emissions. The study develops an evolutionary game model for both
   parties, addressing the research gap on the combined effects of policy
   incentives and intelligent technology on carbon reduction and efficiency
   improvement in the prefabricated buildings industry.
   This research not only offers practical reference for the government in
   designing incentive mechanisms and establishing regulatory systems but
   also provides feasible practical guidance for the smart transformation
   and carbon reduction efforts of assembly manufacturing plants.},

Abstract = {As a game-changing technology with significant environmental, economic,
   and social benefits, prefabricated technology has attracted attention
   and has been increasingly adopted in the construction industry. Although
   multitudinous studies have investigated various aspects of
   prefabrication in construction, a thorough review of its current
   development state that synthesized environmental, economic, and social
   sustainability dimensions remains overdue. Therefore, this study aims to
   fill this research gap by constructing a systematic framework, analyzing
   the research status quos, and providing recommendations for future
   research. This study first conducted a holistic review of 768 references
   with NVivo. A research foci framework that represented the body of
   knowledge in prefabrication in construction was developed with five
   levels, which were advantages, hindrances, stakeholders, promotion
   policies, and strategy spectrum. Following the framework, the in-depth
   analyses from the perspectives of environmental, economic, social
   sustainability, technologies development, and promotion strategies were
   performed. The current research domains were further linked with
   potential research directions for promoting prefabricated construction
   towards sustainability. The study is of value in both offering
   references for policy formulation and stakeholder practice and providing

Abstract = {This paper presents in detail the legislation and regulation related to
   the use and ownership of building complexes with multiple units
   (apartments, condominiums) in Saudi Arabia for the 3D registration of
   the legal spaces. The 3D Land Administration Domain Model (LADM)country
   profile for Saudi Arabia must be able to represent the identified
   concepts for multi-owner buildings. Today, there is a trend to directly
   design these buildings in 3D. Within the spatial development lifecycle
   thinking, this design will be reused via Building Information Modelling
   (BIM)/ Industry Foundation Class (IFC) encodings in the subsequent
   phases, such as, obtaining permits, financing, constructing, etc.
   However, in order to support the next step, the cadastral registration,
   we present, at this paper, a mapping from the BIM/IFC to the LADM, both
   at conceptual modelling and at the level of the individual units with
   their geometry and topology. This mapping requires that the BIM/IFC file
   contains sufficient information to identify the different spaces being
   part of a property. Three different main type of spaces are identified:
   private part, common part, and exclusive common part. A single property
   may contain multiple disconnected components, such as the main
   apartment, the storage in the basement, and a car park. In turn, a
   component, such as the main apartment, may contain multiple connected
   spaces, i.e. the various rooms of the main apartment. In addition to
   mapping the concepts at class level from IFC to LADM, we also extract
   rules for treating the spaces of various types of walls, slabs, roofs,
   and constructive elements, such as foundation and pillars. The presented
   approach is tested with a real-world example IFC file, identifying the
   issues to be improved, i.e. guidelines for the Architecture, Engineering
   and Construction (AEC) sector to produce IFC file which can be more easy
   used as input for 3D Land Administration with minimal manual
   interventions. This research bridges the gap between the
   project-oriented world of the AEC sector (with BIM/IFC files) and the
   legal registration as described through the ISO 19152. Though many of
   the presented findings are based on the legislation and case study in
   Saudi Arabia, we have the rather strong impression, that these findings
   will not be very different in other countries.},

Abstract = {Over the last few years, Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI) has been
   gradually exploring the potential contributions of embedded design and
   construction information contained in the building information model (
   BIM). The recent completion of a new mixed-use facility at the WPI
   campus provided an excellent opportunity to plan and execute an
   integrated approach to streamline the information handover between the
   designer, builder, and owner of this facility. This paper presents and
   evaluates the approach followed by the project team to accomplish such
   an integrated information handover. It describes the collaborative
   contractual strategy developed by the project team and their consultants
   and subcontractors. It also describes the implementation/ execution plan
   involving the design and construction professionals as well as the
   academic opportunities and contributions by student projects. It also
   presents the results obtained at the completion of the construction and
   the plans to maintain continuity with information updates throughout the
   project lifecycle.},

Title = {Developing WSN/BIM-Based Environmental Monitoring Management System for
   Parking Garages in Smart Cities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, there have been many serious problems with air
   pollution (such as hazardous gases) in environmental management for
   parking garages of cities. These problems should be continuously
   improved and enhanced for smart cities. Building information modeling
   (BIM) has been revolutionary in construction industry applications; it
   integrates different kinds of construction information into a 3D digital
   model and can be applied in all stages of a project lifecycle.
   Furthermore, the wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important key
   technology in Internet of Things (IoT) development. In order to improve
   the performance of environmental monitoring management of parking
   garages in smart cities, this study proposes a planning approach for
   integration of WSN and BIM technologies and develops an advanced
   monitoring and control system for underground parking garage environment
   monitoring, adopting WSN and BIM technologies for digital twin (DT)
   application of Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Many WSN nodes with sensing and
   control capabilities were placed in a parking garage to collect carbon
   monoxide (CO), temperature, and humidity conditions in real time. All
   the collected information was transferred by a WSN self-constituted
   network, and the different location conditions were integrated and
   dynamically displayed on corresponding spatial components of a 3D BIM
   model. The proposed system was applied in a case study of a parking
   garage in Taipei to verify the system and demonstrate its effectiveness
   in practice. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is a
   visually effective monitoring system for environmental monitoring
   management. Finally, this study proposes a conclusion, suggestions,
   benefits, and limitations for further application.},

Abstract = {Urban planning solutions and decisions have large-scale significance for
   ecological sustainability, eco-efficiency, the consumption of energy and
   other natural resources, the production of greenhouse gas and other
   emissions, and the costs caused by urban form.
   The EcoBalance Model was developed to assess sustainability of urban
   form and has been applied at various planning levels: regional plans,
   local master plans and detailed plans. The EcoBalance model estimates
   the total consumption of energy and other natural resources, the
   production of emissions and wastes and the costs caused directly and
   indirectly by urban form on a life cycle basis. The results of the case
   studies provide information about the ecological impacts of various
   solutions in urban development.
   Planning solutions may impact on greenhouse gas emissions by 10\% at the
   regional level, 60\% at the local community level, and even 200\% at the
   local dwelling area level. Impact on emissions caused by transportation
   is even bigger: at least double compared to the impact on total
   emissions. Similarly, large impacts can be seen concerning the
   consumption of energy and other natural resources, as well as costs.
   The most important factors in sustainable urban planning are at the
   dwelling area level - location, structure, building density, house
   types, space heating systems; at the community and regional level - area
   density, energy consumption and production systems, location and
   distances between dwellings, working places and services, transportation
   systems, possibilities for walking and cycling, availability of public
   transport and necessity for the use of private cars.},

Title = {Virtual Building Models in built environments},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The global building sector plays a pivotal role in addressing
   sustainability, climate change, and carbon neutrality. This study
   introduces the original concept of virtual building models (VBMs)
   throughout the lifecycle of the building industry, considering the
   unique characteristics of this industry. VBMs are defined as
   mathematical models that represent the physical behavior of buildings
   throughout their lifecycle. These models consist of subvirtual models
   that represent the physical operational environments of the target
   building, encompassing physical variables, equipment, systems, indoor
   environments, and structural and material behaviors. This concept can
   contribute to achieving the existing concepts of building information
   modeling, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems within building
   operations, communities, and environments. In this study, building
   models are categorized into five aspects: virtual model environments,
   types, interactions, integrations, and levels of detail (LODs). The LODs
   are classified into five levels (LOD100, LOD200, LOD300, LOD350, and
   LOD400) depending on the primary environments of the virtual models and
   their coverage across the entire building. Virtual modeling
   methodologies are proposed considering the virtual model aspects to
   achieve higher or intended LOD states from both academic and industrial
   perspectives. Finally, future research directions are discussed to drive
   the concept of virtual buildings to shape the future of the building
   industry through digital transformations.},

   relationship information},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& HUMAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {15-28},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Understanding the contribution of childbearing to social disadvantages
   of teenage mothers requires estimates that control for unobservables and
   generalize to teenage mothers. Sibling-differences and Instrumental
   Variables (IV) are common approaches to this end. Using the ``Add
   Health{''} data, which oversampled siblings, and building on IV
   specifications from a widely-cited study, we compare various estimates
   of the consequences of teenage childbearing for schooling attainment.
   These IV-based estimates suggest moderate to large adverse impacts of
   teenage births (point estimates of -0.7 years of schooling or larger).
   However, the IV estimates are highly sensitive to choice of instrument
   and model specification. Estimates based on sibling and twin differences
   are consistently near zero-e.g., an estimated difference of -0.1 years
   between a teen mother and her biological full sister who did not have a
   teen birth-and are estimated with sufficient precision to exclude
   effects larger than -0.5 years. We review concerns about sibling methods
   and conclude that, despite their limitations, sibling estimates should
   be admitted along with other evidence on the consequences of teenage
   childbearing. Appreciation of the sensitivity of IV estimates and their
   other limitations would reinforce this conclusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier

   systems by using ANN},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) technique as a
   new approach to evaluate the energy input, losses, output, efficiency,
   and economic optimization of a geothermal district heating system
   (GDHS). By using ANN, an energetic analysis is evaluated on the Afyon
   geothermal district heating system (AGDHS) located in the city of
   Afyonkarahisar, Turkey. Promising results are obtained about the
   economic evaluation of that system. This has been used to determine if
   the existing system is operating at its optimal level, and will provide
   information about the optimal design and profitable operation of the
   system. The results of the study show that the ANN model used for the
   prediction of the energy performance of the AGDHS has good statistical
   performance values: a correlation coefficient of 0.9983 with minimum RMS
   and MAPE values. The total cost for the AGDHS is profitable when the PWF
   is higher than 7.9. However, the PWF of the AGDHS was found to be 1.43
   for the given values. As a result, while installing a GDHS, one should
   take into account the influences of the PWF, ambient temperature and
   flow rate on the total costs of the system in any location where it is
   to be established. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   attempt to harness this power of WOM by introducing referral reward
   programs and other marketing instruments that aim to stimulate positive
   WOM. However, scholars have neglected to research the possibility that
   providing WOM also has consequences for the sender. Building on
   self-perception theory, this article argues that recommending a service
   provider improves the current customers' loyalty to the provider and
   that positive WOM is not only effective for gaining but also for keeping
   customers. By conducting experiments in two different service settings,
   it is demonstrated that providing a recommendation influences the
   senders' attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. The effect is found to be
   stronger for customers with low expertise in the service category and
   little experience with the provider. This means that encouraging
   customers in the early stages of their customer life cycle to give
   recommendations is specifically effective in increasing loyalty to the
   provider. Managers should consider using positive WOM as a
   loyalty-enhancing instrument and take the additional value from
   increased loyalty of their customer base into account for
   return-on-marketing calculations regarding WOM marketing campaigns, as
   well as customer equity calculations.},

Abstract = {Plastics contain various chemical substances, which can impact human and
   ecosystem health and the transition to a circular economy. Meanwhile,
   information on the presence of individual substances in plastics is
   generally not made publicly available, but relies on extensive
   analytical efforts. Here, we review measurement studies of chemicals in
   plastics and compile them into a new LitChemPlast database. Over 3500
   substances, stemming from all plastic life-cycle stages, have been
   detected in different plastics in 372 studies. Approximately 75\% of
   them have only been detected in nontargeted workflows, while targeted
   analyses have focused on limited well-known substances, particularly
   metal(loid)s, brominated flame retardants, and ortho-phthalates. Some
   product categories have rarely been studied despite economic importance,
   e.g., consumer and industrial packaging (other than food packaging),
   building and construction, and automotive plastics. Likewise, limited
   studies have investigated recycled plastics, while existing measurements
   of recycled plastics show higher detection frequencies and median
   concentrations of regulated brominated flame retardants across many
   product categories. The LitChemPlast database may be further developed
   or utilized, e.g., for exposure assessment or substance flow analysis.
   Nonetheless, the plethora of relevant substances and products
   underscores the necessity for additional measures to enable the
   transition to a safe circular plastics economy.},

Title = {Implementation of augmented reality and mixed reality applications for
   smart facilities management: a systematic review},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 15},
Abstract = {Purpose - The Operations and Maintenance (O\&M) cost of a facility is
   typically 60-85\% of the total life cycle cost of a building whereas its
   design and construction cost accounts for only 5-10\%. Therefore,
   enhancing and optimizing the O\&M of a facility is a crucial issue. In
   addition, with the increasing complexities in a building's operating
   systems, more technologically advanced solutions are required for
   proactively maintaining a facility. Thereby, a tool is needed which can
   optimize and reduce the cost of facility maintenance. One of the
   solutions is Augmented or Mixed Reality (AR/MR) technologies which can
   reduce repair time, training time and streamline inspections. Therefore,
   the purpose of this study is to establish contextual knowledge of AR/MR
   application in facilities operation and maintenance and present an
   implementation framework through the analysis and classification of
   articles published between 2015 and 2022.Design/methodology/approach -
   To effectively understand all AR/MR applications in facilities
   management (FM), a systematic literature review is performed. The
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
   (PRISMA) protocol was followed for searching and describing the search
   strategies. Keywords were identified through the concept mapping
   technique. The Scopus database and Google Scholar were employed to find
   relevant articles, books and conference papers. A thorough bibliometric
   analysis was conducted using VOS Viewer and subsequently, a thematic
   analysis was performed for the selected publications.Findings - The use
   of AR/MR within facilities O\&M could be categorized into five different
   application areas: (1) visualization; (2) maintenance; (3) indoor
   localization and positioning; (4) information management and (5) indoor
   environment. After a thematic analysis of the literature, it was found
   that maintenance and indoor localization were the most frequently used
   research application domains. The chronological evolution of AR/ MR in
   FM is also presented along with the origin of publications, which showed
   that the technology is out of its infancy stage and is ready for
   implementation. However, literature showed many challenges hindering
   this goal, that is (1) reluctance of the organizational leadership to
   bear the cost of hardware and trainings for the employees, (2) Lack of
   BIM use in FM and (3) system lagging, crashing and unable to register
   the real environment. A preliminary framework is presented to overcome
   these challenges. Originality/value - This study accommodates a variety
   of application domains within facilities O\&M. The publications were
   systematically selected from the existing literature and then reviewed
   to exhibit various AR/MR applications to support FM. There have been no
   literature reviews that focus on AR and/or MR in the FM and this paper
   fills the gap by not only presenting its applications but also
   developing an implementation framework.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology to enable environmental
   sustainability and productivity performance assessment for integrated
   process and operation plans at the machine cell level of a manufacturing
   system. This approach determines optimal process and operation plans
   from a range of possible alternatives that satisfy the objectives and
   constraints. The methodology provides a systematic procedure to
   highlight parameters that have significant impact on both sustainability
   and productivity performance metrics. We developed models and applied
   them to analyze manufacturing life cycle scenarios for collecting and
   categorizing key concepts towards building a material information model
   for sustainability. Integration of process and operation plans allows
   globalized assessment of sustainability and productivity, while
   development of a multi-criteria decision-making method leads to
   optimization of process planning activities based on the impact of
   conflicting sustainability and productivity metrics. A case study is
   detailed to demonstrate the sustainability-focused methodology, wherein
   integrated simulation and optimization techniques are used to support
   analysis of candidate scenarios and selection of preferred alternatives
   from a finite set of alternate process and operation plans. A discrete
   event simulation tool is used to model evolution of sustainability
   metrics (e.g., energy consumption) and productivity metrics (e.g.,
   production time, cost) of a shop floor. The outcomes of this work
   include determination of optimized feature sequence plans which optimize
   various key performance indicators depending on stakeholder interest
   based on time, sustainability and production cost.},

Title = {Reliability evaluation index for the integrated supply chain utilising
   BIM and lean approaches},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {997-1038},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Purpose This research aims to develop an approach to assess the
   reliability of integrated construction supply chains via an integrated
   model of building information modelling (BIM) and the lean supply chain
   (LSC). It reflects the synergistic workflow between BIM and LSC as a
   novel approach to improve the reliability of construction projects.
   Design/methodology/approach This research evaluates the reliability of
   the BIM-LSC approach through a combination of entropy theory, set pair
   analysis (SPA), and Markov chains (EESM). An exploratory survey was
   conducted to collect data from 316 industry professionals experienced in
   BIM and LSC. Subsequently, multiple cycles of calculations were
   performed with indirect data inputs. Finally, a reliability evaluation
   index is established for the BIM-LSC approach and potential applications
   are identified. Findings The results show that the EESM model of BIM-LSC
   developed in this study can handle not only supply chain reliability
   evaluation at a given state but also the prediction of reliability in
   supply chain state transitions due to changing project conditions. This
   is particularly relevant to the current environment of the construction
   project, which is characterised by an increasing level of complexity in
   terms of labour, technology, and resource interactions.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research could consider the
   accuracy and validity of the proposed model in real-life scenarios with
   by considering both quantitative and qualitative data across the entire
   lifecycle of projects.
   Practical implications - The research offers a model to evaluate the
   reliability of the BIM-LSC approach. The accuracy of BIM supply chain
   reliability analysis and prediction in an uncertain environment is
   improved.
   Originality/value The BIM-LSC reliability evaluation and prediction
   presented in this study provides a theoretical foundation to enhance
   understanding of the BIM-LSC in the construction project context.},

Abstract = {At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into
   a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of
   various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under
   complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial
   intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration
   of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction
   projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear
   understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction
   management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive
   investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility
   to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of
   automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis
   and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the
   status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire
   lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords
   that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning,
   internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving
   as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional
   civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the
   log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and
   discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and
   rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building
   performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin.
   Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to
   more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of
   human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain,
   aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.},

Abstract = {The development process for the new kind of Intelligent Factories and
   Industry 4.0 systems requires a different approach than before, because
   the complexity and flexibility of all industrial systems increases. The
   development process has to ensure that every product is manufactured at
   the end with an efficient production process. Under these conditions,
   data management and the use of simulations become more important.
   Furthermore, the couplings and interrelations between product and means
   of production play a key role in the areas of digital factory and
   virtual commissioning. Only by using both simulation methods it will
   become apparent how the product can be manufactured. But to create a
   virtual commissioning model, a lot of data is needed from the entire
   development process. This data is usually generated interdisciplinarily
   by people from various departments. However, today's form of data
   management as information transfer is only conditionally suitable for
   efficiently building up a digital factory as a simulation model or even
   making a virtual commissioning of a production system. Due to the fact
   that in the development process a lot of IT systems with interfaces
   inbetween are used, loss of information is quite common experience. This
   is where graph-based design languages come in. Using this modeling
   language approach, the product is completely digitally described and
   then the means of production are derived from the product properties
   automatically. This creates a consistent digital product life cycle from
   the initial product requirements to virtual commissioning.},

Abstract = {One aim of synthetic biologists is to create novel and predictable
   biological systems from simpler modular parts. This approach is
   currently hampered by a lack of well-defined and characterized parts and
   devices. However, there is a wealth of existing biological information,
   which can be used to identify and characterize biological parts, and
   their design constraints in the literature and numerous biological
   databases. However, this information is spread among these databases in
   many different formats. New computational approaches are required to
   make this information available in an integrated format that is more
   amenable to data mining. A tried and tested approach to this problem is
   to map disparate data sources into a single data set, with common syntax
   and semantics, to produce a data warehouse or knowledge base. Ontologies
   have been used extensively in the life sciences, providing this common
   syntax and semantics as a model for a given biological domain, in a
   fashion that is amenable to computational analysis and reasoning. Here,
   we present an ontology for applications in synthetic biology design,
   SyBiOnt, which facilitates the modeling of information about biological
   parts and their relationships. SyBiOnt was used to create the SyBiOntKB
   knowledge base, incorporating and building upon existing life sciences
   ontologies and standards. The reasoning capabilities of ontologies were
   then applied to automate the mining of biological parts from this
   knowledge base. We propose that this approach will be useful to speed up
   synthetic biology design and ultimately help facilitate the automation
   of the biological engineering life cycle.},

Title = {Digital mock-ups as support tools for preventing risks related to energy
   sources in the operation stage of industrial facilities through design},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) and product lifecycle management
   (PLM) technologies provide automatic model checking (AMC) tools that can
   be used for the prevention of occupational health and safety (OHS) risks
   through design (PtD). Considering that the risks related to energy
   sources during the operation stage of industrial facilities can be
   major, our objective is to propose a PtD approach for this type of risk
   that uses AMC tools. For this purpose, our methodology is based on the
   information systems design-science paradigm. Considering that both BIM
   and PLM mock-ups can be used to design industrial facilities and that
   Catia V5 is one of the main software programs used to design industrial
   equipment and facilities, our methodology specifically includes a
   comparative literature review of the uses of AMC tools to check BIM and
   PLM mock-ups and a comparative study of the OHS risk prevention
   capabilities of the AMC tools available in Catia V5. Therefore, the PtD
   approach that we propose is specific to Catia V5. It consists of: 1)
   extracting rules related to hazardous energy control from regulatory
   requirements and classifying them according to their automation
   potential, 2) expressing the rules in a form that is compatible with the
   RASE method, 3) interpreting the rules using the RASE method, and 4)
   using a macro script to automatically check the compliance of the
   digital mock-ups. The proposed approach's contri-bution is that it makes
   it possible to support facility designers in automatically identifying
   hazardous energy sources in systems. In future studies, we intend to
   couple this PtD approach with methods that integrate dynamic system
   behavior to assess the level of risk corresponding to the hazardous
   sources identified.},

Abstract = {The research aim of the paper is to review and to describe best
   practices for marketing and to highlight the characteristics of
   marketing-management. System analysis, analytical and comparative
   methods were used for this research. The paper deals with marketing
   changes, which have been happening in the business community for last
   years. Nowadays a number of companies define marketing as a basis for
   management decisionmaking, abandoning the traditional model in which
   marketers were only focused on selling already produced goods. The
   authors of the paper consider that such a model is the future of a
   client-oriented business. Using this model, the company's marketing
   structures are connected at the stage of creating a new product and are
   actively involved in its entire life cycle. This concept allows
   companies to create a necessary product for the consumer, and sometimes
   to anticipate his/her needs, which makes the companies stand out from
   the majority of competitors. The paper also notes that in our society
   the main values of companies are not production facilities that are
   owned, but intellectual resources and the ability to use information
   about customers. Thus, the development of the brand and focus on the
   consumer, rather than building up physical assets, becomes the main
   driving force of the company's development. The companies that learn how
   to handle a huge amount of information about their customers and
   anticipate their needs, creating new products and services, will be able
   to succeed in a highly competitive environment.},

Journal = {HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},

Number = {4},
Pages = {353-383},
Abstract = {This article explores the consequences of the uncertainty introduced
   into the system-development life cycle by a prototyping approach and the
   practical strategies employed by developers in prototyping projects.
   Drawing on various strands of the sociology of technology, the article
   discusses findings from a multidisciplinary research project, which
   investigated the use of prototyping in commercial information systems
   development in the United Kingdom during the period 1995 to 1998.
   Qualitative semistructured interviews with commercial practitioners were
   followed by a series of mini case studies. We draw on interview and
   participant observation material and the practitioner literature on
   Rapid Application Development. In the course of the project, we
   encountered a variety of practical strategies that attempted to extend
   the sphere of developers' influence beyond the technical realm to affect
   (but not determine) how the user and customer participate in the
   development process. Various techniques attempt to create a climate of
   joint ownership and shared approaches to change management. For example,
   the role of an ambassador user encompasses shaping the environment in
   which the system will operate via information, training, and advocacy.
   Rather than a cause-and-effect model from user requirements to
   specification to implementation, developer strategies usefully can be
   considered in terms of sociological work on reflexive elaboration of
   networks. From this perspective, prototyping is more akin to trying to
   stabilize a network of evolving prototypes, user expectations,
   requirements, and working practices than meeting a fixed specification.},

Title = {A conceptual ontological framework for managing the social business

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Nowadays, organizations strive for business process optimization to
   survive the current competitive business environment. The widespread use
   of social media and Web 2.0 applications has dramatically changed the
   structure of the business process. Such evolution caused an increase in
   the flow of data and information, which led to knowledge-intensive
   business processes. Thus, modeling the knowledge-intensive processes
   became essential to make use of the flow of knowledge from social media
   and to fulfill their demanding requirements. Therefore, knowledge and
   social dimensions should be integrated into the traditional business
   process life cycle. This integration yields a large flow of customer
   knowledge that needs to be efficiently used and managed. Moreover, the
   use of ontologies for knowledge representation opens up a supplementary
   view for providing machine-accessible terminology to processes.
   Ontologies make a significant contribution to the categorization and
   organization of the incorporated and unstructured information. This
   paper proposes a framework that integrates the social business processes
   with a knowledge base in the form of an ontology to manage and enhance
   the overall customer experience. The proposed framework aims to enable
   organizations to improve knowledge support for their customer-driven
   business processes. In addition, the extracted knowledge from social
   media will support organizations in managing the customer knowledge and
   building up the relationships with customers. The proposed social
   ontology will ease the querying of existing customer knowledge and
   inferring new knowledge that enhances optimizing the business process,
   and customer experience.},

Abstract = {With the advent of the information age, the Internet of Things (IoTs)
   technology has been favored by many industries and became another
   in-depth revolution of information technology industry. Under such an
   era, the application of the IoTs technology to the construction of
   intelligent buildings can broaden the practicality of intelligent
   systems, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the management and
   service capabilities of intelligent buildings, thereby improving
   people's quality of life. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing
   previous research works, this paper elaborates the development status
   and future challenges of the IoTs technology, analyzes the impact of
   IoTs technology on intelligent buildings and intelligent manufacturing,
   and expounds the integrated system framework of intelligent building and
   building information model (BIM) technology, and proposes the system
   design of intelligent building and the architecture model of intelligent
   manufacturing based on the IoTs technology. The model verification
   results show that the intelligent manufacturing model of construction

Title = {Geographic Information System-assisted optimal design of renewable
   powered electric vehicle charging stations in high-density cities},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The crowded urban environment and busy traffic lead to heavy roadside
   pollutions in high-density cities, thereby causing health damages to
   city pedestrians. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered as a promising
   solution to such street-level air pollutions. Currently, in high-density
   cities, the number of public charging stations is limited, and they are
   far from enough to form a complete charging network with a high coverage
   ratio that can provide easy and convenient charging services for EV
   users. Concerns and worries on being unable to find a charging port when
   needed become a major hurdle to EV practical applications. Meanwhile,
   greener and cheaper renewable energy is recommended to replace fossil
   fuel-based grid energy that is commonly used in existing charging
   stations. Thus, this study proposes a novel Geographic Information
   System (GIS) assisted optimal design method for renewable powered EV
   charging stations in high-density cities. By selecting the optimal
   locations and optimal number of the renewable powered charging stations
   with the considerations of the existing charging stations and renewable
   potentials, the proposed method is able to minimize the life cycle cost
   of the charging stations while satisfying a user defined area coverage
   ratio. Using Hong Kong as an example, case studies have been conducted
   to verify the proposed design method. The design method can be used in
   practice to help high-density cities build their public charging
   networks with cost-effectiveness, which will promote EV practical
   applications and thus alleviate the roadside air pollutions in
   high-density cities.},

Abstract = {Using 3D building models is extremely helpful throughout the
   architecture engineering and construction (AEC) lifecycle. Such models
   coupled with virtual walk through can enable customers to decide and be
   satisfied with their dream building. Manually creating a polygonal 3D
   model of a set of floor plans is nontrivial and requires skill and time.
   This project introduces and reviews a mechanism for applying interior
   and exterior design constructs after the conversion of 2D drawings into
   3D Building Information Model (BIM). This research demonstrates an
   automated 3D model reconstruction of real world object from an
   un-calibrated image sequence targeting the same scene; which can be used
   for interior and exterior design. There are many key techniques in 3D
   reconstruction from image sequences, including feature matching,
   fundamental matrix estimation, projective reconstruction, camera
   self-calibration, dense stereo matching and Euclidean reconstruction.
   The effectiveness of the algorithms was evaluated in the experiments
   with many real image sequences.},

Abstract = {The application of Information Technology (IT) to construction project
   management (CPM) has become crucial to the completion of projects in
   accordance with the specifications of time, quality and costs. However,
   there are difficulties in visualising the planning and work progress in
   space and integrating information between stakeholders. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) can gather necessary information at
   different stages of a project's lifecycle, including production
   management. This study aims at discussing strategies for the
   representation and analyses of a building construction 4D Model for
   planning and control and evaluating the importance and applicability of
   4D Modelling to CPM, based on the survey conducted with the
   professionals from the Brazilian construction sector using a Google Docs
   questionnaire. The survey questions comprise the evaluation of
   potentialities, strategies for representation and analyses, such as the
   colour use for the differentiation of internal activities and
   alternatives of physical advance monitoring through the Planned x
   Realized schedule simulation or visualisation of them on split screen,
   ending with the evaluation of the 4D Modelling adoption. The results
   indicate the degrees of importance and applicability of the 4D Modelling

Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},

Abstract = {According to the concept of sustainable development, the process of
   extending the life-cycle of existing buildings (including historical
   ones) through their restoration not only generates benefits from their
   layer use but also-and primarily-constitutes a chance for their
   substance to survive for use by future generations. Building restoration
   projects are usually difficult to plan, primarily due to the limited
   amount of information on the technical condition of existing structures
   and their historical substance, which often makes the scope of
   renovation works difficult to determine. At the stage of planning such a
   project, it is, therefore, reasonable to consider various scenarios of
   its implementation, the occurrence of which can be both random and can
   be generated by the decision-maker. Unfortunately, in practice, the
   right tools for planning such projects are not used, which in effect
   generates problems associated with underestimating their completion time
   and costs. In subject literature, there are proposals of the use of
   stochastic and decision networks to assess the course of various
   projects that are characterised by having indeterminate structures.
   However, these networks are limited to modelling tasks that either occur
   purely randomly or are fully generated by decision-makers. There are no
   studies that enable the modelling and optimisation of the structure of a
   project while taking into consideration both the random and
   decision-based nature of carrying it out. In the article, the authors
   proposed a stochastic decision network that enables the correct
   modelling of projects with a multi-variant structure of being carried
   out. For the purpose of analysing the network model, elements of
   mathematical programming were used to determine optimal decisions (in
   terms of expected costs and completion times of carrying out a project)
   that control the structure of the project being modelled. The entirety
   of the authors' proposal was backed by a calculation experiment on an
   example of a refurbishment construction project, which confirmed the
   application potential of the proposed approach.},

Title = {A MODEL-DRIVEN APPROACH TO THE INTEGRATION OF PRODUCT MODELS INTO
   CROSS-DOMAIN ANALYSES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {253-274},
Abstract = {During the many phases in the lifecycle of a building, an ever growing
   number of dynamic and static aspects are encountered that seem worthy of
   modelling in a computer-readable representation. Product models that
   attempt to cover the concepts from the many disciplines or phases in a
   product's lifecycle face a dilemma, namely maintaining a balance between
   growing model complexity on the one hand, and user requests for
   additional concept coverage on the other. In examining the main
   principles of model theory (Stachowiak 1973) more closely, this paper
   tries to identify tendencies that may hamper the balance between
   complexity and completeness. However, a scientific evaluation of model
   complexity needs objective measures. Metrics for the assessment of
   software complexity are readily available and can also be applied to
   models, since models (schema or instance) can automatically be
   transformed into a programming language (Hartmann, von Both 2010) or an
   instance structure. These metrics can therefore be helpful in the
   discussion about model complexity. Different approaches have been taken
   to handling model complexity and the complex process of modelling
   itself. Leal S. et al. (2014) develop a template-based model generating
   tool for energy simulation models to evade the lossy and complex
   recourse to IFC or gbXML models. Cao J. et al. (2014) use a
   transformation tool to generate building energy performance simulation
   models in order to reduce the complexity otherwise encountered in
   traditional building simulation programs. Thomas D. et al (2014) combine
   a CitySim model holding a simplified representation of the surrounding
   buildings with models for the EnergyPlus building performance engine.
   This allows for rapid assessment of the performance of the early
   design-stage building information models (BIM) on both the building and
   urban systems scale. Koene F. et al. (2014) take the reductionist idea
   of model theory a step further by reducing a building to a simple model
   consisting of two thermal masses.
   The Building Lifecycle Management Department at Karlsruhe Institute of
   Technology KIT conducts analyses beyond the scope of a single building.
   Analyses often have to take the urban environment into account, meaning
   that not only building models but also models of the surrounding city
   area are potentially involved. From the modelling standpoint this raises
   the question as to whether the city model and building models should be
   unified into one ``super model{''}, or whether models should be kept
   separate and the relations between them expressed by means of meta data.
   The work presented is a result of the research project ``A model-driven
   approach to the integration of product models into cross-domain analysis
   processes{''} (original title: ``Ein modellgetriebener Ansatz zur
   Integration von Produktmodellen in domanenubergreifende
   Analyseprozesse{''}) sponsored by the federal German research funding
   organization `Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)'.},

Abstract = {Digital transformation in the architecture industry encounters
   challenges such as data silos within design stages, between design and
   construction, and across the entire industry chain, including BIM and
   project management. This study introduces a pioneering approach for
   seamlessly integrating building information modeling (BIM) and product
   lifecycle management (PLM) within the management framework and
   collaborative workflows of architectural design and construction. The
   proposed methodology was implemented in two major projects, namely, the
   Wuhan Next-Generation Weather Radar Construction Project and the Hubei
   Center for Disease Control and Prevention Comprehensive Capacity
   Enhancement Project (Phase I), with the former being China's first
   end-to-end digitally integrated construction project. Compared with
   traditional projects, these implementations achieved improvements of
   24.39\% and 38.04\%, respectively, in objective function values. The
   findings highlight the unique advantages of BIM-PLM integration in
   optimizing lifecycle management, enhancing cross-disciplinary,
   cross-enterprise, and cross-regional collaboration, improving project
   design efficiency and quality, and reducing costs and waste. This
   integration provides valuable insights into the digital advancement of
   the construction industry.},

Title = {A Critical Review of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Use in Architecture
   and Urbanism: Scientometric and Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years the use of UAVs (Unmanned aerial vehicles) have
   proliferated in the civil sector for purposes such as search and rescue,
   remote sensing or real-time monitoring of road traffic, among others. In
   the architecture, engineering and construction fields (AEC) UAVs have
   demonstrated to be an ideal technology due to their optimal performance
   in terms of time, precision, safety and cost. Given the rapid growth of
   interest in this technology, this research presents a critical review of
   the literature on the use of UAVs in architecture and urbanism to define
   the most widely used techniques and delimit the fields of application
   based on the experimentation published by the scientific community. A
   scientific mapping was carried out in two stages using the VOSviewer(TM)
   software: a scientometric and a bibliometric analysis. This technique
   allowed us to analyse a large body of literature and bibliographic data
   to obtain trends, patterns and directions of this domain of knowledge.
   Then, a literature review was presented, highlighting the relevant
   information identified in the previous analysis. The fields of
   application of UAVs were delimited and the most commonly used payload
   types and the most appropriate post-processing techniques were
   specified, depending on the aerial mission objective. The fields of
   application identified included different techniques related to the
   generation of 3D models, land mapping, construction site monitoring,
   building surveying to detect structural damage and energy losses and
   urban remote sensing. The literature review showed that UAVs provide a
   useful multi-tasking tool at any stage of an architectural project.
   These techniques can be applied to buildings or public spaces from the
   design and construction processes when the project is initiated to the
   later stages of maintenance and inspection of the building during its
   life cycle.},

Title = {A bibliometric visual analysis of the system dynamics approach for
   construction and demolition waste management},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Continuously increasing amounts of construction and demolition waste
   (C\&DW) is a critical problem globally. As a quantitative modeling
   approach to solve complex problems, system dynamics (SD) is frequently
   adopted to help understand the dynamic interrelationship of contributing
   variables of C\&DW management and predict future behavior for both short
   and long-term decision making. However, there has been no systematic
   review of such SD applications to C\&DW management. The aim of this
   study is therefore to provide a systematic review of current
   applications of SD modeling to C\&DW management in order to identify
   research gaps and provide future related research opportunities. The
   novelty of this paper is that it is the first time that bibliometric
   visual analysis has been adopted to interpret visualized network maps of
   the co-occurrence of countries, keywords, and citations of selected
   articles on the application of SD modeling in C\&DW management. The SD
   modeling applications of these articles are comprehensively reviewed
   from the two main C\&D waste management perspective of the 3R principle
   and sustainability. The results reveal that more research effort has
   been made to reduce and recycle C\& DW than to reuse it, and that the
   economic and environmental performance of C\&DW attracts more attention
   than its social performance. The study suggests that to deepen and
   broaden the analysis of C\&DW management, future research could use
   hybrid models by combining SD with emerging techniques and tools, such
   as building information modeling, geographic information systems, and
   blockchain technology.},

Title = {A genetic algorithm tool for conceptual structural design with cost and
   embodied carbon optimization},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The conceptual design decisions have the largest influence on a building
   project's safety, value, and environmental impact; hence they are
   commonly assigned to a ``senior engineer'' to make use of his/her
   experience. However, the senior engineers can be biased towards
   solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from
   finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex
   inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering
   community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making
   method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact
   design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process;
   however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building
   Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project
   database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types)
   to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this
   article, we present the development and validation of a genetic
   algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II
   (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical
   and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design
   space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the
   site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored
   with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and
   foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per
   run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible
   solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that
   an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional
   conceptual design process. For future applications, the methodology
   presented in this paper is flexible to include more engineering
   materials (e.g., timber, masonry, structural glass), complex
   architectural forms and merge other disciplines in decision making
   (e.g., building physics construction management, fire safety).},

Abstract = {Professionals and researchers of the Architectural, Engineering \&
   Construction (AEC) industry are challenged by the increasing complexity
   of designing, constructing and operating a building. This typically
   requires close cooperation of actors having different backgrounds and
   interests. Traditionally, this cooperation happens in an ad-hoc way and
   information exchange occurs through conventional general-purpose
   communication channels, such as paper or email. This communication and
   collaboration process can be inadequate and inefficient, as it makes
   room for many different interpretations, mistakes and errors and can
   eventually lead to schedule and cost alterations. We present Green2.0, a
   system that tries to leverage advancements in building information
   modeling to facilitate the collaboration process. The system integrates
   energy-efficiency simulation tools, and methods for online social
   network analysis to enable a data-driven approach to building design,
   construction and operation. By sharing all information online, all
   project actors can access relevant information when they need so that
   everyone can work efficient together. The system aims to advance the
   current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the
   way that AEC professionals work together throughout a building's

Abstract = {A structure of data mining to discovery the inflow resources of product
   innovation is introduced in this paper. The structure incorporates data
   mining technique into the new product innovation and development phase.
   In order to predict product development and marketing trends easily, the
   product design architecture-based analysis method developed and
   presented in this article uses the decision tree model. Technologies of
   knowledge management such as data warehousing, data mining apply to
   product innovation that can gain a competitive advantage. Particularly,
   the extraction of hidden predictive information from large database by
   using data mining technique can identify valuable customers, predict
   future market, enhance product innovation efficiency and enable firms to
   make knowledge-driven decisions. Product design is a complex process,
   requiring many design factors and knowledge areas to be considered
   simultaneously. Enterprises are realizing how important it is to ``know
   what they know{''} and be able to make use of the vast amounts of
   knowledge in the recent years. When the life-cycle of a product is
   getting shorter and shorter, manufacturer and designer should reduce
   cost to keep competitive advantages. So, it is very important to develop
   effective methods and tools for product design. The research focuses on
   building the structure of data mining to fit a new product's innovative
   design and development process, and adopts the decision tree model to
   predict trends easily},

Abstract = {The construction industry wields significant influence in the economies
   of various countries. However, compared to sectors like manufacturing
   and aeronautics, it has lagged in terms of digitalization of processes
   and project management advancement. This study aims to explore how the
   integration of Lean principles, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and
   Project Lifecycle Management methodologies within an information system
   can enhance decision-making in construction project management as a
   complex environment. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to
   establish a conceptual framework and gather necessary information for
   designing an information system. The design was based on the viable
   systems model and the soft systems methodology, from a systemic
   perspective that encourages the synergistic interaction of these
   methodologies. The resulting abstract model would facilitate a
   comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness of these

Abstract = {Construction cost estimation, which is normally labor-intensive and
   error-prone, is one of the most important works in the architecture,
   engineering, construction, and facilities management industry during a
   project's lifecycle. With the development of information technology, it
   is expected that the efficiency and accuracy of cost estimation for
   tendering of building projects (TBP cost estimation for short hereafter)
   can be greatly improved if it can be carried out automatically based on
   the design results using building information modeling (BIM-based design
   results for short hereafter). One of the major obstacle to realize the
   automatic TBP cost estimation is the acquisition of the construction
   information (e.g. construction method, equipment), which are necessary
   for TBP cost estimation but often not included in the design results.
   This paper aims to establish an approach to identify and acquire the
   construction information systematically in order to facilitate the
   automatic TBP cost estimation based on BIM-based design results. First,
   the process of TBP cot estimation based on BQ method in China is
   introduced and the related specifications are classified. Then a typical
   specification for TBP cost estimation is analyzed to identify the
   construction information that are required in TBP cost estimation and a
   typical specification for the requirement on design detail fulfillment
   is analyzed to identify the construction information that can be
   obtained from the design result. Next, based on the above results, the
   construction information that need to be established during TBP cost
   estimation are highlighted and an approach to acquire them based on
   BIM-based design results are presented. Finally, the applicability of
   the approach is discussed. For simplicity, the scope for the analysis is
   confined to TBP cost estimation of concrete construction of reinforced
   concrete structures in this paper. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Practitioners' Concerns about Their Liability toward BIM Collaborative
   Digital Mockups: Case Study in Civil Engineering},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) involves the use of collaborative
   digital mock-ups of an asset to streamline design, building, and
   operation processes. Collaborative work and the use of an integrated
   digital mock-up offers many advantages but raises several problems
   regarding the liability of stakeholders in construction projects.
   Practitioners involved in the design process of a building (engineers
   and architects) practice very high-liability professions for which the
   use of a digital mock-up implies potentially high stakes. Although
   liability issues have been identified in the literature as a hindrance
   to BIM implementation, practitioners' concerns toward their liability
   have only barely been investigated. In this paper, we propose to explore
   engineers' concerns about their liability toward using BIM collaborative
   digital mock-ups with a case study in civil engineering. We documented
   these concerns through an exploratory study consisting of
   semi-structured interviews. The main contribution of the paper is
   therefore an organized list of concerns. These include: the alignment
   between their way of working and professional rules, the clarity of the
   assignment of liabilities, and the reliability of the digital mock-up.
   These stem from a liability risk that practitioners perceive because of
   uncertainty about liability allocation and uncertainty regarding the
   reliability of digital mock-ups. Our research work is part of an overall
   effort to understand the problems faced by practitioners when
   implementing new practices associated with BIM and to provide solutions.
   The results are therefore extensively discussed in order to identify
   hypotheses and avenues of work to address the identified concerns. The
   specific context (engineers, in Quebec) and the exploratory nature of
   the study implies that the results are not generalizable to a wider
   population. However, the identified concerns may be likely to emerge in
   similar context like high-liability professions involved in design
   stages of BIM projects. This paper is a very first step toward
   identifying these concerns in the construction sector and must be
   subject to future work.},

Title = {Using Knowledge Graphs to Unlock Practical Collection, Integration, and
   Audit of AI Accountability Information},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {74383-74411},
Abstract = {To enhance trustworthiness of AI systems, a number of solutions have
   been proposed to document how such systems are built and used. A key
   facet of realizing trust in AI is how to make such systems accountable -
   a challenging task, not least due to the lack of an agreed definition of
   accountability and differing perspectives on what information should be
   recorded and how it should be used (e.g., to inform audit). Information
   originates across the life cycle stages of an AI system and from a
   variety of sources (individuals, organizations, systems), raising
   numerous challenges around collection, management, and audit. In our
   previous work, we argued that semantic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are
   ideally suited to address those challenges and we presented an approach
   utilizing KGs to aid in the tasks of modelling, recording, viewing, and
   auditing accountability information related to the design stage of AI
   system development. Moreover, as KGs store data in a structured format
   understandable by both humans and machines, we argued that this approach
   provides new opportunities for building intelligent applications that
   facilitate and automate such tasks. In this paper, we expand our earlier
   work by reporting additional detailed requirements for knowledge
   representation and capture in the context of AI accountability; these
   extend the scope of our work beyond the design stage, to also include
   system implementation. Furthermore, we present the RAInS ontology which
   has been extended to satisfy these requirements. We evaluate our
   approach against three popular baseline frameworks, namely, Datasheets,
   Model Cards, and FactSheets, by comparing the range of information that
   can be captured by our KGs against these three frameworks. We
   demonstrate that our approach subsumes and extends the capabilities of
   the baseline frameworks and discuss how KGs can be used to integrate and
   enhance accountability information collection processes.},

Title = {A review of techno-economic data for road transportation fuels},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {11-26},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Worldwide, the road transport sector typically arises as one of the main
   sources of air pollutants due to its high energy intensity and the use
   of fossil fuels. Thus, governments and social agents work on the
   development and prospective planning of decarbonisation strategies
   oriented towards sustainable transport. In this regard, the increase in
   the use of alternative fuels is the recurrent approach to energy
   planning, e.g. through the promotion of electric vehicles, biofuels,
   natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, etc. However, there is a lack of
   comprehensive information on the techno-economic performance of
   production pathways for alternative fuels. The acquisition of robust
   techno-economic data is still a challenge for energy planners,
   modellers, analysts and policy-makers when building their prospective
   models to support decision-making processes. Hence, this article aims to
   fill this gap through a deep literature review including the most
   representative production routes for a wide range of road transportation
   fuels. This led to the development of datasets including investment
   costs, operating and maintenance costs, and transformation efficiencies
   for more than 40 production pathways. The techno-economic data presented
   in this work are expected to be especially useful to those energy actors
   interested in performing long-term studies on the transition to a
   sustainable transport system.},

Abstract = {The hybrid photovoltaic/battery energy storage system is a relevant
   pathway to generate low-cost green electricity. In the literature, cost
   optimization of these systems has been extensively used. However, the
   unpredictability of model and optimization methods input information,
   present the most drawbacks of optimal sizing of the system. Herein, an
   optimal sizing and evaluation framework are presented for an off-grid
   clean microgrid system solar/battery energy storage, to generate
   low-cost green electricity of rural building in China. The optimal
   sizing of the system is based on the hourly meteorological data and load
   demand during a year; with the lowest total life cycle cost as the
   objective function and the maximum reliability. A novel meta-heuristic
   tabu search algorithm is used in the solution process to obtain the
   optimal sizing of the system in terms of economics and reliability.
   Additionally, the variations of the optimal sizing of the system on the
   basis of different types of reliability index and tabu search
   parameters, such as initial solutions, neighborhood structure, number of
   run and iteration, is further comprehensively evaluated and
   investigated. The results prove that it is easier to find the optimal
   decision variables for the clean microgrid system with the optimal
   parameters of the algorithm.},

Abstract = {Many industries are applying various methods for optimizing energy use
   across the manufacturing life cycle. These methods are either
   physics-based or data-driven. Manufacturing systems generate a vast
   amount of data from operations and in simulations. Advances in data
   collection systems and data analytics (DA) tools have enabled the
   development of predictive analytics for energy prediction. Many of these
   prediction methods do not account for the uncertainty quantification-UQ
   (both in data and model). This work addresses the issue of uncertainty
   in predictive analytics.
   This work focuses on metal cutting processes and presents a Neural
   Networks (NNs) model to predict the required energy consumption during
   the manufacturing of a part on a milling machine. The model accounts for
   the uncertainty associated with both the manufacturing processes
   parameters, and assumptions in building the prediction model. To achieve
   this, prediction intervals are estimated instead of point predictions.
   In order to increase the ability to generalize over new datasets, an
   ensemble model of neural networks (NNs) is used, and the
   k-nearest-neighbors (k-nn) approach is applied to identify similar
   patterns between training and test datasets to increase the accuracy of
   the results by using local information from the closest patterns of the
   training sets. Case study results demonstrate consistency and high
   prediction precision as compared to the individual NNs of the ensembles.
   Moreover, it is shown that with advanced data collection and processing
   techniques, one can construct a prediction model to predict the energy
   consumption of a machine tool for machining a part with multiple
   operations and process parameters.},

Journal = {BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION},

Pages = {268-286},
Abstract = {How can progressive and significant change in the construction industry
   be achieved at a national policy level? Based on a series of
   international structured workshops of major stakeholders in five
   countries and further analysis, the connections between the
   driving/restraining forces to progress and the available actions are
   pinpointed. Stakeholders with the power to create momentum for change
   are identified and a general sequence of events is suggested that could
   progressively achieve significant progress. The analysis presented
   stresses the huge scope of construction at approximately 20\% of gross
   domestic product (when the use or occupancy phase is included), the
   importance, but difficulty, of creating a consensual national vision,
   the potential of `covenantal' as well as contractual relationships,
   together with the (currently) wasted opportunity to use information and
   knowledge progressively throughout the building life cycle. Longer-term
   implications for client-orientated training and education are
   introduced, together with the imperative of understanding and promoting
   the multiple, short- and long-term contributions that flow from
   construction. An over-arching `infinity' model is presented with two
   distinctive features: it is broadly conceptualized towards root causes
   and the dependence of each area on others is highlighted. As such, it
   seeks to place familiar subjects in a new challenging context and, in
   particular, the dynamic linkage is stressed between (internal) industry
   improvement and the perceived (external) societal value of this
   contribution.},

Title = {SUPPORTING BUILDING OWNERS AND FACILITY MANAGERS IN THE VALIDATION AND
   VISUALISATION OF ASSET INFORMATION MODELS (AIM) THROUGH OPEN STANDARDS
   AND OPEN TECHNOLOGIES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {436-455},
Abstract = {Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building
   projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes
   a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the
   requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b)
   validating project and asset data against the established requirements;
   and (c) visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed
   sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific
   asset/facility management functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The
   framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM),
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building
   Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability
   Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset Information Models (AIM) to
   fulfil the owner's requirements (Asset Information Requirements)
   throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is a data model that
   contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary)
   required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods
   are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their
   integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual
   environment.
   The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the
   validation of the various data sources against the client requirements,
   defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the
   visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an
   interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the
   capability of the framework to enable the definition ofAIR and the
   validation of the different AIM's data deliverables. The visualisation
   of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a
   maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and
   interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data
   sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial
   data.},

Abstract = {A Multi-purpose utility tunnel (MUT) is one of the civil infrastructures
   in urban areas, which accommodates several networks, such as electrical
   cables, gas, water, and sewer pipes, inside a tunnel. There are several
   benefits of MUTs compared to buried utilities. However, MUTs are not
   widely used at the time being due to the high initial construction cost
   and the need for coordination among utility owners. Building information
   modeling (BIM) is becoming the main coordination tool for building
   projects. BIM has been extended to civil infrastructures, such as
   bridges, roads, and sewer networks. However, BIM extension for MUT
   information modeling (MUTIM) is yet to be developed.
   This paper aims to investigate a method for extending BIM to MUT
   projects taking advantage of similar developments for other
   infrastructure systems. In addition, a systematic approach for MUTIM use
   cases is proposed. Five use cases of MUTIM were mentioned in this paper:
   (1) design review for checking compliance with standards and
   constructability; (2) 3D coordination for clash detection and
   resolution; (3) ergonomic design for human accessibility and comfort
   during construction, inspection and maintenance activities; (4) phase
   planning for construction and maintenance scheduling using 4D
   simulation; and (5) quantity takeoff for cost estimation. The first two
   MUTIM use cases are discussed in detail.
   A case study is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach. The presented MUTIM approach can improve MUT projects design
   and coordination efficiency, and reduce project cost, which are the main
   barriers for promoting MUTs.},

Abstract = {Smart construction has become popular because it improves the efficiency
   of various activities on construction sites. Data sharing is crucial for
   multiple stakeholders to achieve smart construction management. However,
   a unified framework is absent for data sharing between stakeholders.
   This study aims to develop a unified framework for data sharing in smart
   construction at the project level. A two-pronged design method is
   adopted to develop a unified framework for data sharing in smart
   construction using text analysis and semi-structured interviews. Then, a
   case study is incorporated for the application of the smart construction
   management framework. The unified framework for data sharing is
   developed as a five-layer architecture, consisting of the primary layers
   of perception, transmission, database, application, and presentation.
   The function modules of the unified framework include on-site
   monitoring, personnel, safety, quality, material, digital file,
   environment, and supervision, supported by the implementation of BIM,
   cloud computing, and IoT techniques. As illustrated in the case study,
   the construction period can be saved by 50 days and the cost can be
   saved by 4.2\% after implementing the proposed framework in the project.
   This study provides a benchmark for related studies on data management
   and collaborative innovation from various industries and stakeholders.
   Also, a useful framework has been developed by identifying the key
   elements, defining the primary functions, and developing the essential
   layers based on structural consistency.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a novel technological approach for
   enhancing the collective knowledge of communities of learners on the
   engineering of ontologies within a collaborative, open and socially
   constructed environment. The proposed technology aims at shaping
   information spaces into ontologies in a collaborative, communicative and
   learner-centered way during the ontology development life-cycle. The
   paper conjectures that such a collaborative environment can yield
   educational benefits, thus there is need to follow principles that apply
   in the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) paradigm. This
   work is mainly based on a collaborative and human-centered ontology
   engineering methodology and on a meta-ontology framework for developing
   ontologies, namely HCOME and HCOME-3O respectively. The integration of
   key technologies such as Semantic Wiki and Argumentation models with
   Ontology Engineering methodologies and tools serve as an enabler of
   learning spaces construction for different domain-specific information
   spaces in open settings. Inside these learning spaces innovative
   conceptualizations (both domain and development) are conceived,
   described by intertwined ontological meta-models following the HCOME-3O
   specifications for future reference and tutoring support. Such learning
   spaces support two types of ontology engineering courses: a) courses
   related to the know-how of shaping information spaces into ontologies
   (namely, the development knowledge) and b) courses related to the
   analysis of the domain itself (namely, the domain knowledge). The paper
   reports on the evaluation of the approach within a CSCL setting in
   Ontology Engineering, using the integrated set of tools and the
   framework that have been developed for the collaborative engineering of
   ontologies.},

Abstract = {The AEC industry is facing constant demand for resources, excessive raw
   materials' consumption, and waste generation. Now, the construction
   industry is responsible for about 50\% of the global solid waste, which
   negatively impacts the environment. However, construction techniques and
   building practices have been advanced over the years with an increased
   interest in sustainability, especially in energy conservation and in
   adopting the Industrial Production layer of Construction 4.0 (i.e.,
   modular prefabrication, 3D concrete printing, and BIM). The concept of
   circular economy (CE) has also been identified as a potential solution
   to achieve sustainability in building construction through the design,
   construction, and deconstruction processes that enhance waste management
   based on the framework that is related to reducing, reusing, and
   recycling. Additionally, geospatial data complements advanced digital
   technologies by providing a collaborative platform that supports CE as a
   practical approach to sustainability. Thus, this study will provide a
   straightforward methodology for developing a BIM-GIS sustainable design
   model that integrates circular economy's concept to enhance construction
   sustainability in order to minimize lifecycle waste based on various
   construction methods (i.e., conventional, modular, and 3D printing). The
   proposed model integrates tools and data for the evaluation and planning
   of construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) management strategies at
   the design stage, including quantifying the wasted materials, selecting
   the waste handling equipment, and estimating the associated costs with
   the loading and hauling of waste at the various stages of a project. The
   proposed model will provide designers with the ability to evaluate the
   construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) during the design of
   buildings based on their different construction methods at the early
   stage of design using the design for deconstruction (DfD) concept;
   sustainable construction methods; and deconstruction process for waste
   management, which will lead to a suitable construction method.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development is first defined as development that satisfies
   the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
   generations to satisfy theirs. Sustainable development is possible if
   conditions of respect for the environment, preventing the exhaustion of
   natural resources and preserving the overall balance, are fulfilled. The
   necessity of the development and maintenance of habitats also
   emphasized. Construction processes have important role in creation of
   built environment and their impacts have to be measured as construction
   contributes to air pollution, land use and contamination, usage of
   resources, water and materials depletion, water pollution, impacts on
   human health, and climate change. Previous (own) research revealed, that
   the key categories of Web of Science, which encompass the research on
   the sustainable built environment, cover construction and building
   technologies, environmental science and studies, and civil engineering.
   The article presents a review of the literature on efforts to harmonize
   the construction processes, which was made on the basis of the Web of
   Science Core Collection database. The analysis of the number of
   publications was made according to years of publication and research
   areas. To honour the contribution made by Prof Oleg Kaplinski in the
   field of Sustainable Development and Decision-Making, and to commemorate
   his 75th anniversary, this article also highlights his academic career

Title = {Analysis of negative impacts of BIM-enabled information transparency on

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) generates accurate information in an
   explicit way and allows project stakeholders to easily access
   information of various types, greatly promoting information transparency
   during the lifecycle of a facility. Information transparency brings a
   number of benefits but potentially influences contractors' interests by
   weakening their core competencies or preventing some unethical but
   lucrative practices from occurring. This may impede the extensive
   application of BIM. However, it still lacks a comprehensive research on
   this. This research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
   negative impact of BIM-enabled information transparency on contractors'
   interests and further on BIM adoption by conducting an anonymous
   questionnaire survey. The results show that 1) the transparency of
   construction techniques and methods can impair contractors' interests in
   the long run, but relevant information is almost not disclosed by BIM so
   far; 2) the transparency of construction resource, cost and time has an
   instant and direct impact on contractors' interests, but only
   resource-and-cost-related unethical practices are influenced by BIM; and
   3) the transparency of construction quality and safety has little impact
   on contractors' interests and relevant unethical practices are almost
   not influenced by BIM. Besides, contractors are reluctant to share
   information or use BIM with owners, thus further impeding BIM adoption.
   Based on these results, this research also presents some implications
   for the improvement of current working processes among stakeholders in
   the BIM context to protect contractors' core competencies and prevent
   unethical practices. These findings are expected to promote the
   extensive use of BIM in the construction industry.},

Title = {Embodied Carbon and Embodied Energy Scenarios in the Built Environment.
   Computational Design Meets EPDs},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article aims to study the political, environmental and economic
   factors in contemporary society that influence new approaches and
   decision making in design in terms of carbon emissions and energy
   employment. These issues are increasingly influencing political decision
   making and public policy throughout every aspect of society, including
   the design practice. Managing this kind of complexity means adopting new
   forms of collaboration, methodologies and tools, knowledge and
   technology sharing. The article aims to narrate a PhD research
   experience grounded in academy-industry collaboration and aimed at
   creating a digital methodology for impact evaluation and investment
   planning. In particular, the digital methodology focuses on responding
   to international public policy for the sustainable growth of cities, in
   terms of footprint and energy demand, by including a holistic view of
   the design process made possible by the use of life-cycle assessment
   (LCA) procedures. To simplify the calculation, the methodology focuses
   on the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) data rather than the
   entire LCA. The EPD is a document that describes the environmental
   impacts linked to the production of a specific quantity of product or
   service. The objective was not to create another evaluation method but
   to employ the EPD results in combination with parametric and
   computational procedures. The integration of those procedures by using
   visual programming and scripting allowed the calculation of Embodied
   Carbon and Embodied Energy and created a user-friendly interface to
   query the results. The output obtained included automatic and dynamic
   diagrams able to identify impact scenarios in terms of CO2 emissions and
   MJ of embodied energy after the conceptual design stage. The strategic
   use of the charts lies in their potential to simulate impact conditions
   and, therefore, in the chance to create sustainable transformation
   scenarios in the early stages of design. At this point, the influence on
   choices is at its highest, and the costs are low. Moreover, the
   methodology represents a platform of collaboration that potentially
   increases the level of interaction between the actors of the
   construction process with the consequent improvement in design quality.
   In conclusion, building the design methodology and testing its
   performance within a specific sociotechnical context was important in
   critically evaluating certain topics, for example, the recent European
   strategies on new technology to reach sustainable objectives, the role
   of digital tools in proposing solutions towards contemporary social
   issues, the birth of new forms of partnership and collaboration and the
   new possibilities coming from digital evaluation approaches.},

Abstract = {The housing industry faces challenges in product data management,
   resulting in negative effects on productivity, efficiency, and quality.
   The purpose of the study presented in this paper is to elaborate on
   requirements and functions of a support system to mitigate challenges
   with product data management in the wooden single-family house industry.
   As a support system, a pilot product lifecycle management (PLM) system
   was developed with functions to fulfill the requirements. The support
   system was installed and tested in a real -world setting, a wooden
   single-family house company, Company T. The paper contributes with the
   insights that a PLM system for industrialized house building can be
   developed, fulfilling the requirements in this specific industry. The
   functions developed were perceived to have value and could, for Company
   T, mitigate their challenges with product data management. The support
   system facilitate integration between the pilot PLM system, the building
   information modeling tool and the enterprise resource planning system at
   Company T. Based on the study carried out, the paper concludes that a
   PLM system is feasible, and that it might be a way to mitigate

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Waste from the construction sector poses huge challenges for sustainable
   waste management. This is not only due to the vast amount of waste
   produced in construction and demolition activities, but also due to
   pollutants potentially contained in these products. Subject to these
   conditions, waste management must ensure recovery of as many resources
   as possible, while making sure to keep material loops clean. This
   demanding task requires more knowledge about the existing building stock
   and an adaptation of current demolition processes. Innovative
   technologies, such as Building Information Modelling, or modern
   frameworks, such as Geographic Information Systems, offer a high
   potential to synoptically provide stock material information for future
   demolition activities for individual objects to be deconstructed as well
   as for whole cities as a basis for managing the anthropogenic stock and
   potential urban mining. Suitable methods of data collection allow for
   acquiring the desired input for the generation of building stock models
   enriched with demolition-related information. With the latter, selective
   deconstruction strategies as well as appropriate waste stream routing
   agendas can be planned and executed, thereby securing safety at work
   during the demolition process itself and a waste stream routing
   according to the waste hierarchy. This review article gives an overview
   of currently deployed building material assessment tools (data capture
   and visualisation), both a prerequisite for improved information on
   materials and geometry (and thereby mass/volume). In addition, this
   article describes workflows employable for the purpose of urban mining
   in end-of-life buildings, of which one holistic approach will be
   described in depth.},

Title = {An Urban Renewal Design Method Based on Carbon Emissions and Carbon Sink
   Calculations: A Case Study on an Environmental Improvement Project in
   the Suzhou Industrial Investment Science and Technology Park},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the process of urban renewal, the high carbon emissions caused by
   pollution from construction waste and the consumption of materials and
   energy via ``demolition and construction{''} present significant
   problems. Calculating carbon emissions and sinks is a prerequisite to
   carving out a low-carbon path via urban renewal. In this paper, we take
   an environmental improvement project in the Suzhou Industrial Investment
   Science and Technology Park as an example. Under the framework of the
   entire life cycle, we define the ``renewal phase{''}, which includes
   ``demolition{''} and ``construction{''}, as the calculation boundary,
   and use the emission coefficient method as the primary calculation
   approach to assess carbon emissions and sinks. We construct a
   design-oriented carbon revenue and expenditure estimation system based
   on the BIM model. After its application in empirical cases, the results
   show the following: (1) The building carbon emissions of Scheme A are
   342 t higher than those of Scheme B, due to the fact that the
   ``demolition and construction{''} works in the former increased by 6000
   m2 compared to the latter. (2) The landscape carbon emissions of Scheme
   B are 269 t higher than those of Scheme A, due to the addition of a 2500
   m2 reinforced concrete overhead walking platform. (3) The annual carbon
   sink of Scheme A is six times higher than that of Scheme B, due to the
   fact that the number of trees and shrubs in the former is five-to-six
   times greater than in the latter. The number of trees planted plays a
   decisive role in enhancing the carbon sink benefit. (4) In the year
   during which the renewal project was implemented, the difference in
   carbon emissions between Scheme A and Scheme B was 72.9 t. By the 16th
   year, the difference in carbon emissions between the two schemes
   approached zero, and the carbon reduction advantages of Scheme A became
   more pronounced over the entire life cycle thereafter. Finally, this
   article summarizes four low-carbon design strategies for industrial park
   renewal projects: rational construction and demolition,
   three-dimensional parking, low-carbon materials, and plant carbon
   sequestration. In the context of inventory renewal, this article makes a
   significant contribution in terms of carbon footprint control and the
   ``dual-carbon{''} goal.},

Title = {Modeling, performance analysis and economic feasibility of a
   mirror-augmented photovoltaic system},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {276-286},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the last years, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have had great
   impetus with research and demonstration projects, both in Italy and
   other European countries. The main problems with solar PV are the cost
   of solar electricity, which is still higher compared with other
   renewables (such as wind or biomass), due to the cost of
   semi-conductors, and the low conversion efficiency. However, PV panel
   prices are rapidly decreasing benefiting from favorable economies of
   scale. For instance, according to the Energy Information Administration
   (ETA) the US average levelized costs for plants entering service in the
   2018 should be 144.3\$/MW h for solar PV, whereas 111.0\$/MW h for
   biomass and 86.6\$/MW h for wind (Levelized Cost of New Generation
   Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook, 2013). In order to increase the
   electric yield of PV modules (which can be even doubled with respect to
   constant tilt configurations), without significantly increasing the
   system costs, it was decided to consider the addition of inclined
   mirrors at both sides of the PV modules, so as to deflect more solar
   rays towards them, as in Mirror-Augmented Photovoltaic (MAPV) systems.
   The system preserves its constructive simplicity with commercial flat PV
   modules even though dual axis tracker must be implemented, since MAPV
   systems harness mainly the direct radiation. The performance analysis of
   MAPV systems starts from the calculation of the global irradiation on
   the surface of the PV module which is a sum of the direct sunlight on it
   and the irradiation reflected by the mirrors. A mathematical model of a
   MAPV system is presented, which takes into account not only the increase
   of direct (or beam) radiation, due to the mirrors, but also the
   reduction of both the diffuse and reflected radiations due to the
   shadowing effect of the flat mirrors. In particular, under an isotropic
   sky assumption, a simplified analytical expression, applicable in the
   case of MAPV systems, for the sky-view factor has been developed. The
   deterioration in the performance of the PV system as a result of the
   increasing cell temperature with radiation augmentation due to mirrors
   has been also evaluated. Moreover, in order to provide a more realistic
   view of the process, the energy analysis is accompanied by the exergy
   analysis. Finally, in order to analyse the economics of MAPV systems,
   Net Present Value, Discounted Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return
   and Life-Cycle Costs, have been considered and compared with both a
   constant tilt building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and a
   system with a dual axis tracker. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Sustainability assessment model for mass housing's interior
   rehabilitation and its validation to Ekbatan, Iran},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Mass housing (MH) buildings from the `60s to the `80s, after decades of
   continuous use and inadequate maintenance, cause several sustainability
   issues and need rehabilitation. Most current conventional rehabilitation
   approaches have long been criticized because they consider neither
   sustainability requirements nor contemporary building standards. In this
   regard, the assessment and selection of suitable approaches for
   rehabilitating MH interiors, from a holistic sustainability viewpoint,
   is a crucial issue that faces several challenges since this is a
   multidisciplinary and multi-criteria process. On this subject, the
   present study develops a novel MCDM model based on the MIVES and Delphi
   methods for the holistic sustainability assessment of MHs' interior
   rehabilitation considering involved stakeholders' preferences. This
   MIVES-Delphi model relies on a comprehensive literature review, experts'
   seminars, on-site surveying, LCA, BIM, user/expertbased questionnaires,
   bias reduction, and sensitivity analysis. The model was first applied in
   the Ekbatan MH case study, the largest MH in Iran, to assess the
   sustainability of four different interior rehabilitation scenarios,
   including three common rehabilitation scenarios plus an innovative one.
   Consequently, the new model was validated, and the most sustainable
   scenario was selected. The specific results regarding these scenarios'
   evaluation disclosed that none of the common rehabilitation scenarios
   could either meet the minimum sustainability target value or serve as
   proper solutions for MH's interior rehabilitation. Contrarily, the
   fourth scenario, with a global sustainability index of 0.71, could meet
   the standard minimum target. This outcome provides a possibility for
   innovative rehabilitation processes to have positive effects on
   increasing the sustainability performance in MH buildings.},

Abstract = {Arch bridges made of natural stone masonry nowadays rank among the
   oldest, structures still in service in the road and railroad
   infrastructure. Some of them with ages of more than 100 years, represent
   a historically very valuable building fabric. In Austria's railroad
   network alone there are around 1,000 arch bridges still in operation. In
   whole Europe the estimated number of masonry railroad bridges amounts to
   70,000. Nowadays increasingly more attention is paid to the maintenance
   and rehabilitation of existing arch bridges than on their
   reconstruction, as a result of financial reasons as well as monument
   conservation aspects. Since those bridges usually have been projected
   for very different loads, assessments concerning the current bearing
   capacity and the future utilization are required. A recalculation with
   conventional calculation methods is often insufficient as results can
   considerably deviate from the actual load capacity due to various
   influencing factors. The challenge therefore is to find and verify more
   accurate methods to determine the actual condition of such arch bridges.
   A point of interest is the combination of finite element modeling
   strategies of masonry with inspection and monitoring strategies of
   existing structures. Inspections enable the detection of ``damage{''},
   whereby damage is defined as changes in material as well as geometric
   properties of a structure. The applications of monitoring systems allow
   a continuous observation of a system over time. In case of long term
   observations, the output of this process is a periodically updated
   information regarding the ability of the structure to perform its tasks.
   Within the proposed contribution a generally valid methodology for the
   performance and lifetime assessment of masonry arch bridges based on
   nonlinear finite element analysis and monitoring data will be presented.
   Further two different approaches for the assessment of extreme values
   and probability of failure will be discussed. The two approaches will be
   applied to a railroad arch bridge located in Austria.},

Title = {Deconstruction project planning of existing buildings based on automated
   acquisition and reconstruction of building information},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {226-245},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {During their lifecycles, buildings are changed and adapted to the
   requirements of generations of users, residents and proprietaries over
   several decades. At the end of their life time, buildings undergo either
   retrofit or deconstruction (and replacement) processes. And,
   modifications and deviations of the original building structure,
   equipment and fittings as well as the deterioration and contamination of
   buildings are often not well documented or only available in an outdated
   and unstructured way. Thus, in many existing buildings, incomplete,
   obsolete or fragmented building information is predominating and
   hampering retrofit and deconstruction project planning.
   To plan change or deconstruction measures in existing buildings,
   buildings are audited manually or with stationary laser scans which
   requires great effort of skilled staff and expensive equipment.
   Furthermore, current building information models or deconstruction
   planning systems are often not able to deal with incomplete building
   information as it occurs in existing buildings.
   We develop a combined system named ResourceApp of a hardware sensor with
   software modules for building information acquisition, 3D
   reconstruction, object detection, building inventory generation and
   optimized project planning. The mobile and wearable system enables
   planner, experts or decision makers to inspect a building and at the
   same time record, analyze, reconstruct and store the building digitally.
   For this purpose, a Kinect sensor acquires point clouds and developed
   algorithms analyze them in real-time to detect construction elements.
   From this information, a 3D building model and building inventory is
   automatically derived. Then, the generated building reconstruction
   information is used for optimized project planning with a solution
   algorithm of the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling
   problem (MRCPSP) at hand.
   In contrast to existing approaches, the system allows mobile building
   recording during building walkthrough, real-time reconstruction and
   object detection. And, based on the automatically captured and processed
   building conditions by sensor data, the system performs an integrated
   project planning of the building deconstruction with available resources
   and the required decontamination and deconstruction activities.
   Furthermore, it optimizes time and cost considering secondary raw
   material recovery, usage of renewable resources, staff qualification,
   onsite logistics, material storage and recycling options.
   Results from field tests on acquisition, reconstruction and
   deconstruction planning are presented and discussed in an extensive
   non-residential case study. The case study shows that the building
   inventory masses are quite well approximated and project planning works
   well based on the chosen methods. Nevertheless, future testing and
   parameter adjustment for the automated data processing is needed and
   will further improve the systems' quality, effectiveness and accuracy.
   Future research and application areas are seen in the quantification and
   analysis of the effects of missing data, the integration of material
   classification and sampling sensors into the system, the system
   connection to Building Information Modelling (BIM) software via a
   respective interface and the transfer and extension to retrofit project
   planning.},

Title = {A Terrestrial LiDAR-Based Detection of Shape Deformation for Maintenance
   of Bridge Structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {145},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {A terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can be used to
   construct the building information modeling as well as to measure shape
   deformation that varies with time or load during or after construction.
   Thus, the measurement can be utilized for risk management and the
   completion inspection during and after construction, and for life
   cycling cost analysis to decide the reconstruction of existing
   structure. In this regard, this paper presents a practical feasibility
   study of a shape information model to monitor deformation or deflection
   of bridge structures with data loss minimization and computational
   efficiency. The 3D position information of the structure was obtained
   using terrestrial laser scanning, and the octree data structure was used
   for efficient processing of the acquired large-scale scan data. To
   accomplish this, we constructed a shape information model which means a
   3D visualization process on the basis of the octree algorithm, which
   converts point cloud data via voxel to the improved octree structure by
   efficient management of empty nodes. First, laser scanning was carried
   out on a steel box-girder bridge (Bridge 1) and a steel I-girder bridge
   (Bridge 2), and the data for 35.4x29.2x6.89 m3 and 9.3x5.4x1.8 m3 in
   each test-bed area were compressed from 158.72 to 13.05 MB with 91.7\%
   reduction for the Bridge 1 and from 21.5 to 2.3 MB with 89.3\% for the
   Bridge 2. As a next step, the shape information model was applied to the
   deflection estimation of another steel box girder bridge in service
   (Bridge 3) associated with the octree space division. The results showed
   the reasonable deflection values in comparison with the LVDT
   measurement. The proposed approach can provide useful information for
   effective condition evaluation and maintenance of bridge structures.},

Abstract = {Capability is broadly agreed to mean the capacity or ability to achieve
   an effect. In military circles, effect is more precisely defined as
   desired operational effect. This is to ensure that capability has a
   purpose. A certain quantifiable usefulness that allows capabilities to
   be deconstructed, costed, compared and developed. Capability
   development, certainly within the well-recognised capability life cycle
   model used in various militaries and business, is founded on the premise
   that a capability is measurable. They are hard, tangible and generally
   easily recognised. But what about the capabilities that are not obvious?
   How do we describe those capabilities that generate tangible effects
   however are not themselves directly quantifiable?
   Quantifiable hard capabilities are simple enough to understand, though
   perhaps complicated to develop. When designing and developing hard
   capabilities, organisations are travelling down a well-travelled highway
   lined with information, models, exemplars and warnings. A model commonly
   used to describe the development of capability, to achieve a specific
   effect, describes the Fundamental Inputs to Capability (FIC). FICs are
   used to describe the building blocks required for specific capabilities
   and, while they vary slightly between models, generally include people,
   organisational design, facilities, support structures, other major
   systems, common or collective training and policies. The use of these
   labels is a convenient way to understand the important building blocks
   however are FICs common across all types of capabilities?
   Soft capability though, whilst intuitively understood by many, is not
   well defined in current literature. This paper seeks to present a
   synthesised understanding of soft capability from a range of subject
   matter experts in capability development. The study explored the
   characteristics, inputs and examples of soft capability as understood by
   experts in the field. The results of the research demonstrate that soft
   capability is different to other capability types commonly referred to
   in literature. The conclusion is that soft capability is a valid
   capability type that has, to date, been ignored in literature.},

Abstract = {The requirements imposed by AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction)
   projects with regard to data storage and execution, on-demand data
   sharing and complexity on building simulations have led to utilising
   novel computing techniques. In detail, these requirements refer to
   storing the large amounts of data that the AEC industry generates from
   building schematics to associated data derived from different
   contractors that are involved at various stages of the building
   lifecycle; or running simulations on building models (such as energy
   efficiency, environmental impact \& occupancy simulations). Creating
   such a computing infrastructure to support operations deriving from
   various AEC projects can be challenging due to the complexity of
   workflows, distributed nature of the data and diversity of roles,
   profiles and location of the users.
   Federated clouds have provided the means to create a distributed
   environment that can support multiple individuals and organisations to
   work collaboratively. In this study we present how multi-site
   construction projects can be coordinated by the use of federated clouds
   where the interacting parties are represented by AEC industry
   organisations. We show how coordination can support (a) data sharing and
   interoperability using a multi-vendor Cloud environment and (b) process
   interoperability based on various stakeholders involved in the AEC
   project lifecycle. We develop a framework that facilitates project
   coordination with associated ``issue status{''} implications and
   validate our outcome in a real construction project.},

Title = {An indoor air quality evaluation in a residential retrofit project using
   spray polyurethane foam},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {363-375},
Abstract = {Understanding of indoor air quality (IAQ) during and after spray
   polyurethane foam (SPF) application is essential to protect the health
   of both workers and building occupants. Previous efforts such as field
   monitoring, micro-chamber/spray booth emission studies, and
   fate/transport modeling have been conducted to understand the chemical
   exposure of SPF and guide risk mitigation strategies. However, each type
   of research has its limitation and can only reveal partial information
   on the relationship between SPF and IAQ. A comprehensive study is truly
   needed to integrate the experimental design and analytical testing
   methods in the field/chamber studies with the mathematical tools
   employed in the modeling studies. This study aims to bridge this gap and
   provide a more comprehensive understanding on the impact of SPF to IAQ.
   The field sampling plan of this research aims to evaluate the airborne
   concentrations of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), formaldehyde,
   acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, tris(1-chlor-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP),
   trans-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (Solstice (TM)), and airborne
   particles. Modifications to existing MDI sampling and analytical methods
   were made so that level of quantification was improved. In addition, key
   fate and transport modeling input parameters such as air changes per
   hour and airborne particle size distribution were measured. More
   importantly, TCPP accumulation onto materials was evaluated, which is
   important to study the fate and transport of semi-volatile organic
   compounds. The IAQ results showed that after spray application was
   completed in the entire building, airborne concentrations decreased for
   all chemicals monitored. However, it is our recommendation that during
   SPF application, no one should return to the application site without
   proper personal protection equipment as long as there are active spray
   activities in the building. The comparison between this field study and
   a recent chamber study proved surface sorption and particle deposition
   is an important factor in determining the fate of airborne TCPP. The
   study also suggests the need for further evaluation by employing
   mathematical models, proving the data generated in this work as
   informative to industry and the broader scientific community.},

Title = {Analysis of Geometric Characteristics of Cracks and Delamination in
   Aerated Concrete Products Using Convolutional Neural Networks},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming a
   strategic vector for the development of companies in the construction
   sector. The introduction of ``smart solutions{''} at all stages of the
   life cycle of building materials, products and structures is observed
   everywhere. Among the variety of applications of AI methods, a special
   place is occupied by the development of the theory and technology of
   creating artificial systems that process information from images
   obtained during construction monitoring of the structural state of
   objects. This paper discusses the process of developing an innovative
   method for analyzing the presence of cracks that arose after applying a
   load and delamination as a result of the technological process, followed
   by estimating the length of cracks and delamination using convolutional
   neural networks (CNN) when assessing the condition of aerated concrete
   products. The application of four models of convolutional neural
   networks in solving a problem in the field of construction flaw
   detection using computer vision is shown; the models are based on the
   U-Net and LinkNet architecture. These solutions are able to detect
   changes in the structure of the material, which may indicate the
   presence of a defect. The developed intelligent models make it possible
   to segment cracks and delamination and calculate their lengths using the
   author's SCALE technique. It was found that the best segmentation
   quality was shown by a model based on the LinkNet architecture with
   static augmentation: precision = 0.73, recall = 0.80, F1 = 0.73 and IoU
   = 0.84. The use of the considered algorithms for segmentation and
   analysis of cracks and delamination in aerated concrete products using
   various convolutional neural network architectures makes it possible to
   improve the quality management process in the production of building
   materials, products and structures.},

Title = {Minimum Viable Model (MVM) Methodology for Integration of Agile Methods
   into Operational Simulation of Logistics},
Journal = {LOGISTICS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Logistics problems involve a large number of complexities,
   which makes the development of models challenging. While computer
   simulation models are developed for addressing complexities, it is
   essential to ensure that the necessary operational behaviours are
   captured, and that the architecture of the model is suitable to
   represent them. The early stage of simulation modelling, known as
   conceptual modelling (CM), is thus dependent on successfully extracting
   tacit operational knowledge and avoiding misunderstanding between the
   client (customer of the model) and simulation analyst. Objective: This
   paper developed a methodology for managing the knowledge-acquisition
   process needed to create a sufficient simulation model at the early or
   the CM stage to ensure the correctness of operation representation.
   Methods: A minimum viable model (MVM) methodology was proposed with five
   principles relevant to CM: iterative development, embedded
   communication, soliciting tacit knowledge, interactive face validity,
   and a sufficient model. The method was validated by a case study of
   freight operations, and the results were encouraging. Conclusions: The
   MVM method improved the architecture of the simulation model through
   eliciting tacit knowledge and clearing up communication
   misunderstandings. It also helped shape the architecture of the model
   towards the features most appreciated by the client, and features not
   needed in the model. Originality: The novel contribution of this work is
   the presentation of a method for eliciting tacit information from
   industrial clients, and building a minimally sufficient simulation model
   at the early modelling stage. The framework is demonstrated for
   logistics operations, though the principles may benefit simulation
   practitioners more generally.},

Title = {Digitally enabled modular construction for promoting modular components
   reuse: A UK view},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The UK construction sector is facing multiple challenges associated with
   low productivity, unreliable project delivery, poor performance, skilled
   labour shortages, and resource inefficiency. To address these challenges
   the UK Government and the construction industry have been promoting
   modular construction; a method that can improve efficiency and
   productivity in the construction sector via the prefabrication of
   volumetric elements or structural components of a building off-site and
   their assembly on-site. In this study we highlight that while modular
   construction can help deliver sustainability credentials in the entire
   construction value chain, at present the sector's activities are
   concentrated on using modular construction to improve resource
   efficiency upstream of the construction value chain, i.e. at the design,
   manufacture and construction. This appears to be divorced from the need
   to promote resource efficiency and productivity at the stages occurring
   downstream (i.e., disassembly and end-of-life management) of the
   construction value chain. Such divergence could hamper construction
   industry's efforts to reduce its environmental and economic impacts in
   the future, and points to the need of an integrated, holistic approach
   to improving the sustainability of the sector. To support our argument,
   we provide an overview of the current state of modular construction in
   the UK, and outline key obstacles in rolling out modular construction's
   mainstream use. We posit that modular construction presents an
   opportunity to integrate upstream with downstream construction practices
   and achieve sustainability in the entire construction sector, and
   suggest that the development of a digitally enabled modular
   construction, whereby smart technologies are combined with modular
   construction, could be instrumental in supporting this vision. A smart,
   modular construction regime can operationalise the collection and
   storage of components' lifecycle information, and help the sector build
   the capabilities needed to support the maintenance, recovery and reuse
   of modular components, and reduction of waste. For this to take
   precedence it is imperative to think of the `end' right at the beginning
   of the design stage, and foster an improved collaboration between all
   stakeholders involved in the construction value chain.},

Abstract = {Organisations and/or disciplines in Building and Construction projects
   are usually working in their own design and engineering environments and
   using their own Building Information Models (BIM). The discipline models
   are merged into a project BIM which is mainly used to check for
   interferences or other flaw geometrical interface conditions. The
   checking is based on the skills and experience of a few individuals and
   usually performed as a verification afterwards. An important assumption
   is that many non-conformances can be avoided or at least detected easier
   and earlier in the project if knowledge and information between the
   disciplines is shared and all designers and engineers are working on an
   integral product model right in the primary process. The result will be
   based on the experience and skills of many collaborating individuals in
   different disciplines and checked during execution of the individual
   tasks. Knowledge, i.e. tacit knowledge, is what is in people's minds.
   This knowledge has to be captured and transformed into explicit
   knowledge so it can be used by many others. This knowledge, for example
   documented in models, drawings or instructions, has to be integrated
   with the product data of the related physical objects and kept up to
   date. Otherwise it will be lost. Also explicit knowledge on processes
   and procedures has to be stored and maintained. The paper explores the
   relationships between the available knowledge in the project (people),
   the use of an integral product model in the primary process or a BIM
   (both repositories) and the management of all product lifecycle
   information (Configuration Management). Known principles like
   Collaborative Engineering and Concurrent Engineering are discussed as
   methods to share knowledge. They are also used to assure the highest
   reachable level of quality, prevent failure costs and bring value added
   changes earlier in the project to save time and costs. Attention is paid
   to the role of ICT, e. g. product lifecycle management (PLM) and social
   media. The textbook of Dalkir 2011{[}2], an acknowledged guru on
   Knowledge Management, is used to cover the discipline of Knowledge
   Management. Several further references are taken from Dalkir{[}2]. The
   publication of Anumba{[}1] is studied for more details of Knowledge
   Management in Building and Construction.},

Title = {Requirements for cloud-based BIM governance solutions to facilitate team
   collaboration in construction projects},
Journal = {REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Construction projects involve multidisciplinary and multi-actor
   collaborations that generate massive amounts of data over their
   lifecycle. Data are often sensitive and embody rights, ownership, and
   intellectual property of the creator. Managing project information
   raises concerns about security, inconsistency, and loss of data.
   Conventional approach of dealing with the complexities of data
   management involves the adoption of BIM-based solutions that lack
   suitable means for the governance of collaboration, and access and
   archival of managed data. To overcome the limitations of BIM,
   cloud-based governance solutions have been suggested as a way forward.
   However, there is a lack of understanding of construction Information
   and Communication Technology (ICT) practices from the perspectives of
   data management and governance. This paper aims to fill this gap: first,
   by exploring barriers related to BIM adoption and collaboration
   practices, in particular, issues related to data management and
   governance that can potentially be ameliorated with cloud technologies,
   and second, by identifying key requirements for cloud-based BIM
   governance solutions. A structured questionnaire was conducted among
   informed construction practitioners in this study. The findings reveal
   several barriers to BIM adoption alongside ICT and collaboration issues
   with an urgent need to develop a BIM governance solution underpinned by
   cloud technology. Further, a number of important requirements for
   developing BIM governance solutions have been identified.},

Title = {A Data Processing Methodology to Analyze Construction and Demolition
   Dynamics in the European Metropolis of Lille, France},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the absence of industry data, organisms, and researchers leverage
   free and available data, specifically building and demolition permits.
   Geospatial processing is essential to integrate information from various
   files into a single GIS layer containing all relevant attributes for
   analysis. This article proposes a Geographic Information System (GIS)
   processing model aimed at monitoring construction and demolition
   dynamics in the European metropolis of Lille to quantify the urban
   production of mineral waste from buildings. Author methodology is based
   on that that the deposit potential can be analyzed using the observation
   of the spatiotemporal dynamics of building and demolition permits. The
   results demonstrate that combining construction and demolition (C\&D)
   permits with other GIS layers allows us to produce data to quantify
   demolition surfaces per year in a given French area. The applicability
   of this methodology extends to all French regions, providing insights
   into the impact of crises on deconstruction activities and C\&D waste
   generation. The study focuses on C\&D French public data bases (French
   government and European Metropolis of Lille) attributed to the region
   (area) of the European Metropolis of Lille (MEL) between 2013 and 2022.
   Some data for 2022 were incomplete due to ongoing treatment, emphasizing
   the importance of understanding the dynamics of demolition rates or
   surfaces to identify data gaps or errors. Historical trajectories of
   C\&D permits were quantified and analyzed, revealing over 21,000 permits
   granted from 2013 to 2022, categorized by site type (new construction,
   rehabilitations, prior declarations, and demolitions). Construction
   sites during this period covered approximately 3,345,948 m2,
   constituting 20\% of the MEL's building stock, while demolition sites
   amounted to 1,977,911 m2, equivalent to 5\% of the total area of
   buildings in the metropolis. Employing GIS allowed for a spatial
   analysis, visualizing data by municipality, urban fabric, and year. The
   analysis highlighted territories with high and low potential for
   demolition and construction, as well as the most impacted urban fabrics
   and dynamic periods. The article discusses potential crisis impacts
   (e.g., COVID-19 or economic downturns) and the implications of
   incomplete data. Finally, the study demonstrates how these findings can
   be utilized to quantify C\&D waste, leveraging GIS and the production
   rate calculation method (GRC).},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the state of engineering and
   design research for sustainable construction. It aims to report the
   current status and future trends within this dynamic field, combining
   econometric and content analysis using the Bibliometrix R encapsulation
   tool. This study reviewed academic journals using bibliometric analysis.
   We selected articles by searching the Scopus database. Primarily
   relevant articles were identified and screened. The dataset comprised a
   substantial compilation of 731 journal articles from 278 sources
   published between January 2000 and June 2023, which formed the basis of
   the in-depth analysis. The importance of sustainable construction is
   gradually gaining more attention, and engineering and design are the
   significant phases of construction. This research identifies that
   sustainable construction is nothing in isolation; instead, it warrants
   the holistic integration of multiple factors, as illustrated in the
   Sankey diagram. Recycling, durability, life cycle assessment, innovative
   materials, and energy efficiency have emerged as central themes,
   reflecting global concern to enhance sustainability, reduce
   environmental impacts, and optimize resource utilization. This study is
   a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers,
   offering guidelines for collaborative efforts towards sustainable
   development. This paper paves the way for interdisciplinary cooperation
   and strategic alignment among diverse stakeholders, promoting innovative
   approaches to sustainable construction.},

Title = {Research on the Visualization of Railway Signal Operation and
   Maintenance Based on BIM plus GIS},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To adapt to the ``fine{''} and ``extensive{''} management
   characteristics of railway signal equipment operation and maintenance,
   achieving real-time and interactive monitoring of signal equipment
   operation status, and developing an integrated approach to equipment
   operation and maintenance, this paper takes a comprehensive management
   perspective. To create a lightweight BIM model, the Garland folding
   algorithm is utilized to simplify the IFC file format. Building on this
   approach, the data are divided based on building component division
   standards to obtain separate files containing geometric information and
   semantic attributes. The geometric information files are converted to a
   3D Tiles format, combining BIM semantic attributes with semantic
   attribute files through an intermediate format. Dynamic data management
   is achieved by setting the octree space index structure in combination
   with a view-frustum culling algorithm. Then, the 3D Tiles target file is
   imported into the Cesium platform, and Node.js is used to achieve
   three-dimensional visualization of railway signal operation and
   maintenance. The proposed method is verified using an inbound signal as
   an example to assess its feasibility. The results demonstrate the
   potential of the proposed method to achieve stable integration between
   BIM equipment full lifecycle maintenance and GIS geographical space
   display. Railway signal equipment is endowed with comprehensive
   one-click information query functions for equipment positioning and
   spatial analysis, improving the efficiency and scientific
   decision-making level of equipment operation and maintenance.},

Title = {The use of a BIM-based framework to support safe facility management
   processes},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {12-24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Maintenance personnel in the field of facility management (FM) are at
   constant risk of electrical shock, falls, crushing, cuts and bruises,
   and as a result, have a much higher rate of injury and illness than the
   national average. Case study analysis confirms that many recorded
   accidents could have been avoided had the victim followed appropriate
   hazard mitigation steps to safely execute a FM task. Currently, safety
   information is conveyed through training seminars, documents, and
   meetings. This information, although comprehensive, often remains
   fragmented among multiple resources. Research has shown that the more
   time and effort an individual must spend obtaining information, the less
   likely they are to retrieve the information and obey the stated
   warnings, directly relating to injuries and fatalities. This research
   attempts to mitigate these issues by describing current market trends,
   available technologies, and limitations. The paper presents a BIM-based
   framework to support safe maintenance and repair practices during the
   facility management phase, through safety attribute
   identification/classification, data processing and rule-based decision
   making, and a user interface. By developing a BIM-based framework for FM
   safety, an under utilized/under-researched usage of BIM is being
   explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study addresses the critical imperative of quantifying
   building information modeling (bimalliance) benefits by augmenting
   existing methodologies, with a focus on monetization. Engaging industry
   practitioners, the research develops a comprehensive framework through
   an exhaustive literature review and a survey in the Swedish construction
   industry, incorporating insights from 128
   respondents.Design/methodology/approachThe framework, validated by
   industry experts, systematically assesses tangible BIM benefits against
   associated costs. It introduces a novel method in construction,
   addressing the lack of a unified approach. The resulting framework
   facilitates nuanced feasibility determinations by systematically
   evaluating BIM benefits against costs.FindingsDespite its acknowledged
   limitations, the framework effectively captures a comprehensive range of
   costs and benefits, providing a more accurate and detailed estimation of
   BIM's impact on project outcomes.Practical implicationsWith practical
   implications, the framework enhances BIM understanding and application,
   contributing to effective project management throughout the construction
   supply chain lifecycle. Moreover, it aims to improve efficacy within the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations
   industry.Originality/valueThe study empowers organizations and
   decision-makers with a bespoke tool for evaluating BIM feasibility,

Title = {Towards a Conceptual Framework of Using Technology to Support Smart
   Construction: The Case of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC)},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Construction is a major source of carbon emissions. Moreover, it faces
   various other sustainability challenges, such as construction waste,
   construction noise, vehicular traffic near construction sites, dust and
   other air and water pollutants, and safety and well-being of
   construction workers. Poorly designed and constructed buildings will
   continue to affect the well-being of their occupants and overall energy
   efficiency throughout the building lifecycle. Hence, accelerating the
   transformation of the construction industry towards smart construction
   or Construction 4.0 is an important topic. The ways that technology can
   help to achieve smart construction, especially with the adoption of
   construction methods with increasing construction modularity, should be
   further explored. Focusing on modular integrated construction (MiC),
   this paper examines the following questions: (1) How has technology been
   applied to support MiC development and smart construction in Hong Kong?
   (2) What are the lessons learned? A case study approach of a building
   information model (BIM)-enabled multifunctional blockchain-based digital
   platform is adopted to allow us to systematically consider (1) the main
   objectives and scope, (2) the stakeholders involved, (3) the key
   outcomes and processes, (4) the applications of blockchain technology,
   and (5) the integration with other digital software and management
   platforms in practice. Drawing upon the experience, we propose a generic
   four-stage approach in understanding and facilitating the adoption of
   relevant technology towards smart construction. At Stage One, the
   technologies of BIM, RFID, and blockchain are applied to support the
   core elements of MiC production: just-in-time transportation and on-site
   installation. At Stage Two, the digital platform is extended to serve as
   an interface for third parties, notably government; monitoring,
   authentication, and certifications for information sharing;
   visualization; and real-time monitoring and updating of MiC projects. At
   Stage Three, the system focuses on people in the construction process,
   aiming to enhance the safety and well-being of workers and drivers
   throughout the construction process. Different Internet-of-Thing devices
   and sensors, construction robotics, closed-circuit television,
   dashboards, and cloud-based monitoring are deployed. At Stage Four, the
   full construction lifecycle is the focus, whereby a centralized smart
   command theatre is set up with multiple sources of data in a city
   information model.},

Abstract = {Construction 4.0 is witnessing exponential growth in digital twin (DT)
   technology developments and applications, revolutionizing the adoption
   of building information modelling (BIM) and other emerging technologies
   used throughout the built environment lifecycle. BIM provides
   technologies, procedures, and data schemas representing building
   components and systems. At the same time, the DT enhances this with
   real-time data for integrating cyber-physical systems, enabling live
   asset monitoring and better decision making. Despite being in the early
   stages of development, DT applications have rapidly progressed in the
   AEC sector, resulting in a diverse literature landscape due to the
   various technologies and parameters involved in fully developing the DT
   technology. The intricate complexities inherent in digital twin
   advancements have confused professionals and researchers. This confusion
   arises from the nuanced distinctions between the two technologies, i.e.,
   BIM and DT, causing a convergence that hinders realizing their
   potential. To address this confusion and lead to a swift development of
   DT technology, this study provides a holistic review of the existing
   research focusing on the critical components responsible for developing
   the applications of DT technology in the construction industry. It
   highlights five crucial elements: technologies, maturity levels, data
   layers, enablers, and functionalities. Additionally, it identifies
   research gaps and proposes future avenues for streamlined DT
   developments and applications in the AEC sector. Future researchers and
   practitioners can target data integrity, integration and transmission,
   bi-directional interoperability, non-technical factors, and data
   security to achieve mature digital twin applications for AEC practices.
   This study highlights the growing significance of DTs in construction
   and provides a foundation for further advancements in this field to
   harness its potential to transform built environment practices. It also
   pinpoints the latest developments in AI, namely the large language model
   (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)'s implications for DT
   education, policies, and the construction industry's practices.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Owner-operated (AECO)
   industry faces an array of productivity challenges, in part stemming
   from limited interoperability and suboptimal management of building
   information across project lifecycles. This paper investigates the
   application of rule-based systems from the manufacturing industry,
   especially as used in the semiconductor manufacturing sector, to improve
   productivity in the AECO industry. A comparative methodology is
   employed, examining processes in both the manufacturing and AECO
   industries. The results indicate that methodologies from semiconductor
   mask manufacturing can be effectively adapted for use in the AECO
   industry, particularly in design for buildability and standardized rule
   application. This paper includes the implementation of a
   Proof-of-Concept (POC) for Manufacturing Rule Check (MRC) in the AECO
   industry, focusing on Prefabricated Bathroom Units (PBU) production. The
   MRC developed for the POC could be integrated into the Model Checker
   platform of Singapore's CORENET X regulatory approval system, as well as
   deployed as a specialized application in the cloud that facilitates ease
   of collaboration among the design to fabrication players in the

Abstract = {In the context of system architecture design, design changes are deemed
   as an important issue in the field of cyber-physical systems. This is
   due to their costs that can increase up to several folds with each step
   of the life cycle, from conceptual design to operation. Accordingly,
   before putting such changes into practice, their impacts need to be
   analyzed based on traceability of dependencies among elements in system
   artifacts. However, traceability-based Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is
   time consuming and error-prone process, if performed manually. Thus, a
   number of tools have been developed in this regard. Yet, in the absence
   of approaches guiding the specification and implementation of such
   tools, research reveals their inadequacy for the needs of the industry.
   To overcome this, this paper proposes a domain-specific modeling
   approach for the conceptualization of traceability-based CIA tools. Such
   approach is composed of three building blocks. First, a language for
   traceability-based CIA designed around the concept of ``CIA
   parameters{''} (i.e., all kind of information that could contribute to
   quantitative or qualitative change impact assessment). Second, a
   modeling procedure referring to a multi-view modeling approach that
   explains how to use the traceability language to allow creation and
   machine processing of models (i.e., analysis of models in terms of
   change impact). Third, mechanisms and algorithms focusing on the
   implementation of the modeling procedure on a metamodeling platform. The
   proposed approach is thus an attempt to bridge the gap between design
   and implementation of traceability-based CIA tools. The approach is
   illustrated on an example from the aviation field.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest achievements of the past half century has been making
   ever tinier structures. This miniaturization is at the foundation of
   three pillars that comprise the Digital Age: (1) computation, (2)
   digitization, and (3) communication. First, it is discussed how
   developments along these three pillars have affected the field of
   engineered systems. Next, the impact of these developments on the life
   cycle of engineered systems is examined from the perspective of (1)
   Information Technology (IT), (2) Embedded Technology (ET), and (3)
   Operation Technology (OT). A key value driver of IT is in the improved
   design approaches that are enabled by (1) the abundance of compute power
   and (2) connecting design activity within an organization as well as
   across organizations. Similarly, ET has provided much value by enabling
   the use of computation as the most important feature value driver of
   modern products. In turn, the large number of these software features
   relies on advances in communication networks as a critical
   infrastructure. Furthermore, digitization with remote sensing has opened
   up a trove of new features such as those in the area of autonomy.
   Finally, OT has benefited much from computation and digitization with
   communication features enabling current developments such as
   over-the-air updates. Building on the examination, a ``design alive{''}
   outlook is presented that brings together the stages of system design
   and operation by live connectivity to continuously adapt each system on
   an individual basis and keep them performing in an optimal sense.},

Title = {Research on Carbon Emission Structure and Model in Low-Carbon Rural
   Areas: Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As the energy crisis and environmental problems are exacerbated, rural
   carbon emissions have gradually attracted increasing attention.
   Meanwhile, rural areas have the important function of ecological carbon
   sequestration, so the research field of carbon emissions has gradually
   expanded from urban to rural areas in recent years. To systematically
   sort out the research progress regarding low-carbon rural areas, a total
   of 583 papers published during 2013-2023 were acquired through the
   bibliometric analysis method from the ``professional field of science of
   building technology{''} in the core database of Web of Science. Then,
   the research stage, author cooperation, institutional cooperation,
   national distribution, and keyword co-occurrence of ``low-carbon rural
   areas{''} were analyzed via data visualization analysis software
   VOSviewer, and the current hot issues, such as carbon emission
   calculation list and elements, carbon emission measurement method/model,
   and energy saving and emission reduction paths, were further summarized
   and reviewed. The statistical analysis results show that: (1) in most of
   the current research on rural carbon emissions, geographical
   characteristics and rural carbon emissions have been rarely analyzed;
   (2) there is a lack of interdisciplinary research, e.g., less
   cooperation with geographic information or other disciplines; (3) the
   differences and characteristics of rural carbon emission factors in
   different economies and regions have rarely been analyzed. Based on the
   analysis, this research pointed out that future research can be
   comprehensively carried out in formulating rural carbon emission
   inventory, establishing a multi-scale and multi-regional statistical
   method and so on. This research also provides a comprehensive analysis
   and summary of the existing research on the structure and model of
   carbon emissions in low-carbon rural areas and also presents the
   problems that need to be paid attention to in the future research,
   pointing out the research direction for relevant scholars.},

Abstract = {The ravages of time, natural and man-made disasters, pollution, fatigue,
   overexposure, mismanagement, and the unintended consequences of efforts
   to preserve our cultural patrimony, have all taken a major toll on
   historical structures. Structural health assessment is the first pivotal
   step towards creating a strategy for long-term life-cycle management.
   Historical structures provide an abundance of unique challenges that
   when combined serve as a great qualifying test for the study of as-built
   structures. This paper explores the diagnostic value of terrestrial
   laser scanning for the structural health assessment of the Baptistery di
   San Giovanni in Florence, Italy and proposes an integrative methodology
   for repeatable data acquisition, processing, visualization and analysis.
   The presented study proves that even under challenging circumstances,
   efficient documentation of entire structures is possible. The case study
   at the Baptistery demonstrates that even when objectives are not formed
   prior to the survey, comprehensive data sets of high quality and
   reliability will enable meaningful structural health assessments. With a
   reliable comprehensive baseline model in place, it can be annotated,
   qualitatively analyzed and recurring surveys can be conducted to track
   changes and damages throughout time.},

   Construction Projects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The construction industry is considered one of the largest contributors
   to climate change through its consumption of natural resources and
   generation of greenhouse gases. Much of this can be attributed to
   inadequate decision making and follow-up within construction companies.
   To mitigate this problem, considerable research on Sustainable
   Development (SD) reports on decision support systems have been developed
   in order to make sound decisions with respect to the environment.
   Nonetheless, and despite the availability of such tools, these systems
   fail to track the commitment to SD decisions and goals during the
   different phases of construction projects in general and the design
   phase in particular. As such, this study identified three standard SD
   indicators: waste reduction, energy consumption, and carbon emissions as
   the main contributors, and developed the framework to track the project
   stakeholders' commitment to the relevant SD indicators during the
   project design phase. The developed framework was validated via an
   expert panel and used to create a Sustainable Development Commitment
   Tracking Tool (SDCTT-D). The SDCTT-D tool was also applied in an
   infrastructure project case study. The results of this study gauged the
   usability of the developed tool and corroborated the research premise.},

Title = {Genome-wide association study of salt tolerance at the germination stage
   in hemp},
Journal = {EUPHYTICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {219},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Seed germination is the first stage of the plant life cycle, and
   salinity is a major environmental stress for the inhibition of seed
   germination in plants. Hemp (Cannabis sativa. L) has high economic value
   and is widely used in textiles, building materials, food, health care,
   and so on. Unfortunately, research on the salt tolerance of hemp is very
   limited. In this study, 202 hemp accessions from 11 countries were used
   to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on salt tolerance at
   the germination stage. Based on 762,634 high-quality SNPs, 70 SNP loci
   were identified to be associated with salt tolerance-related traits
   (RGR-T1, RGR-T2, RSRL-T1, RSRL-T2, RSW-T1 and RSW-T2). Among the 70
   SNPs, nine were further analyzed as candidate SNPs, and 55 genes were
   annotated within 100 kb upstream and downstream of the nine SNPs.
   Combined with RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR results, XM\_030641043.1,
   XM\_030641906.1, XM\_030648362.1, XM\_030648308.1 and XM\_030646898.1
   may play a key role in regulating salt tolerance of hemp during
   germination. To our knowledge, this is the first study of hemp GWAS, and
   the information obtained in this study will be useful for gene cloning
   and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of salt tolerance in hemp.},

Title = {Role-based access to facilities lifecycle information on RFID tags},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {559-568},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems have been used in
   different applications in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction,
   Owner and Operator (AECOO) industry. Applications are mainly designed
   for specific lifecycle stage of the facility and serve the needs of only
   one of the stakeholders. This would increase the cost and the labor for
   adding and removing tags and eliminate the chance of using shared
   resources. In this paper, the usage of tags permanently attached to
   components is proposed where the memory of the tags is used during the
   lifecycle by different stakeholders for data storage and handover. A
   Building Information Model (BIM) database is used for tackling the
   interoperability issues allowing different users to access and share the
   data. To securely and efficiently store data on RFID tags in ifcXML
   format, multi-level encryption together with role-based access control
   is applied on the data stored on RFID tags. Each user is assigned a
   certain role and can only access the part of data for which he has
   authorization according to a predefined role and the Access Control
   Policy. To explore the technical feasibility of the proposed approach, a
   case study considering both facilities management and emergency
   management has been implemented and tested at Concordia University. (C)

Title = {Flow and stock accumulation of plastics in China: Patterns and drivers},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {852},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Plastic pollution has always been a hot issue of global concern.
   Previous studies have mainly focused on the flow of plas-tics. However,
   information on the patterns and characteristics of flow, stock, and
   waste in the plastic life cycle and their driving factors is limited in
   China, and effective waste reduction and sustainable strategies are
   missing. Therefore, this research established a flow model of
   polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET); fur-ther analyzed the driving factors; and proposed strategies
   for waste reduction and sustainable development. We found that the total
   consumption, stock, and waste of PET, PE, and PP in 2010-2017 reached
   552.96, 292.70, and 257.18 Tg, respectively. Building and construction
   (B\&C), packaging, and textiles were the sectors with the largest stock
   of PE, PP, and PET. From 2010 to 2013, the stock of PE increased by 440
   \%, which was mainly driven by the increase in material utilization
   intensity (MUI). Similarly, the growth of MUI was the main driving
   factor driving PP (351 \%) and PET (367 \%) stocks. Notably, from 2014
   to 2017, economic growth was the main factor driving the plastic stock.
   These results will provide a scientific basis for promoting the
   sustainable utilization of PE, PP, and PET and be of great signif-icance
   to achieve the strategic goal of a no-waste city.},

Title = {Modelling for economic cost and environmental analysis of rainwater
   harvesting systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {613-626},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {As a result of the integration of different methodological tools (life
   cycle assessment and dynamics simulation) and studies to evaluate the
   economic cost and the potential environmental impact of alternative
   water supplies (rainwater and greywater) for urban use, the software
   program Plugrisost (pluvials, greys and sustainability) has been
   developed. This modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water
   planning for smart city development. Plugrisost is a simulation model
   that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) and
   greywater systems at different scales of urban planning, It is the only
   tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing
   of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental
   analysis. Plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because
   it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater
   tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other
   tools. Plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of
   low environmental impact, such as infrastructure that incorporates the
   use of rainwater, and the self-sufficiency analysis of water in cities.
   Using Plugrisost, we have found that on the singlehouse scale, the
   economic viability of an RWH system would be possible if the price of
   water is greater than 4 Euros/m(3); and the environmental analysis would
   be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m(3) of storage capacity. On the
   apartment-building scale, the results are 1.4 Euros/m(3) and 33 m(3),
   respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   typically not available, nor are there wellestablished processes for
   generating such information. This review aims to understand how to
   address this broad knowledge gap to help scale up material reuse in the
   built environment. A flexible pattern-matching methodology is used to
   illuminate the research-industry gap by synthesizing insights from
   state-of-the-art literature on material reuse strategies as well as
   empirical data from various real-world cases. Results indicate that the
   organization of construction material information for reuse can be
   categorized into three main categories: information property attributes,
   information source, and reuse actions. This research contributes to the
   existing body of literature on building material reuse by a)
   synthesizing the current state-of-the-art in building material reuse
   research, b) identifying gaps and recurring themes across research and
   industrial practices, and c) contrasting theoretical approaches with
   real-world applications, highlighting areas of convergence and
   divergence. This study provides a taxonomy that can be useful for
   industry practitioners and academics, offering actionable insights to
   accelerate the transition to a more circular construction paradigm.},

Title = {How transport shapes copepod distributions in relation to whale feeding
   habitat: Demonstration of a new modelling framework},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Two copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and Colossus hyperboreus,
   constitute the main prey of endangered North Atlantic right whales in
   eastern Canadian shelf waters. Estimating the spatial distribution of
   Calanus spp. and understanding how it changes in response to
   environmental variability are crucial information requirements for
   mitigating risks to the right whale population. Here we present a new
   coupled dynamic model that builds on observations from the Atlantic Zone
   Monitoring Program (AZMP) and statistical modelling of copepod spatial
   distributions using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The coupled
   model is initialized with the GAMs climatological abundance and
   explicitly represents transport of the two species C. finmarchicus and
   C. hyperboreus via particle tracking, considering Calanus vertical
   swimming behavior and along-track mortality and temperature-dependent
   development. Assessment of model performance and the role of advection
   in determining the modelled Calanus distributions is focused on the
   southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL), an area regularly visited by right
   whales, and where local Calanus abundance is likely dependent on the
   seasonal transport from deep upstream areas. The coupled model simulates
   high Colossus abundance in the sGSL in summer and fall, distinct from
   the spatial distribution estimated by GAMs, which do not consider the
   effect of transport in the region. The exercise of building and testing
   this model allows us to investigate the factors producing high
   concentrations of late stage Colossus, and in the cases of model-data
   mismatch, infer important processes that are not adequately represented
   in the model. The model constitutes an important step forward in the
   ongoing effort to improve estimates of Colossus availability in the
   region, guiding future modelling efforts (e.g., a population development
   model) and potentially informing North Atlantic right whale management.},

Abstract = {With the increasing pressure to achieve breakthrough performance
   improvement, the need to implement highly effective, efficient and
   integrated management systems is continuously increasing. The paper
   introduces Systemic Performance and Cost Management (SPCM) as a business
   system framework to foster systems thinking, communication, aligned
   measurement, management and planning and the deployment of methods
   company-wide. As a business system framework, SPCM captures vision
   (focus), strategy, customer relationship and product life cycles,
   business processes, information and resources, and the organizational
   deployment of the above. Additionally, the paper shows how SPCM can
   support the Six Sigma Breakthrough Strategy.
   SPCM is based on several existing and practically proven management
   models and approaches specifically the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) to
   formulate a company strategy - that are aligned and integrated into a
   holistic framework to support breakthrough improvement. The paper
   explains the objectives and high-level architecture of SPCM, the goals
   and elements of each level it is composed of and how these levels
   interrelate with the Six Sigma Breakthrough Strategy. The paper provides
   an overview of how SPCM enables and fosters systems thinking
   company-wide by building a paradigm of the business for all persons
   involved at the business, operational and process level of the
   Breakthrough Strategy. In addition, the paper provides an overview of
   how SPCM can serve as a conceptual framework to integrate performance
   and cost management systems at the various levels of a business.},

Title = {Towards Sustainable Development through the Perspective of Construction
   4.0: Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The construction industry utilizes a substantial number of resources,
   which has negative impacts on both environmental and socioeconomic
   aspects. Therefore, it is important to reduce these negative impacts and
   maintain sustainable development (SD). Recent studies suggest that
   integrating Industry 4.0 (also called Construction 4.0 (C4.0) in the
   construction industry) and SD may help address these concerns, which is
   a new and ever-evolving field. In order to fully understand SD in the
   C4.0 context, this paper offers a verifiable and reproducible systematic
   literature review and bibliometric analysis of associated topics.
   Through a review of 229 works, this article presents the publication
   trend, the most prolific journals, countries, institutions, researchers,
   and keywords analysis, as well as the content analysis of C4.0 impacts
   on SD based on triple-bottom-line (TBL) dimensions. The authors also
   identify and summarize the critical success factors (CSFs) of C4.0
   toward SD. Overall, findings reveal the potential benefits of C4.0 on SD
   and contribute to the evaluation of sustainable C4.0 innovations. The
   key topics and CSFs identified in this work could potentially serve as
   the basis for future investigations, encouraging and directing
   interested researchers, and thus supporting both theoretical and
   practical progress in this evolving research area.},

Title = {Platforms for Smart Environments and Future Internet Design: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {165748-165778},
Abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is pushing the integration of physical and
   virtual worlds. Sensor devices provide rich sensory information to
   context-aware services. Actuators implement in the physical world
   application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more
   resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is
   an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the
   humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for
   building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a
   review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this
   big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling,
   digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy,
   communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other
   aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on
   future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons.
   The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current
   initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future
   Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity
   come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important
   aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe
   model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the
   limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the
   relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet
   research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved;
   (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and
   SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many
   others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are
   missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future
   Internet-based.},

Title = {Metamorphosis in the Cirripede Crustacean <i>Balanus amphitrite</i>},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Stalked and acorn barnacles (Cirripedia Thoracica) have a complex life
   cycle that includes a free-swimming nauplius larva, a cypris larva and a
   permanently attached sessile juvenile and adult barnacle. The barnacle
   cyprid is among the most highly specialized of marine invertebrate
   larvae and its settlement biology has been intensively studied. By
   contrast, surprisingly few papers have dealt with the critical series of
   metamorphic events from cementation of the cyprid to the substratum
   until the appearance of a suspension feeding juvenile. This
   metamorphosis is both ontogenetically complex and critical to the
   survival of the barnacle. Here we use video microscopy to present a
   timeline and description of morphological events from settled cyprid to
   juvenile barnacle in the model species Balanus amphitrite, representing
   an important step towards both a broader understanding of the settlement
   ecology of this species and a platform for studying the factors that
   control its metamorphosis. Metamorphosis in B. amphitrite involves a
   complex sequence of events: cementation, epidermis separation from the
   cypris cuticle, degeneration of cypris musculature, rotation of the
   thorax inside the mantle cavity, building of the juvenile musculature,
   contraction of antennular muscles, raising of the body, shedding of the
   cypris cuticle, shell plate and basis formation and, possibly, a further
   moult to become a suspension feeding barnacle. We compare these events
   with developmental information from other barnacle species and discuss
   them in the framework of barnacle settlement ecology.},

Abstract = {Bridge information modelling (BrIM) invokes stakeholder collaboration,
   supported by policy and process frameworks, combined with interoperable
   technology, to manage information and enable effective decision making
   throughout the lifecycle of a bridge asset. This paper considers the
   application of BrIM for the proposed rehabilitation of a heritage listed
   viaduct. The structure under consideration is the landmark Chetwynd
   viaduct in Cork (Ireland), which formed part of the Cork-Bandon railway
   infrastructure constructed in 1851 and decommissioned in 1961. As with
   infrastructure of its type, few as-built records exist. Consequently,
   the geometry, material properties and condition of the existing
   structure are required to inform the initial feasibility assessment and
   subsequent design, construction and operation of this viaduct asset.
   Respective BrIM and traditional approaches to the data capture phase are
   outlined and compared in terms of time, expertise and deliverables. The
   significant deliverables from the traditional approach include a
   three-dimensional (3D) solid model and independent 2D drawings.
   Significant deliverables achieved using a BrIM approach include an
   intelligent parametric 3D model and associated 2D drawings, as well as
   integrated datasets representative of the `as-is' structure. Based on
   reported research, the initial effort and time expended on model
   creation in particular will enable significant future benefits.},

Abstract = {The second edition of the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS)
   Guidelines for Siting and Layout of Facilities (2017) has been written
   to address the many developments in the last decade which have improved
   how companies survey and select new sites, evaluate acquisitions, or
   expand their existing facilities. By updating the title of the first
   edition issued in 2003, Guidelines for Facility Siting and Layout, it
   has been emphasized that this book focuses not only on siting of
   buildings and unit operations within a facility, but also on siting of
   facilities within a community. This guideline addresses issues for those
   involved in business and project development of processes with hazardous
   materials and energies, provides guidance for facility layout experts,
   and provides information for authorities and the public involved in the
   project's approval. In addition, this edition adds discussions on how
   the life cycle and long-term risks of the facility are addressed, how
   toxic dispersions and the effects of explosions are modeled, how changes
   can be more effectively managed, and how to select the optimal distances
   between the equipment. This article will provide an overview of the
   changes to the first edition, as well as provide an overview of the
   significant reviews and updates to the appendices containing the
   recommended separation distances and checklists that will help the teams
   obtain the information they need when locating the project, when
   arranging the processes, and when arranging the equipment. (C) 2017

Title = {Lean Based Maturity Framework Integrating Value, BIM and Big Data
   Analytics: Evidence from AEC Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The construction industry is considered as one of the least productive,
   highest energy consuming, and least digitized industries. The Lean
   Management (LM) philosophy became a significant way for eliminating
   non-value-added activities and wastes during a building's lifecycle.
   However, studies have shown that philosophies are not efficient by
   themselves to solve the issues of the construction industry. They need
   to be supported with the appropriate technologies and tools. Therefore,
   the integrated use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with LM or
   Value Engineering (VE) were proposed in the literature. Nonetheless, it
   was also seen that BIM can provide more insights and improvements when
   BIM is integrated with data analysis tools to analyze BIM data. In the
   literature, the synergies between these concepts are generally addressed
   pairwise, and there is no comprehensive framework which identifies their
   relationships. Therefore, this study aims to develop a maturity
   framework that facilitates the adoption of LM, VE, BIM, and Big Data
   Analytic (BDA) concepts to address long-standing productivity and
   digitalization issues in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction
   (AEC) industry. Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and its
   three-cycle view (relevance, rigor, and design cycle) were applied to
   build the proposed maturity framework. Two interviews were performed to
   identify and observe research problem in relevance cycle. In the rigor
   cycle, a comprehensive literature review was performed to create a base
   for the development of the maturity framework. In addition to the
   developed base of the framework, lean processes were added to this
   cycle. In the design cycle, the developed framework was evaluated and
   validated by five experts through face-to-face interviews. The
   importance of employer's requirements to adopt the proposed
   methodologies, the negative impact of change orders, the importance of
   pre-construction phases to facilitate value creation and waste
   elimination, and the usage of common data environment with BIM were
   identified as the prominent application and adaptation issues.},

Abstract = {Purpose Advancements in digital technologies have provided significant
   opportunities to improve the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
   Owner-operated (AECO) sector's performance through superior data
   management, streamlined processes and cooperative working practices.
   However, whilst academic literature widely espouses these benefits
   during the design and construction phases of development, research
   suggests that the operational phase of a building's lifecycle has yet to
   fully realise performance improvements available through the application
   of digital modelling technology. The purpose of this paper is to
   synthesise extant digital modelling, asset management and emergent
   digital asset management literature, to report upon the beneficial
   implications of digitalised asset management and identify obstacles
   hampering its adoption in industry.
   Design/methodology/approach A componential synthesis of future work
   reported upon in extant literature is organised into thematic categories
   that indicate potential research avenues and a trajectory for digital
   asset management research and practice.
   Findings Themes identified include: imprecise Building Information
   Modelling definitions; isolated software development; data
   interoperability; intellectual property and virtual property rights; and
   skills and training requirements. Notably, increased environmental
   performance also arose as a theme requiring further research but
   received considerably less academic coverage than the other obstacles
   identified.
   Originality/value The work presents a comprehensive review of digital
   technologies utilised within the AECO sector and as such provides
   utility to researchers, policy makers and practitioners to enhance their
   knowledge capabilities.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) has caught tremendous attention from
   businesses. In the present study, the authors propose that if BCT is
   used to track a product's life cycle, that is, when it was manufactured,
   purchased, and used by the first and subsequent owners, the information
   asymmetry present in the pre-owned automobile market can be
   significantly reduced. The study uses a qualitative procedure to explore
   the challenges which buyers, sellers and intermediaries face while
   buying and selling pre-owned automobiles, specifically in emerging
   economies. Theoretical constructs of the resource-based view and the
   trust-based marketing theory are used to explore the extent to which BCT
   can influence customer purchase intention and the marketing performance
   of firms dealing in pre-owned automobile products in emerging economies.
   We collected data by conducting eight focus group discussions with
   generation Y and Z individuals who had experience of buying or selling
   pre-owned automobiles. We also conducted five personal interviews with
   managers of pre-owned automobile online/omnichannel retailers to
   understand the industry's point of view. Three themes emerged during the
   study: `current challenges in pre-owned automobile transactions,' scope
   of blockchain in preowned automobile transactions,' and `concerns
   regarding blockchain adoption in pre-owned automobile transactions.' We
   present our findings based on these three themes. Further, we propose a
   conceptual model and provide theoretical and managerial implications for
   the preowned automobile industry.},

Abstract = {4D modeling has been an applied research area for around two decades
   since the first seminal works in the nineties. In the last years, a
   number of case studies have been published both for demonstrating the
   various applications of 4D and for assessing technological propositions.
   However, in most papers only little place is given to the particular
   content of 4D models. In parallel, following the growing implementation
   of Building Information Modeling, 4D modeling process is usually
   recognized as a ``BIM use{''}. In BIM implementations and protocols, the
   Level Of Development of datasets is a fundamental issue. This paper
   describes the application of two distinct ``4D uses{''} conducted on a
   single pilot project. They aim to assess the levels of graphical and
   temporal details required for the implemented uses. The authors finally
   discuss the diversity of 4D uses with 4D models, both planned or ad-hoc,
   as well as the logical understanding related to 4D LOD. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {Seismic losses due to earthquakes have been shown to have significant
   economic, social and environmental consequences. Over recent years,
   research to predict potential economic and social impact due to seismic
   risk has been increasing. Recognizing that the traditional philosophy of
   life safety design can lead to extensive damage and demolition which has
   a large environmental cost, incorporating environmental impacts
   associated with the expected seismic damage over a building's life is a
   key step as the building industry moves towards both sustainable and
   seismically resilient design. This paper introduces a framework that
   uses environmental indicators quantifying losses from seismic response
   that can then be used to advocate for a change in seismic performance
   objectives. First, existing literature and previously developed
   approaches for quantifying potential environmental impact due to seismic
   damage are summarized. Next, performance based earthquake engineering
   concepts are used to demonstrate a probabilistic approach to quantify
   potential environmental impacts using a range of environmental and
   resource use indicators over the life span of a case study building. In
   addition, a case study is presented to compare different environmental
   indicators between a Code Minimum building and the same building
   redesigned for a higher seismic performance. The majority of the
   composition of the environmental indicator values are from the inclusion
   of the non-repairable scenario, and from the repair activities, the
   majority of the impacts are from damage to drift sensitive components
   including curtains walls, partitions and elevators. For the Code Minimum
   building the non-repairable scenario contributes to between 8 to 11\%
   the total seismic cost. For the Stronger Stiffer building, the
   non-repairable scenario contributes around 3\% of the initial impact.
   Neglecting non-repairable scenarios does significantly reduce the
   potential environmental impacts when analyzing buildings designed for
   current code minimum structural standards.},

Title = {I-BIM based approach for geotechnical and numerical modelling of a
   conventional tunnel excavation},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Very recently the Building Information Modeling (BIM) design approach
   has landed in the infrastructure field, giving life to the I-BIM, the
   BIM for the infrastructures, including geotechnical underground works
   likes tunnels. In this framework, the present paper shows an application
   in the field of geotechnical engineering of the BIM based design
   approach to the case of an underground line. It is a tunnel excavated by
   means of traditional method, currently under construction. The project
   defines, in a central BIM model, a detailed tunnel structure model
   integrated with geological-geotechnical information for the definition
   of the subsoil 3D model. Once the BIM model of the tunnel stretch under
   study was completely defined, it was imported into a finite element (FE)
   model to perform deformation analyses. Thus, BIM-to-FEM-to-BIM
   interoperability was exploited in order to verify the maturity level of
   the BIM approach in the field of application for geotechnical
   infrastructures. Finally, the BIM fourth dimension (4D) was also
   implemented in the central model for the time management of the tunnel
   excavation process, synchronized with the numerical model. The BIM based
   procedure proposed in the present work can be considered as a case study
   in the technical literature of I-BIM for tunnels, putting in evidence
   limitations and advantages: i) a high level of BIM maturity was not yet
   achieved in the infrastructures field; ii) the BIM-to-FEM
   interoperability seems to be not fully effective and many operations
   still require the manual intervention; iii) the FEM-to-BIM
   interoperability brings back all geotechnical choices and hypothesis to
   the central BIM model, linking the models into a continuously
   interoperable circuit; iv) an important part of the design of civil
   infrastructures consists of addressing geotechnical aspects, hence the
   inclusion of ground conditions and geotechnical data into the BIM model
   can improve the quality and the usefulness of the model, not only during
   the design phase but also, and in particular, during the construction
   and the lifecycle management of the infrastructure, as a support to
   decision making process especially in urban context.},

Abstract = {This writing presents research gaps in the area of Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) in Facility Management (FM) industry, and identifies
   practical challenges that facility management professionals are facing
   in utilizing BIM. Although this issue, BIM for Facility Management, has
   gained attention both in literature and practice, and it is highly
   demanded in FM industry, still it is far away from effective
   implementation. It is not clear for facility manager whether BIM is
   helpful to accelerate the process or it is a cost effective solution,
   and what skills are required for them. The key for effective BIM
   implementation in FM industry is to enhance collaboration among
   different parties in project lifecycle. However, still there is a doubt
   about the importance of FM in Construction industry. In other words,
   construction does not understand FM. Furthermore, there are issues over
   interoperability and data exchange. Thus, to assist BIM implementation,
   it is required to prove the correctness of benefits, uses, and
   challenges identified in the literature. This paper uses an intensive
   literature review and highlights the potential research issues in terms
   of BIM for FM to assist effective implementation of BIM in facility

Volume = {15},

Pages = {136-152},
Abstract = {The construction industry is a highly labor-intensive industry with a
   low degree of automation and digitization. However, as in the
   manufacturing industry, a `new order' is emerging for the way the
   construction industry works today. This study aims to present the
   transformation of construction supply chains (CSCs) in Industry 4.0 by
   considering each supply chain stage separately, where the main purpose
   is to determine the criteria for the integration of the CSC with the
   Industry 4.0 perspective. A literature review and a Delphi study were
   conducted, and thirteen criteria are proposed to show the integration of
   Industry 4.0 aspects and CSC stages. Furthermore, one of the multi
   -criteria decision -making (MCDM) methods, the Best -Worst method, is
   used to prioritize the criteria for guiding future implications during
   the transformation of construction supply chains. Among the six CSC
   stages, the design stage is the most important from the Industry 4.0
   perspective. In addition, client collaboration by ICT (BIM) during the
   design phase is the most important sub -factors' overall rank. Although
   there is a limited number of studies on the CSC, there are no empirical
   studies addressing the current digital age approach. As a result, there
   is a significant gap in the construction literature, and a thorough
   assessment of the building supply chain in an Industry 4.0 setting is
   lacking. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study
   to illustrate the transformation of CSCs in Construction 4.0 by looking
   at each supply chain stage separately.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore existing literature on
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) in Malaysia and examine the
   perception of practitioners about the potential of BIM applications in
   reducing construction waste and enhancing productivity.
   Design/methodology/approach First, using 244 bibliographic data
   extracted from the Scopus database, the paper used scientometric
   analysis and VOSviewer mapping technique to assess the most impactful
   publication literature on BIM in Malaysia to identify the existing
   research gaps. Second, using a structured questionnaire, a total of 100
   questionnaires were distributed to practising practitioners who
   incorporate BIM in the delivery of their projects. Descriptive analysis
   using cross-tabulation in SPSS software, radar chart, relative
   importance index and Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the
   data. Findings The research gaps are in the fields of construction
   projects, buildings, energy efficiency, lifecycle and housing. The
   findings of the survey indicate that quantity take-off, clash detection,
   site utilization planning, digital fabrication as well as 4D stimulation
   were the main BIM applications used among the practitioners in Johor and
   Selangor. Practical implications By assessing the state-of-the-art of
   BIM and BIM applications in this region, the practical implications of
   this study provide useful insights to construction stakeholders, funding
   organizations, policymakers, research institutions, professionals,
   journal editors, reviewers and researchers to understand the overall
   trend of BIM in Malaysia and its usage. Originality/value This paper is
   the first to use science mapping using scientometrics to reveal the
   current BIM research in ``Malaysia only{''}. Relying on the identified
   gaps, the study further examined the usage of BIM applications in
   Malaysian construction projects.},

Abstract = {Energy prediction methods and tools play a crucial role in the lifecycle
   of energy-efficient buildings. Such tools and methods could be leveraged
   at different stages of a project by different actors including but not
   limited to: 1) owners and facility managers for evaluating cost of
   ownership, 2) architects and engineers for selecting the best-fit system
   for target energy performance, and 3) construction managers for making
   more informed value-engineering decisions. There are two major
   approaches for energy modeling: Forward Modeling and Inverse Modeling.
   The former approach is the most common approach used in industry due to
   its quick analysis process. In this approach, provides a prediction of
   energy use by building system design parameters and environmental
   drivers using energy models. On contrary, inverse modeling approach is
   used to select building parameters such as energy conservation measures
   from energy use and drivers by developing statistical models with the
   use of available data. However, the gap between predicted and actual is
   larger compared to the forward modeling approach due to the differences
   in detailing and interoperability issue between the design authoring and
   analysis tools. Even though some energy analysis tools include an
   authoring module, the modeling details are limited. There is a variety
   of design authoring and energy simulation tools that could communicate
   with each other using open file formats such as industry foundation
   classes (IFC). This paper investigated two different energy analysis
   workflows and selection of parameters to compare them with the metered
   data available for an educational facility building located in 5A
   climate region. These two workflows include: 1) creating a physical
   model in a BIM authoring tool and transferring the model to an energy
   analysis model by means of IFC file format, 2) creating an energy model
   directly in an energy analysis tool. In the light of this case study,
   this research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing 1)
   justification of testing criteria for the selection of simulation tool,
   workflow, and level of development (LOD) for models, 2) parameters for
   modeling, and 3) metered conditions for the basecase to compare with two
   different energy analysis building information modeling (BIM) workflow
   by using same design authoring and energy simulation tools.},

   or where the process changes, changing the distribution of data (i.e.
   concept drift). This is particularly challenging in highly
   reconfigurable and flexible environments. Having to develop machine
   learning models from scratch every single time is not cost-effective,
   time-consuming, requires expert knowledge that is typically not
   available in the manufacturing environment as well as can be challenging
   when data is not available in high volumes. Model robustness,
   reusability, adaptability and life cycle management are the keys to
   scale-up this technology in the manufacturing industry. In this work, a
   conceptual framework to enable simple and robust ML model development
   for the shop floor is introduced. Referred here as Frugal Industrial AI,
   the approach takes advantage of existing models and their context to
   build more robust ones in a data-efficient manner. Using a semantic
   knowledge base of how to construct these models for different
   manufacturing applications and semi-automating the development or reuse
   of solutions through semantic similarity, it is demonstrated how models
   can be developed in a more streamlined way. In addition, it is
   demonstrated how capturing process context information is important for
   the effective reuse of existing models through continual learning. This
   is key to building more robust ML solutions that can deal with real
   changing manufacturing environments, avoiding retraining from scratch as
   well as enabling the non-expert to use AI effectively on the shop floor.},

Title = {AndroShield: Automated Android Applications Vulnerability Detection, a
   Hybrid Static and Dynamic Analysis Approach},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The security of mobile applications has become a major research field
   which is associated with a lot of challenges. The high rate of
   developing mobile applications has resulted in less secure applications.
   This is due to what is called the ``rush to release{''} as defined by
   Ponemon Institute. Security testing-which is considered one of the main
   phases of the development life cycle-is either not performed or given
   minimal time; hence, there is a need for security testing automation.
   One of the techniques used is Automated Vulnerability Detection.
   Vulnerability detection is one of the security tests that aims at
   pinpointing potential security leaks. Fixing those leaks results in
   protecting smart-phones and tablet mobile device users against attacks.
   This paper focuses on building a hybrid approach of static and dynamic
   analysis for detecting the vulnerabilities of Android applications. This
   approach is capsuled in a usable platform (web application) to make it
   easy to use for both public users and professional developers. Static
   analysis, on one hand, performs code analysis. It does not require
   running the application to detect vulnerabilities. Dynamic analysis, on
   the other hand, detects the vulnerabilities that are dependent on the
   run-time behaviour of the application and cannot be detected using
   static analysis. The model is evaluated against different applications
   with different security vulnerabilities. Compared with other detection
   platforms, our model detects information leaks as well as insecure
   network requests alongside other commonly detected flaws that harm
   users' privacy. The code is available through a GitHub repository for
   public contribution.},

Abstract = {The scientific literature related to the adoption of the Building
   Information Modeling has incredibly grown up in recent years, although
   it is still lacking of formal and effective general workflows explicitly
   dedicated to the built domain. The meaning of the term HBIM itself,
   often misused to outline the digital process applied to existing
   constructions, is erroneously misconceived, as it is primarily a
   comparative methodology between digital surveys and their derivative 3D
   abstractions, not a generic acronym to be used when referring to the
   whole digitalization of the built environment. The aware acceptance of
   digital methodologies and procedures for existing buildings (not
   necessarily monuments or archaeological sites) as well as the BIM
   lifecycle approach adoption on new constructions, is a strategic
   decision that, however, needs to be properly evaluated when considering
   the optimal workflows to be preferred from time to time. Also, the
   intervention on consolidated buildings or facilities has to follow a
   path made of procedures and intertwined digital models, following
   patterns of increasing complexity. The two elements, process and models,
   are deeply intertwined even though the former is still not explicited
   for the latter, due to a standardization at an embryonic stage and,
   perhaps, seriously confused by someone with politics. From the software
   perspective, interoperable file formats and data structures considering
   information for restorations and renovations are in development all over
   the European countries. Thus, this paper delves into considerations,
   implications and effects of a possible mature and aware adoption of IT
   and digital technologies for restoration, renovation and documentation
   design intents. Introducing some reflections whose outcomes are
   represented by the application of novel dedicated strategies fitted on
   advanced equipment to better understand the existing realm (proximity
   TLS and UAVs surveys, use of sensors, etc.), the paper brings into the
   discussion some future scenarios on the uses of more and more
   interconnected semantic technologies, proposing a consolidated technique
   meant to survey, analyze and replicate existing buildings into semantic
   BIM models. Moreover, the data interpretation operated by machines could
   be the most promising scenario for the digital transition in the built
   environment: when most of the knowledge contents about buildings and
   monuments will be no longer intelligible only to the human perception,
   but they will be extended to the machine through a shared digital
   language, analysis, estimations, and different operational schemes will
   probably allow the choice of the right intervention through many
   alternatives, leading to an increased quality for restorations and
   renovations.},

Title = {FROM DATA TO 3D DIGITAL ARCHIVE: A GIS-BIM SPATIAL DATABASE FOR THE
   HISTORICAL CENTRE OF PAVIA (ITALY)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {459-471},
Abstract = {Historical city centres are called to be witnesses of the past while
   supporting modern life. The competing needs for conservation and
   transformation involved in their development introduce a complex and
   multidisciplinary problem, which can be handled only by using proper
   tools. In this framework, the definition of shared digital archives able
   to collect and organize heterogenous data is believed to be the first
   step for the creation of an effective knowledge base, capable of
   activating analyses and supporting decision-making processes. The study
   presented here starts from the discussion of the requirements that an
   information system on historical centres should meet, and proposes a
   workflow based on the interoperability between GIS (Geographic
   Information System) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) aimed at the
   realization of a spatial relational database founded on CityGML. The OGC
   (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard was chosen in view of its capacity
   of representing the objects with their geometrical, topological and
   semantic properties, by specifying their relationships in a hierarchical
   environment. With the idea of introducing a repeatable model, the whole
   process starts from easily retrievable data on the city and makes use of
   standard data models, classification systems, programming languages and,
   as much as possible, of open software and contents. In order to test and
   validate the process the case study of the historical centre of Pavia
   (Italy) is presented as an experiment at the urban scale, while a single
   historical building complex is modelled for the assessment of the
   compliance to higher Levels of Detail. The workflow used to manage and
   display the information employs Visual Programming Language (VPL) and
   follows a four stages process: the retrieval of the input data, the
   informative modelling (GIS or BIM), the conversion in CityGML and the
   inclusion in the relational database. As a result, a three-dimensional
   spatial relational database in a standard data model is defined, capable
   of harmonizing, storing and organizing building information on
   historical city centres.},

Abstract = {The Archimed data warehouse project started in 1993 at the Geneva
   University Hospital. It has progressively integrated seven data marts
   (or domains of activity)) archiving medical data such as
   Admission/Discharge/Transfer (ADT) data, laboratory results, radiology
   exams, diagnoses, and procedure codes. The objective of the Archimed
   data warehouse is to facilitate the access to an integrated and coherent
   view of patient medical in order to support analytical activities such
   as medical statistics, clinical studies, retrieval of similar cases and
   data mining processes. This paper discusses three principal design
   aspects relative to the conception of the database of the data
   warehouse: 1) the granularity of the database, which refers to the level
   of detail or summarization of data, 2) the database model and
   architecture, describing how data will be presented to end users and how
   new data is integrated, 3) the life cycle of the database, in order to
   ensure long term scalability of the environment. Both, the organization
   of patient medical data using a standardized elementary fact
   representation and the use of the multi dimensional model have proved to
   be powerful design tools to integrate data coming front the multiple
   heterogeneous database systems part of the transactional Hospital
   Information System (HIS). Concurrently, the building of the data
   warehouse in an incremental way has, helped to control the evolution of
   the data content. These three design aspects bring clarity and
   performance regarding data access. They also provide long term
   scalability to the system and resilience to further changes that may
   occur in source systems feeding the data warehouse.},

Abstract = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been experiencing the need for higher
   growth in gross domestic product (GDP) over the last few years. This
   growth necessitates the investments in major construction projects over
   the next few years. Unlike the projects in other industries,
   construction projects subjected to unique characteristics increase the
   probability of risks occurrence and their impact on achieving project
   objectives. Design stage was found to have a significant role in
   managing the risks during the project's lifecycle. However; key
   challenges arise from the facts that the design phase has a numerous of
   interdependent, knowledge intensive multidisciplinary tasks and the
   overall process is inherently iterative in nature. This poor design
   interface management leads to project time overrun, cost overrun and
   poor quality output. Many tools and methods have been developed for the
   design information management. However these methods are not widely used
   except the building information modeling (BIM). Construction industry
   has benefited in many areas through BIM, and a natural consequent is to
   investigate its capabilities in managing risks. Literature review
   revealed that the existing BIM-based risk management frameworks required
   further development to manage the design phase related risks impacting
   the time, cost and quality of DBB projects. This paper proposed a
   conceptual BIM-based risk management framework to manage the design
   phase related risks for DBB high rise building projects in UAE. A
   framework has been validated through a case study. The results show that
   the risks can be effectively mitigated by implementing the proposed
   framework.},

Abstract = {There are various types of ancillary building facilities of highway,
   including management facilities (management sub-center, toll station,
   maintenance, highway administration, overloading management, tunnel
   management, bridge management, and rescue station) and service
   facilities (parking area and service area), which are distributed on
   both sides of highways according to the line selection and function
   requirements of highway; however, because of the concept of
   ``ancillary{''} and scale, they are completely out of step with the
   development trend and requirements of the times. In spite of small scale
   and land area, ancillary building facilities of highway have their own
   system and consume more resources and energy than urban buildings from
   building construction, operation and maintenance, demolition, and
   disposal of building materials. If they aren't designed in a reasonable
   way, they will emit more carbon dioxide and damage the natural
   ecological environment along the highway. Since building is a product
   with a long lifecycle, the study on the carbon emission of buildings
   needs to explore the characteristics of each stage in the lifecycle of
   buildings, so as to find out the scheme having the least impact on
   environment and achieve low energy consumption, low emission, and even
   zero emission. According to the characteristics of building activities
   in the full lifecycles of different types of ancillary building
   facilities of highway, this paper studies how to build a BIM model from
   design and construction to operation and maintenance of buildings with
   BIM technology and then establish a full-lifecycle carbon emission model
   of buildings by using the theory of full-lifecycle assessment, in order
   to determine the zero-carbon design method for ancillary building
   facilities of highway.},

Abstract = {Elements that constitute the built environment are vast and so are the
   independent systems developed to model its various aspects. Many of
   these systems have been developed under various assumptions and
   approaches to execute functions that are distinct, complementary or
   sometimes similar. Furthermore, these systems are ever increasing in
   number and often assume similar nomenclatures and acronyms, thereby
   exacerbating the challenges of understanding their peculiar functions,
   definitions and differences. The current societal demand to improve
   sustainability performance through collaboration as well as whole-system
   and through-life thinking is driving the need to integrate independent
   systems associated with different aspects and scales of the built
   environment to deliver smart solutions and services that improve the
   well-being of citizens. The contemporary object-oriented digitization of
   real-world elements appears to provide a leeway for amalgamating the
   modelling systems of various domains in the built environment which we
   termed as built environment information modelling (BeIM). These domains
   include architecture, engineering, construction as well as urban
   planning and design. Applications such as building information
   modelling, geographic information systems and 3D city modelling systems
   are now being integrated for city modelling purposes. The various works
   directed at integrating these systems are examined, revealing that
   current research efforts on integration fall into three categories: (1)
   data/file conversion systems, (2) semantic mapping systems and (3) the
   hybrid of both. The review outcome suggests that good knowledge of these
   domains and how their respective systems operate is vital to pursuing
   holistic systems integration in the built environment.},

Abstract = {The traditional supply chains faces several challenges such as
   uncertainty, cost, complexity and vulnerable problems. To overcome these
   problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a
   large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information,
   products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies
   the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through
   building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website
   for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each
   stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag
   and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply
   chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the
   database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers
   and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager
   gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this
   will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing
   security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also
   proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial
   and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation
   Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect
   interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security
   requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the
   neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and
   sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and
   practitioners to design secure system of supply chains. We presented
   DEMATEL and AHP in neutrosophic environment to deal effectively with
   vague, uncertain and incomplete information. So the proposed system of
   supply chain management will be able to overcome all challenges of
   traditional SCM and provide secure environment of SCM processes. (C)

Abstract = {An IT Project Manager is responsible for project planning, estimating
   and scheduling, developing and monitoring the progress throughout its
   development life cycle. The selection of a particular methodology is
   heuristic and the performance of the system developed is unpredictable.
   The authors suggest that a designed process performance model (PPM) can
   help to predict the required factors of a process to help achieve set
   goals for the process. This, in turn, can help to control factors that
   the project and the organizations need to control and ensure expected
   results. PPMs may enable to work out the relationship between different
   variables for a well-defined project and this knowledge becomes basis
   for prediction of performance solution, and helps in implementation of
   solution. This approach related to designing of PPMs, for various real
   life projects situations has not been attempted by industry in a big
   way. The authors demonstrate how to work out the PPMs, based on the
   given inputs of projects, by an Indian IT company. The solution works
   out number of bids which arrive at a given time or predict when the next
   bid will arrive at service centre, based on time series and queuing
   theory approach. This solution approach is based on different problems
   that will become the basis to build PPMs for similar problems. The
   problems discussed here are from an Information Technology Company, with
   real life data from the projects under development. Testing these models
   with more projects data thus will formalize how to build PPMs in a
   similar way. The authors discuss problem areas where time series and
   queuing theory Models can be applied and benefits of the present
   approach. The authors have similarly worked on different mathematical
   models based on industry data and build PPMs based on Bayesian,
   regression, fuzzy logic and other models. This paper is submitted with
   only two models just to prove the concept. In future building PPMs is
   likely to be a necessity in high maturity IT organizations.},

Abstract = {Technology and innovations have fueled the evolution of Industry 4.0,
   the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 encourages growth and
   development through its efficiency capacity, as documented in the
   literature. The growth of the construction industry is a subset of the
   universal set of the gross domestic product value; thus, Industry 4.0
   has a spillover effect on the engineering and construction industry. In
   this study, we aimed to map the state of Industry 4.0 in the
   construction industry, to identify its key areas, and evaluate and
   interpret the available evidence. We focused our literature search on
   Web of Science and Scopus between January 2015 and May 2019. The search
   was dependent on the following keywords: Industry 4.0 OR Industrial
   revolution 4.0 AND TOPIC: construction OR building. From the 82 papers
   found, 20 full-length papers were included in this review. Results from
   the targeted papers were split into three clusters: technology,
   security, and management. With building information modelling (BIM) as
   the core in the cyber-physical system, the cyber-planning-physical
   system is able to accommodate BIM functionalities to improve
   construction lifecycle. This collaboration and autonomous
   synchronization system are able to automate the design and construction
   processes, and improve the ability of handling substantial amounts of
   heterogeneity-laden data. Industry 4.0 is expected to augment both the
   quality and productivity of construction and attract domestic and
   foreign investors.},

Title = {An investigation into BIM-based detailed cost estimating and drivers to
   the adoption of BIM in quantity surveying practices},

Abstract = {Purpose Although studies have shown the relevance of building
   information modeling (BIM) in cost estimating process, efforts at
   investigating BIM based detailed cost estimating among professional
   quantity surveyors through quantitative approach are scanty. The purpose
   of this study is to identify and examine the usage of BIM-based detailed
   cost estimating software and assesses the drivers to BIM adoption within
   the Nigerian quantity surveying consulting firms.
   Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review, pilot
   study and questionnaire survey were adopted. The survey targeted both
   the BIM users and non- BIM users' quantity surveying consulting firms in
   Lagos, Nigeria. The data collected were analyzed using frequency,
   percentage, mean score, standard deviation, Mann-Whitney test and factor
   analysis. Findings The study found that 46.58 per cent of quantity
   surveying consulting firms are aware of BIM and have adopted it for
   detailed cost estimating, while 49.32 per cent of quantity surveying
   consulting firms are aware but have not adopted BIM-based detailed cost
   estimating, and 4.10 per cent of quantity surveying consulting firms are
   not aware at all. Also, the study identified various BIM-based detailed
   cost estimating software used in quantity surveying practices and found
   that Microsoft Excel is often used alongside 3D software, Autodesk QTO,
   Navisworks, Innovaya Composer and CostX are prevalent BIM software used
   for detailed cost estimating. In addition, the study identified 21
   drivers to the adoption of BIM in quantity surveying practices. The
   result of factor analysis grouped the 21 identified drivers into five
   principal factors: improved whole lifecycle/design quality, enhanced
   decision and visualization, cost and time saving, marketing and support
   for quantity surveyor tasks and government and client pressure.
   Originality/value Accurate cost estimating, effective cost monitoring
   and control are essential elements to a construction project success.
   This study further emphasized the importance of BIM to quantity
   surveying practices, particularly in the area of the detailed cost
   estimating.},

Abstract = {Improving resource efficiency is critical to reduce the environmental
   impacts of constructing and maintaining the built environment. A growing
   body of research has been investigating where and for what purposes
   construction materials are consumed in cities. Much of this existing
   research relies on archetypes to simplify the analysis of the large
   number of structures, and city-scale bottom-up material stock
   assessments mostly examine buildings to the exclusion of other urban
   structures. In this research we examine the effectiveness of pavement
   archetypes compared to spatially disaggregate pavement material data
   from a municipal pavement management database for stock estimation and
   find that the use of archetypes can lead to asymmetric estimation errors
   (i.e., variability in prediction error among materials and across the
   city's geography). We use Toronto's road network as a case study and
   estimate the stocks of concrete, asphalt, and granular materials. The
   stock of materials is unevenly distributed, in terms of both material
   type (uneven distribution of concrete vs. asphalt) and when normalized
   by area and population. In general, the use of archetypes tends to
   obscure spatial variability in material use, even across a relatively
   limited geographical area like Toronto and relatively consistent product
   like roads. We argue that the uncertainty inherent in the use of
   archetypes is significant and should be accounted for in bottom-up urban
   material flow analysis, that governments are in a unique position to
   provide high quality data for study, and that efforts should be made to
   capture, collate, and share this information more widely.},

   ducts above ceilings, are normally hidden, indicating the necessity of
   applying certain technology that can enable users to visualize and
   update the information of hidden facilities. Real-time location
   information is also needed so that users can be aware of their current
   location and the surrounding facility can be displayed accordingly.
   Therefore, this paper aims to develop location aware augmented reality
   (AR) framework for FMM with building information modeling (BIM) as the
   data source, AR for the interaction between users and facilities, and
   Wi-Fi fingerprinting for providing real-time location information. The
   developed framework has the following features: (1) a proposed
   softmax-based weighted K nearest neighbour (S-WKNN) algorithm is used
   for Wi-Fi fingerprinting to obtain the current location of users; (2) a
   room identification method, based on BIM, the obtained location, and ray
   casting algorithm, is proposed to identify which room the user is
   currently in; (3) according to the obtained location and the identified
   room, users can visualize and interact with their surrounding facilities
   through the AR devices; and (4) users in a remote location can visualize
   site situation and interact with site facilities in real time through
   video streaming and the shared database. At the end of the paper, an
   experiment was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed
   system. As shown by the experiment, the developed AR collaborative
   system can reduce the completion time of the designed task by around
   65\% compared with traditional 2D drawing-based method, and can provide
   a localization accuracy of around 1m.},

Abstract = {The identification of job hazards, before they actually occur, is a
   challenge for the construction work planner as well as for the safety
   and health coordinator. The high-risk construction sector records the
   highest number of accidents among different industry sectors. In most
   cases, safety planning is purely based on checklists and manual
   description, which are not closely related to the actual and specific
   construction object. Modern technologies, such as Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), are offering an object-oriented planning approach toward
   a project's lifecycle. This paper presents a research-in-progress
   project, where the BIM technology has been used to identify
   object-oriented and process-oriented job safety hazards. Here, the
   necessary construction processes will be derived from the ``to
   build{''}-objects in the model. The proposed framework would be able to
   detect a safety hazard during the early phases of design and planning
   processes. The scope of research in this paper is limited to safety
   hazards in solid construction.},

Abstract = {The complexity of data and methods in industrial ecology (IE) keeps
   growing, and the demand for comprehensive and interdisciplinary
   assessments increases. To keep up with this development, the field needs
   a data infrastructure that allows researchers to annotate, store,
   retrieve, combine, and exchange data at low cost, without loss of
   information, and across disciplines and model frameworks. A
   consensus-building debate about how to describe the common object of
   study, socioeconomic metabolism (SEM), is necessary for the development
   of practical data structures and databases. We review the definitions of
   basic concepts to describe SEM in IE and related fields such as
   integrated assessment modeling. We find that many definitions are not
   compatible, are implicit, and are sometimes lacking. To resolve the
   conflicts and inconsistencies within the current definitions, we propose
   a hierarchical system of terms and definitions, a practical ontology,
   for describing objects, their properties, and events in SEM. We propose
   a typology of object properties and use sets to group objects into a
   hierarchical, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive (H-MECE)
   classification. This grouping leads to a general definition of stocks.
   We show that a MECE representation of events necessarily requires two
   complementary concepts: processes and flows, for which we propose
   general definitions based on sets. Using these definitions, we show that
   the system structure of any interdisciplinary model of SEM can be
   formulated as a directed graph. We propose guidelines for semantic data
   annotation and database design, which can help to turn the vision of a
   powerful data infrastructure for SEM research into reality.},

Title = {Digitalization of Multi-Object Technological Projecting in Terms of
   Small Batch Production},
Journal = {INVENTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Decreasing the share of time for the technological training of new
   product creation is an actual and perspective task. The actuality of the
   given task always increases with the development of machine-building
   production. Changes which happen inside the organization of industrial
   production are connected to the development of consumer demand. Modern
   tendencies are such that there can be seen a constant lowering of batch
   products with an increase in the range of their production, and,
   consequently, a reduction in the production stage of the product life
   cycle. Under these conditions, it is necessary to react as quickly as
   possible to changes of external (for example, the arrival of new
   production orders, adjusting the number of already started production,
   etc.) and internal conditions (for example, stopping technological
   equipment for organizational reasons, correcting production routes for
   parts, etc.). Obviously, the effectiveness of the functioning of the
   production system will be determined primarily by the right decisions.
   Errors lead to large material costs and a serious loss of time, which
   can be fatal for an enterprise. The development goal described in the
   article is to build a digital model of a production system that
   allows-on a machine time scale and in the absence of material costs-the
   analysis of various control scenarios and finding correct solutions in
   in short time. The methodological basis for constructing such models is
   the use of simulation modeling with the combination of discrete event
   and agent modeling. The construction of a model on this principle allows
   its openness to accumulate information about successful decisions made
   and use them to solve similar problems in the future. The benefit of
   this approach is the ability to predict the production situation over
   time, rational distribution of technological resources, reducing
   equipment downtime, streamlining the routes of production tasks and
   determining the stages of acquiring the necessary materials and
   components. It increases the competitiveness of the enterprise and
   ensures its economic stability.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BIM (building information modelling) has gained wider acceptance in the
   AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry. Conversion
   from 3D point cloud data to vector BIM data remains a challenging and
   labour-intensive process, but particularly relevant during various
   stages of a project lifecycle. While the challenges associated with
   processing very large 3D point cloud datasets are widely known, there is
   a pressing need for intelligent geometric feature extraction and
   reconstruction algorithms for automated point cloud processing. Compared
   to outdoor scene reconstruction, indoor scenes are challenging since
   they usually contain high amounts of clutter. This dataset comprises the
   indoor point cloud obtained by scanning four different rooms (including
   a hallway): two office workspaces, a workshop, and a laboratory
   including a water tank. The scanned space is located at the Electrical
   and Computer Engineering department of the Faculty of Engineering of the
   University of Porto. The dataset is fully labelled, containing major
   structural elements like walls, floor, ceiling, windows, and doors, as
   well as furniture, movable objects, clutter, and scanning noise. The
   dataset also contains an as-built BIM that can be used as a reference,
   making it suitable for being used in Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM
   applications. For demonstration purposes, a Scan-vs-BIM change detection
   application is described, detailing each of the main data processing
   steps. Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7948116 Dataset License:

Volume = {96},

Abstract = {Integration plays a key role in ecodesign, with its concept defined as
   incorporating environmental aspects into projects and product
   development process of businesses with a life cycle perspective.
   Assuming the lack of a comprehensive integration framework in accordance
   with the principles of innovation management, this study aims to fill
   this research gap. The research method, based on a review of the
   worldwide literature, used two databases and other sources, classifying
   and prioritising publications from primary sources. The result was a set
   of 52 models which was then analysed by encoding the information content
   according to key variables. Accordingly, a conceptual framework that
   combines scientific constructs and best practices with five integration
   principles was created. 1: a three level systemic approach (macro, meso
   and micro scales), integrating ``top-down{''} and ``bottom up{''}
   initiatives. 2: at macro level, strategy and goals for innovation and
   environmental sustainability. 3: at ``meso{''} level, formal
   incorporation of environmental requirements in the product development
   process and portfolio management. 4: at ``micro{''} level,
   implementation of customised ecodesign tools and integration of
   environmental aspects into project management. 5: in addition to the
   three levels, a transversal approach focused on change management and
   the ``soft side{''} of ecodesign, emphasising the company's culture and
   human factors in a multifunctional vision. The conceptual model is
   proposed as a synthesis of main theoretical contributions found in the
   surveyed literature, in a systemic perspective. It is a path towards
   more effective ecodesign integration, building on fundamental principles
   of innovation management coupled with environmental sustainability
   knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the way we plan,
   design, execute, and monitor the built environment. Various stakeholders
   in different compartments are brought under one umbrella to function as
   an integrated team in BIM concept. The construction industry is
   gradually evolving to a manufacturing and product delivery process by
   collaborating in a multidisciplinary environment where design for
   manufacturability and assembly takes precedence. Off-site construction
   methods like pre-engineered, pre-cast, and modular technology are being
   adopted in many large span and high-rise building projects due to its
   cost effectiveness in large volume. Optimization of targeted values viz
   manufacturability, assembly, schedule, lifecycle cost, and
   sustainability becomes critical to ensure a smooth execution and maximum
   value generation of the project. Design for a specific target value
   according to the utility has been an evolutionary process. The objective
   of the study is to investigate the impact of BIM in managing and
   minimizing change orders by design optimization through visualization
   during the planning process in off-site construction. The study also
   examines the various factors influencing the smooth interface from
   design to construction and critically examine the bottlenecks in
   achieving a near perfect transformation to manufactured construction.
   Design for Assembly (DfA) approach gives the stakeholders more rationale
   inputs for monitoring and decision making in a more controlled
   environment of off-site construction. Design optimization in off-site
   construction is achieved as a byproduct of the DfA process when real
   time cost visualization is integrated into BIM framework. Collaboration
   of disciplines and optimization of resources can make the
   design-construction interface hitch free to ensure a near perfect BIM
   execution.},

Abstract = {Having the aim of promoting the application of BIM-Building Information
   Modeling-in the railway sector, this paper's main objective is to
   analyze the BIM implementation in the particular case of rail track
   rehabilitation and inspection. BIM enables the computational development
   of projects during their lifecycle including all the phases.
   Three-dimensional (3D) modeling using Civil 3D (R) software was applied
   to the rehabilitation of a rail track in service. The following tasks
   were carried out: (1) the modeling of the geometry of the railway
   infrastructure; and (2) the capacity analysis to extract diverse
   information from the model, in particular the geometric parameters of
   the rail track: gauge and transversal leveling. Revit (R) software was
   also used to model the project. Families were created relating to the
   sleepers and fastenings and to the rails. Other rail track components,
   such as the ballast, sub-ballast, geosynthetics, and foundation, were
   generated as slab layers in the infrastructure component. In order to
   create a four-dimensional (4D) model that includes the time factor,
   Navisworks (R) software was used. The 4D model allows for simulation of
   the rehabilitation sequence of the rail track, including the application
   of geotextile and geogrid under the ballast layer. It was concluded that
   the use of the 3D model can present limitations to the implementation of
   the BIM methodology, particularly with respect to interoperability in
   the transference of models between softwares. Regarding the inspection
   and maintenance of the rail track, some limitations were observed in the
   storage and processing of relevant information.},

Title = {Eco-Innovative Construction: Integrating Green Roofs Design within the
   BIM Framework},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research delves into the integration of green roofs elements and
   parameters with Building Information Modeling (BIM), a pivotal
   advancement in sustainable urban construction. Aligning with the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 11, this study
   explores how this integration can address global challenges like climate
   change and resource depletion. Using the Dynamo Visual Programming
   Language within Autodesk Revit, this research develops a computational
   modeling approach for green roofs, focusing on their thermal and
   structural characteristics under varied environmental conditions. Key
   findings demonstrate the significant influence of substrate and drainage
   material combinations on green roofs' thermal performance, highlighting
   the need for tailored designs based on climatic conditions. This study
   also emphasizes the importance of considering structural performance in
   both dry and saturated conditions for overall building integrity. This
   research identifies gaps in current practices, such as limited focus on
   specific green roof materials and reliance on certain software tools,
   suggesting the need for broader material selection and software
   adaptability. Future research directions include expanding material
   selections, exploring diverse environmental conditions, and integrating
   green roofs elements and parameters with various BIM software platforms.
   This study's implications extend to stakeholders in the construction
   industry, offering a framework for architects, urban planners, and
   policymakers to design and implement green roofs aligned with
   environmental goals. This work contributes to the field by proposing a
   novel approach to sustainable construction, integrating ecological
   design with digital technology, and setting a new benchmark in the
   integration of green roofs design with BIM. By addressing these aspects,
   this research paves the way for future developments in sustainable urban
   construction, enhancing the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience
   of urban communities in line with global sustainability objectives.},

Title = {BIM for FM: Information Requirements to Support HVAC-Related Corrective
   Maintenance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Troubleshooting HVAC-related problems is one of the significant
   activities of facilities management (FM), in which the services directly
   affect occupants' satisfaction, health, and productivity. Because of the
   complexity of modern HVAC systems and the lack of apparent causes when
   HVAC-related problems occur, HVAC mechanics need to collect various
   facility-specific information items to identify the real cause. The
   current practice lacks systematic approaches for identifying what
   specific facility information HVAC mechanics should check for in a given
   work order. Building information models (BIMs) have been used to
   exchange facilities' lifecycle information, and automated approaches can
   be developed to retrieve required information for facility maintenance.
   The first step toward developing such an approach is to understand what
   information needs to be included in the BIMs that are used during the
   facility operation phase (i.e., operational BIM) from the perspective of
   HVAC troubleshooting, which is the focus of the research presented in
   this paper. The research method includes shadowing, interviews, and
   focus groups with HVAC mechanics from three FM groups, and the
   exploration of existing literature and current computerized systems used
   by HVAC mechanics. The contribution of this research work is the
   identification of a generic set of information requirements that should
   be included in operational BIMs for HVAC troubleshooting. The findings
   are beneficial for future research studies that enable integration of
   facilities maintenance information with BIMs and building automation
   systems for FM purposes, support standardization efforts for data
   exchange in the architectural/engineering/construction and FM industry,
   and are valuable to help practitioners understand what information and
   data sources need to be captured and made available for better
   management of HVAC maintenance. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {The evolution from ``document-centric{''} to ``data-centric{''} and
   ``model-centric{''} information leveraging structured data and
   model-based approaches is at the heart of digital engineering
   transformational efforts underway across industry and government. It is
   these approaches that pave the way for data lakes, Authoritative Sources
   of Truth (ASOTs), and systems-of-systems interoperability and the
   corresponding transformational benefits thereof. Such benefits include
   increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability,
   real-time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly)
   acceleration of the time-to-value and time-to-insights associated with
   engineering products and analyses. The longer-term benefits of
   reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.
   For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS)
   activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide
   engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support
   critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle. The SMA
   community often operate in parallel with engineering activities, for
   which information exchange with relevant context is paramount. Far too
   often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the
   robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated
   with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and
   reporting.
   This paper provides an overview of how NASA's Office of Safety and
   Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance,
   and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the
   benefits emerging in this new digital era. A roadmap for achieving this
   digital future is presented along with key building blocks involving use
   and implementation of concepts such as: Objectives-Hierarchies,
   Objective-Driven Requirements, Accepted Standards, Safety and Assurance
   Cases, data digitization (i.e., ontologies, structured data, and
   model-centric data), FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, \&
   Reusable) and/or FAIRUST (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable,
   Understandable, Secure, and Trusted) principles {[}1]. This paper also
   describes how OSMA, leveraging the Agency's overall commitment to
   Digital Transformation (DT), is using the power of Policy, ``Digital{''}
   Domain representation, Product Evolution, and Community Outreach and
   Engagement as part of a strategic vision and roadmap to evolve and
   transform its SMA organizations to become better able to serve its
   stakeholders and customers. Future publications will elaborate on these
   building blocks and deeper concepts.},

Abstract = {Buildings have a significant impact on global sustainability. During the
   past decades, a wide variety of studies have been conducted throughout
   the building lifecycle for improving the building performance.
   Data-driven approach has been widely adopted owing to less detailed
   building information required and high computational efficiency for
   online applications. Recent advances in information technologies and
   data science have enabled convenient access, storage, and analysis of
   massive on-site measurements, bringing about a new big-data-driven
   research paradigm. This paper presents a critical review of data-driven
   methods, particularly those methods based on larger datasets, for
   building energy modeling and their practical applications for improving
   building performances. This paper is organized based on the four
   essential phases of big-data-driven modeling, i.e., data preprocessing,
   model development, knowledge post-processing, and practical applications
   throughout the building lifecycle. Typical data analysis and application
   methods have been summarized and compared at each stage, based upon
   which in-depth discussions and future research directions have been
   presented. This review demonstrates that the insights obtained from big
   building data can be extremely helpful for enriching the existing
   knowledge repository regarding building energy modeling. Furthermore,
   considering the ever-increasing development of smart buildings and
   IoT-driven smart cities, the big data-driven research paradigm will
   become an essential supplement to existing scientific research methods
   in the building sector.},

Abstract = {Employer's Information Requirements (EIR) is a key document for the
   successful delivery of construction projects using Building Information
   Modeling (BIM). EIR sets out the information to be delivered and the
   standards and processes to be adopted by the suppliers as part of their
   project delivery approach. The concept of EIR has been developed by the
   UK BIM Task Group as a holistic framework for the UK construction
   industry to deliver the UK construction client requirements in projects
   using BIM. It includes a set of requirements and guidelines in three
   macro areas namely, technical, management and commercial. EIR, which are
   specific to the construction industry in Qatar, do not exist yet despite
   BIM is increasingly adopted across the Qatari construction industry.
   However, construction projects using BIM in Qatar adopts various aspects
   in technical, management and commercial areas. In this paper, we analyze
   the current BIM practice in Qatar and compare the findings against the
   items of the three EIR's areas. The overarching aim is to assess the
   potential of delivering EIR in BIM based construction projects in Qatar.
   To accomplish this aim, major construction industry players (clients,
   consultants, contractors), representing a significant part of Qatar
   construction industry, were interviewed about the three EIR's areas and
   their items. The results showed discrepancies in addressing EIR and
   varied levels of readiness in delivering the different EIR's areas and
   items. The paper has proposed general guidelines for delivering EIR in
   Qatar which are informed by the survey and current international EIR
   standards.},

   increasingly applied on existing buildings to ensure that performance
   requirements are fulfilled during building service-life. LBPA is a
   multi-disciplinary and information-intense process that requires
   computational tools for information management and decision support. We
   have previously developed a computational reference model (CLIP-Core)
   that supports various component-based LBPA practices. When CLIP-Core is
   considered to be used, it needs to be adapted to the specific context it
   addresses. We developed two such domain models, CLIP EPI-CREM and
   CLIP-CMU, for two existing LBPA practices. This paper addresses the
   evaluation of CLIP-Core and its potential in supporting various
   requirements. Hereto, we first discuss CLIP-Core and the two domain
   models. Then we present the evaluation results based on the domain
   models and their development processes. Finally we discuss guidelines
   for extending CLIP-Core and recommend technologies and alternative
   architectures that can increase CLIP-Core's usability. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {The usage phase often dominates the lifetime environmental impact of
   energy and material consuming products. Improper human behaviors could
   increase the environmental impacts during the use stage of the product's
   life cycle. The use phase of desktop fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   printers involves large energy and material consumption. In university
   makerspaces, many novices choose to use desktop FDM printers because of
   its easy operation, but novices often make improper design and operation
   decisions. The human errors increase the fabrication failures leading to
   higher material and energy consumption. Therefore, human behaviors
   should be investigated in order to identify the causes of fabrication
   failures in an open studio environment. Three types of failure causes
   are studied, which are designer error, operator error and machine error.
   In this research, computer-aided design (CAD) models, printing settings,
   user experience information and printing results were tracked and
   analyzed. In addition, the energy and material consumption were recorded
   from the printings. These data are analyzed to identify the key factors
   affecting printing failure rates and to improve the sustainability and
   efficiency of desktop FDM. From the collected data, a failure rate of
   41.1\% was observed. The failures caused by human error accounted for
   26.3\% of the total prints, which shows that human behaviors could
   influence the environmental impacts of FDM. For the factors impacting
   failure rates, user's experience level and printing parameters were
   analyzed. We found that that experience did not result in higher
   expertise or lower failure rates. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {In December 2012 ENIservizi (the Italian multi-national energy agency
   operating in many countries), after the Earthquake that occurred in
   April 2009, decided to undertake the project `Re-start from Collemaggio'
   with the aim of giving new hope to the L'Aquila community, funding
   around 14 million Euro to restore the Basilica di Collemaggio. The
   Superintendence Office carried on the restoration project with the
   scientific support of the University degli Studi de L'Aquila and the
   University La Sapienza di Roma, under the coordination of the
   Politecnico di Milano. ENIservizi, aware of the BIM potential in the
   complex building and infrastructure domain in the world, required an
   advanced HBIM from the laser scanner and photogrammetric surveying to
   support the diagnostic analysis, the design project, the tender and the
   restoration itself, today still on course.
   Plans and vertical sections were delivered (2012) starting from the
   surveying campaigns (February and June 2013), together with the first
   HBIM advancement from the end of 2012 in support of the
   preliminary-definitive-executive steps of the restoration design project
   (2013-14-15). Five years later, this paper tries to make a synthesis of
   the different lessons learnt, in addition to the positive and critical
   aspects relating HBIM feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the
   challenging restoration work.
   In particular, the Collemaggio BIM experience anticipated the new
   Italian Public Procurement Legislation (D.Lgs 50/2016, Nuovo Codice
   degli Appalti pubblici) aligned with to the EUPPD 24/2014: the EU
   Directive on Public Procurement asked all the 28 EU countries to adopt
   building informative modelling by February 2016 in order to support the
   whole LCM (Life Cycle Management), starting from the project and the
   intervention, through rewarding scores or mandatory regulations. Many
   analyses foresees to save from around 5\% to 15\% of the overall
   investment by adopting mature BIM (Level 3 to 5), particularly 4D
   remotely controlled BIM in support of the LCM, as in the case of
   maintenance and management process. The tender for Basilica restoration
   was published in 2015: the process was not developed enough to introduce
   selective criteria based on BIM adoption by the Construction Industry
   due to the lack of legislation at that time and the lack of BIM skills
   among the companies. Nevertheless ENIservizi also separately funded
   aside the HBIM of the Basilica to tackle an advanced BIM able to address
   decision-making processes in the heritage domain among the different
   actors: to support operators, architects, structural engineers, economic
   computation, construction site management and restoration, the
   theoretical and practical approach adopted by the HBIM, overcame the
   current logic based on sequential LoD (from simplex to complex, from the
   preliminary to the executive design) that is typical of new
   constructions in favour of a complex LoD approach that could guarantee
   management of the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each component
   and the maximum degree of knowledge in order to derive the decisions
   from the starting phases of the project. On the lesson learnt from this
   experience, the process of updating the current codification criteria
   (UNI11337-2009) was started with a draft proposal stimulating a debate
   for the future of HBIM adoption.},

Abstract = {Purpose Given the ongoing digital transformation, building information
   modeling (BIM) has great potential to create a collaborative environment
   in the whole lifecycle of the built asset, from inception to
   decommissioning. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper relates current developments in
   Quebec with regard to the use of BIM for asset management (AM). The
   steps taken by three public organizations to develop their capabilities
   and take advantage of new possibilities are presented. The main
   methodological approach is based on participant observation, through
   case studies complemented by a questionnaire. Findings This paper
   reports on results and analysis of an important module of a broader
   research project on the impact of new technologies and collaborative
   methods for projects and AM. The results of this first research module
   points to the importance of using pilot projects to develop a continuous
   improvement approach, where feedback loops from projects support the
   development of AM capabilities and culture. Another important finding is
   the importance of sharing experience for the three public organizations
   involved. Originality/value The main contributions of this paper are to
   document this overarching research program and to gain deeper insights
   by reflexively considering the steps taken and the ones ahead for the
   quest to enhance the transfer of information for built assets at the end
   of projects to the operations and maintenance phase and to use BIM for
   operation.},

   Construction Industry},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Carbon emissions present a pressing challenge to the traditional
   construction industry, urging a fundamental shift towards more
   sustainable practices and materials. Recent advances in sensors, data
   fusion techniques, and artificial intelligence have enabled integrated
   digital technologies (e.g., digital twins) as a promising trend to
   achieve emission reduction and net-zero. While digital twins in the
   construction sector have shown rapid growth in recent years, most
   applications focus on the improvement of productivity, safety and
   management. There is a lack of critical review and discussion of
   state-of-the-art digital twins to improve sustainability in this sector,
   particularly in reducing carbon emissions. This paper reviews the
   existing research where digital twins have been directly used to enhance
   sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a building (including
   design, construction, operation and maintenance, renovation, and
   demolition). Additionally, we introduce a conceptual framework for this
   industry, which involves the elements of the entire digital twin
   implementation process, and discuss the challenges faced during
   deployment, along with potential research opportunities. A
   proof-of-concept example is also presented to demonstrate the validity
   of the proposed conceptual framework and potential of digital twins for
   enhanced sustainability. This study aims to inspire more
   forward-thinking research and innovation to fully exploit digital twin
   technologies and transform the traditional construction industry into a
   more sustainable sector.},

Abstract = {Researches on Supply chain management application of construction
   industry have spread out gradually in China in recent years. But it is
   still very fragmented and preliminary. Separated and specific studies
   have not lead to a systematic framework. This article analyzes the
   development of construction industry and its existing problems, explains
   the significance of study on construction supply chain management
   framework and analyzes its structure and scope in details. It is pointed
   out that the framework of construction supply chain management should
   include three main aspects. The first is fundamental theories study of
   construction supply chain management, such as: Williamson's transaction
   cost theory, public goods management theory, the principal-agent theory,
   corporate governance theory, corporate resource and capacity theory and
   etc. The second is researches on construction supply chain management
   application methods and models, including work flow management
   (preparation work, time, laborers, space, materials, equipments,
   connecting work, construction conditions), capital flow management
   (vertical financing, lateral financing, capital market), information
   flow management (data, information, knowledge), value flow management
   (building life cycle value management, project management methods,
   internal management of corporate). The third is performance evaluation
   study of construction supply chain management, including the research of
   the evaluation indicator system and evaluation methods about market or
   environment, construction companies and construction projects. Study of
   construction supply chain management framework is very important. It
   would lead to a systematic study on supply chain management theory
   application in construction industry, improve application of foreign
   construction supply chain management experience and research results,
   enhance the confidence of construction business community and government
   for supply chain management theory, maintain the order of construction
   market and sustainable healthy development of construction industry.},

Abstract = {Building secure systems is difficult for many reasons. This paper deals
   with two of the main challenges: (i) the lack of security expertise in
   development teams and (ii) the inadequacy of existing methodologies to
   support developers who are not security experts. The security standard
   ISO 14508 Common Criteria (CC) together with secure design techniques
   such as UMLsec can provide the security expertise, knowledge, and
   guidelines that are needed. However, security expertise and guidelines
   are not stated explicitly in the CC. They are rather phrased in security
   domain terminology and difficult to understand for developers. This
   means that some general security and secure design expertise are
   required to fully take advantage of the CC and UMLsec. In addition,
   there is the problem of tracing security requirements and objectives
   into solution design, which is needed for proof of requirements
   fulfilment. This paper describes a security requirements engineering
   methodology called SecReq. SecReq combines three techniques: the CC, the
   heuristic requirements editor HeRA, and UMLsec. SecReq makes systematic
   use of the security engineering knowledge contained in the CC and
   UMLsec, as well as security-related heuristics in the HeRA tool. The
   integrated SecReq method supports early detection of security-related
   issues (HeRA), their systematic refinement guided by the CC, and the
   ability to trace security requirements into UML design models. A
   feedback loop helps reusing experience within SecReq and turns the
   approach into an iterative process for the secure system life-cycle,
   also in the presence of system evolution.},

Abstract = {Supply chain performance measurement systems (SCPMSs) are experiencing a
   new life in business practice thanks to new technologies that allow the
   collecting, integrating and sharing of information among multiple supply
   chain partners. However, studies that truly investigate performance
   measurement beyond a single firm's boundaries are still limited. With
   the purpose of revamping SCPMSs as a relevant research topic, we conduct
   a systematic review of the literature. To this end, we firstly provide a
   clear and up-to-date definition of SCPMSs, which sets the boundary of
   the study. Secondly, we perform a systematic review of academic articles
   published in peer-reviewed international journals, mostly in the domains
   of supply chain management and performance measurement. A final sample
   of 92 articles published from 1998 to 2015 constitutes the knowledge
   base of the study. The results show the publication pattern over time
   and provide evidence about the journals, the methodology adopted and the
   content elements (the SCPMS frameworks presented and the scope and phase
   of the measurement process). We synthesize the research state of the art
   and present a detailed research agenda for future scientific
   contributions. In particular, we envisage a theory-testing approach
   concerning the relatively more mature component of SCPMSs (i.e. supplier
   PMSs) from a life cycle perspective as well as an
   exploratory/theory-building approach concerning the other
   under-investigated components (i.e. customer PMSs, multi-tier SCPMSs and
   many-to-many SCPMSs).},

Title = {Review of reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions through
   digital twin in built environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The construction industry is a major contributor to environmental
   degradation and is responsible for substantial energy consumption,
   carbon emissions, and resource depletion. In response, the adoption of
   advanced technologies, like Digital Twins (DT), has emerged as a
   critical strategy to address these sustainability challenges. DTs create
   virtual replicas of physical assets, enabling real-time monitoring,
   optimisation, and informed decision-making, thus enhancing
   sustainability by improving building performance and energy efficiency
   while reducing waste. This study explores the application of DT
   technology in promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions
   within the construction industry. It aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview of current DT implementations and identify key challenges to
   broader adoption. Using a combination of scientometric analysis and
   systematic literature review, the study examines the potential of DT to
   address environmental sustainability in construction while highlighting
   areas for future research and development. The analysis reveals
   increasing interest in DTs, with a rise in publications from 2018 to
   2024, led by Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. The literature
   shows a strong focus on integrating DT with building information
   modeling (BIM) to optimise energy use and achieve sustainability goals
   across a building's lifecycle. However, challenges remain, including
   data integration issues, a lack of standardised protocols, and the need
   for a more skilled workforce. By addressing challenges and enhancing
   DT-BIM integration, the construction industry can minimise its
   environmental impact and progress towards sustainability. The study's
   findings offer vital insights for future research and industry practices
   to meet global sustainability targets effectively.},

Abstract = {Within the global economy, the built environment makes a major
   contribution to economic activity and has a significant impact on
   sustainability. In addition, the built environment plays a significant
   social role as it influences where we live along with how we work,
   entertain, and learn. Even though the built environment plays such a
   significant social and economic role, it has been slow in adopting
   emerging technologies to make the way we design, build, utilize, and
   decommission more efficient while having less of a negative impact on
   the environment. This paper explores how we can integrate data science
   and Cyber Physical Systems into the built environment to achieve greater
   efficiencies. This paper introduces some of the industry challenges
   along with an overview of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper
   includes qualitative interview data that is driving the development of a
   working model that integrates emerging technologies to achieve budget,
   schedule, and sustainability efficiencies. Finally, the paper discusses
   how it is envisaged that integrating these technologies will improve
   decision-making within the built environment lifecycle.},

Abstract = {The main function of building envelope is to protect people who live in
   the building from climatic effects by providing a comfortable
   microclimate and lighting in the house. Most residential multi-apartment
   buildings in the Russian Federation were built before mid-1990s with low
   energy efficiency and, often, low quality. The situation is aggravated
   by the lack of timely repair, which adversely affects the performance of
   these buildings. The sphere of individual housing construction also
   lacks of quality control at all stages of the life cycle of a building.
   Builders ignore important features of the building design, or the
   construction works are carried out by unqualified workers, without
   sufficient quality control. This results in increased energy consumption
   during the operation of the building, compromised microclimate in the
   house, violation of environmental requirements, and, in the absence of
   timely repairs, loss of the bearing capacity of the structural elements
   of the building. Important areas of development in the field of housing
   construction are to energy efficiency, improvement of the system of
   operation and maintenance of buildings, transparency in the operational
   performance of buildings for owners and investors. To obtain such
   benefits, it is necessary to develop a strategy for implementation of
   intelligent technologies and smart engineering systems to improve energy
   efficiency, automate operational processes and create an `intelligent'
   profile of a building. The article presents a study of energy efficiency
   of buildings and justifies smart management of real estate objects, in
   order to save resources and timely respond to the decline in their
   operational qualities. In the modern conditions of market economy, when
   most of the housing stock is privately owned, it is necessary to create
   a modern economic and organizational mechanism for overhauls,
   reconstruction and modernization of building with the use of BIM
   technologies. The result of the overhaul and reconstruction works is the
   restoration and improvement of the operational characteristics of
   buildings. An overhaul or a reconstruction is advisable if the technical
   condition of the building has been compromised and effective operation
   and maintenance are impossible. The proposed methodological and
   practical recommendations aim at implementing the organizational and
   economic mechanism for managing the quality of overhauls, reconstruction
   and modernization of real estate objects, meet the emerging need for
   developing practical measures to revitalize the activities in the
   housing market and to improve the quality life of the population.},

Abstract = {Today's global challenge is to innovate and digitize the learning
   process, bringing a qualitatively higher form of education, especially
   in engineering. In the field of construction, the 21st century brought a
   3D virtual environment for building design as well as new software tools
   for modeling and simulating the technical and technological parameters
   of building structures. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   increasingly used in the construction lifecycle. Progress in the field
   of digitization of construction needs to be transformed into teaching
   specialized subjects of bachelor and master education.
   The aim of the educational activities presented in the paper was to
   create suitable conditions for the implementation of 3D modeling in the
   subject of Building Process Technology at the bachelor level of higher
   education at the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Technical
   University in Kosice (Slovakia). Teaching innovation has required
   changes in both technical and staffing of the learning process.
   Educational activities are concretized on an example of a construction
   exercise where students solve the process of assembling the reinforced
   concrete structure of a building.
   In innovative teaching conditions, students can better understand the

Title = {A Multivariate Analysis of the Variables Impacting the Level of BIM
   Expertise of Professionals in the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) Industries of the Developing World Using
   Nonparametric Tests},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) mandates are becoming more
   widespread because BIM allows design and construction teams to operate
   more productively and also enables them to collect the data they
   generate during the process for use in operations and maintenance tasks.
   As a result, professionals in the architecture, engineering and
   construction (AEC) industries are expected to possess excellent BIM
   expertise. Despite the fact that the developing world has largely not
   adopted BIM, many studies have been conducted on BIM usage, awareness,
   drivers and barriers with a focus on the developing world. Numerous
   studies have pointed to the professionals' lack of BIM expertise in the
   developing world's AEC sector as a major barrier to BIM deployment.
   Nevertheless, no research has been conducted to assess the variables
   impacting the level of BIM expertise among professionals. After a
   detailed review of the literature, the study developed five study
   hypotheses and created a conceptual model to help assess the variables
   impacting the level of BIM expertise of professionals in the AEC
   industry in the developing world. After that, a questionnaire survey was
   carried out to collect data from 103 seasoned professionals in the
   Ghanaian construction industry. Nonparametric tests, such as the
   Kruskal-Wallis, pairwise post hoc Dunn, Mann-Whitney, Pearson's
   correlation and the partial least squares structural equation modeling
   (PLS SEM) tests, were adopted to assess the relationships between the
   level of BIM expertise of professionals (BE) and the following
   variables: (1) profession (P), (2) the frequency of BIM use by
   professionals (BF), (3) the highest dimension of BIM adopted by AEC
   firms and companies (BD), (4) professionals' perception of BIM (PB) and
   (5) the BIM implementation barriers (BIMIBs). P, BF, BD and PB were
   found to have a substantial impact on the level of BIM expertise
   acquired by professionals. With regards to professionals' perception of
   the BIM software and process, only one (PB3-BIM is not useful to our
   company at the moment) out of ten of them was found to have a
   significant impact on BE, highlighting the impact of employers on the
   level of BIM expertise of professionals. In addition, the study
   discovered that any resolution made in an attempt to tackle the lack
   of/insufficient level of BIM expertise among professionals would prove
   futile without significant effort from the higher education sector (HES)
   of the developing world and the entire world at large. The study's
   conceptual, empirical, managerial and theoretical implications and
   findings would serve as a roadmap for researchers, professionals and
   academics in developing nations as they endeavor to seek more ways of
   increasing BIM expertise among their professionals and to encourage BIM
   usage throughout the project lifecycle.},

Title = {The business value of BIM for asset owners: a cross-case analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {469-486},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate and identify the
   activity systems that drive building information modelling (BIM)
   business value in asset management (AM). The utilisation of BIM has
   widened in scope, functionality, flexibility and interoperability to
   support the AM business process. However, research concerning BIM
   business value in AM has been inadequate despite its considerable
   potential and significance in the attainment of organisational
   objectives. The realisation of BIM business value requires a concerted
   effort by the asset owner to be able to determine and appraise the
   critical activities that drive business value in AM.
   Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative research
   approach based on a multi-case study strategy that aimed to identify the
   key business processes that drive BIM business value in AM. The study
   involved a three-stage research design using interviews and document
   analysis to facilitate a cross-case analysis from the perspective of the
   activity systems and dimensions of BIM governance. Findings The paper
   identified six critical activity systems that drive BIM business value
   for an asset owner: BIM strategy, contract management, lifecycle
   management, maintenance management, work-order management and value
   realisation management. The study found that the most developed activity
   system is the BIM strategy, and the least is value realisation
   management across all cases. Also, the paper points out that the most
   proficient BIM governance dimension is process, and the least is people
   across the three cases. The study noted that the ability of an asset
   owner to realise BIM business value has maturity undertones and that the
   asset owner could derive BIM business value, if the six activity systems
   are effectively executed and continuously improved to an advanced stage
   of maturity. Originality/value An original contribution of the study is
   the development of the understanding of asset owners in relation to the
   discovery of key activity systems that drive BIM business value in AM.
   Another significant contribution of this paper is the demonstration of a
   novel approach to evaluate organisational maturity of asset owners from
   the perspectives of the activity systems and BIM governance dimensions
   of people, process and technology.},

Title = {LOD OBJECT CONTENT SPECIFICATION FOR MANUFACTURERS WITHIN THE UK USING
   THE IDM STANDARD},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {80-103},
Abstract = {UK manufacturers are gradually embracing the adoption of Level 2
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) standards (3D models and embedded
   data) within their product model elements. However, these are not always
   well defined due to inaccuracies related to the scope and the content of
   the model attributes. Product Data Templates (PDTs) are currently being
   created as a solution to provide structured model element data to
   manufacturer's clients. However, defining PDTs data has been
   particularly challenging for manufacturers, as there is a scarcity of
   content knowledge which includes BIM uses (i. e. electrical design) and
   processes (i.e. cable tray sizing) that support client's lifecycle
   processes. Similarly, few studies have investigated the Level of
   Development (LOD) that manufacturers should use to create their model
   element product data. In this paper, we therefore propose a generic
   industry approach to create and maintain model element product data at
   different LODs using the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and we
   evaluate it for future improvement. The IDM can capture processes at the
   informational (i.e. attributes), behavioural (i.e. project stage),
   organisational (i.e. actor), and functional (i.e. business rules) level.
   A case study on Made to Stock Products for the Design use has been
   created to drawn recommendations for the behavioural and informational
   IDM perspective. In order implement the LOD on an industry basis and for
   its ease of use, we recommend matching the IDM Exchange models to a LOD
   graphical standard and keeping the BPMN free of stage bindings. This
   issue should be further studied for standardisation purposes. The
   benefit of this approach is that manufacturers could use the IDM to
   create product model element data in relation to their client's
   processes at different LODs for its inclusion within BIM Information
   Systems (IS).},

   Components Using 3D Laser Scanning and Building Information Model},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prefabricated steel box girders (SBGs) are widely adopted in bridge
   engineering due to their light weight and low lifecycle cost. To
   smoothly assemble SBG components on a construction site, it is necessary
   to inspect their geometric quality and ensure that all the as-is SBG
   components have the correct dimensions. However, the traditional
   inspection method is time-consuming and error-prone. This study
   developed a non-contact geometric quality assessment technique based on
   3D laser scanning to accurately assess the locations and dimensions of
   SBG components. First, a robust normal-based region-growing algorithm
   was developed to divide the SBG components into segments with different
   labels. The scanned data related to the T ribs were then extracted
   through the proposed subtraction algorithm after the identification of
   the steel cabin. Lastly, the required items for geometric quality
   inspection were calculated based on the extracted as-is SBG components.
   The feasibility of the proposed geometric quality assessment method was
   validated through a real SBG project. Field test results showed that the
   developed inspection technique could assess the geometric quality of
   prefabricated SBG components in a more accurate and efficient manner
   compared to traditional measurement approaches.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was the analysis and simulation of the life cycle
   of a bifurcating thunderstorm that passed over Beijing, China, on 22
   July 2015. Data from 150 surface weather sites and an S-band radar were
   used in conjunction withWRFsimulations that used its multilevel Building
   Environment Parameterization (BEP) urbanization option. The Urban-case
   simulation used Beijing land-use information, and the NoUrban one
   replaced all urban areas by croplands. The Urban case correctly
   simulated both the observed weak 10-m winds over Beijing (<1.0ms(-1))
   and the weak 2-m urban heat island (<0.5 degrees C). Observed radar and
   rain gauge data, as well as the Urban-case results, all showed
   precipitation bifurcation around Beijing, with maximumaccumulations in
   convergent flow areas on either side of the city. The Urban case also
   reproduced the observed precipitation minima over the urban area and in
   a downwind rain shadow. The observations and Urban-case results both
   also showed bifurcated flow, even when the storm was still upwind of
   Beijing. The subsequent bifurcated precipitation areas thus each moved
   along a preexisting flow branch. Urban-case vertical sections showed
   downward motion in the divergence areas over the urban core and upward
   motions over the lateral convergence zones, both up to 6 km. Given that
   the NoUrban case showed none of these features, these differences
   demonstrate how the impact of cities can extend upward into deep local
   convection. Additional case-study simulations are needed to more fully
   understand urban storm bifurcation mechanisms in this and other storms
   for cities in a variety of climates.},

Title = {Critical factors that influence the effectiveness of facility
   maintenance management practice in public university buildings in
   Ethiopia: an exploratory factor analysis},
Journal = {COGENT ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Facility maintenance management (FMM) is essential for ensuring
   long-term values and to sustain project goals throughout the life cycle
   delivery process. However, in underdeveloped nations such as Ethiopia,
   facility maintenance management is an immature and underutilised process
   that requires a holistic intervention for practical improvement. The
   main aim of this study was to identify and prioritise critical factors
   that affect the effectiveness of FMM, with a focus on public
   universities in Ethiopia. Initially, a total of thirty-three (33)
   crucial variables were identified with a systematic literature review
   and desk study. To collect primary data, a survey research design
   approach was utilised using questionnaires and informant interviews. A
   total of seventy-five (75) data sets were obtained from 180 online
   surveys for conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The outcome of
   the study revealed thirteen (13) critical attributes grouped into four
   factors that affect the effectiveness of facility maintenance management
   practises. The final four-factor model includes F1, internal processes
   and organisation; F2, community culture, learning, and growth; F3,
   impacts of design and construction quality; and F4, facility maintenance
   approach and management. This study indicated that facility maintenance
   management practises in public universities in Ethiopia are immature and
   require extensive enhancement. The identified influencing factors
   highlight the need for a comprehensive intervention to promote improved
   facility maintenance management practises and applications in Ethiopia.
   Further research is needed to analyse a wider range of attributes and
   data using confirmatory factor analysis.},

Title = {Developing a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin
   technologies to revamp building operation and maintenance processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has
   seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to
   their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication
   throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and
   maintenance (O \& M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption
   is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities
   during the O \& M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case
   study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional
   practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O \& M phase using four
   geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT
   technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM
   activities by providing real-time status of the building assets.
   However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and
   data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a
   bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider
   implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O \& M phase
   of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it
   provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities
   during the O \& M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced
   conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM
   decision-making processes.},

Title = {Planning operations before market launch for balancing time-to-market
   and risks in pharmaceutical supply chains},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {161},
Pages = {129-139},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Shorter product life cycles and the resulting increase in new product
   introductions boost the importance of product launch operations. In the
   pharmaceutical sector, product launch operations are of particular
   importance, as companies seek to reduce time-to-market to better exploit
   patent protection. Large volumes of product need to be ready to fill the
   downstream supply chain immediately at market launch. Building up the
   required inventory is, however, connected to several risks. In addition
   to the risk associated with the lack of demand information for a new
   product, there are several risks unique to the pharmaceutical sector.
   After approval by central authorities such as the FDA or EMA, a new drug
   still needs to receive market authorization, which is in most cases
   granted by some local authorities - in Europe, for example, by more than
   30 national and regional bodies. The duration of these different market
   authorization processes as well as their outcomes (e.g. price and
   reimbursement levels, requirements of label or leaflet changes) are
   highly uncertain. We develop a two-stage stochastic model to support
   market launch preparation decisions. It trades off the costs of
   accepting these risks, for example by risk packaging before
   authorization, against the lost revenue caused by risk-averse
   operations. The model is applied to a case based on an empirical study.
   Our approach results in significant savings compared to current
   practices. We hereby provide an example of how quantitative methodology
   can provide valuable decision support for product launch operations,
   even when complex regulatory affairs need to be considered. (C) 2014

Title = {A review of vertical closed-loop geothermal heating and cooling systems
   with an Emphasis on the importance of the subsurface},
Journal = {GEOENERGY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {220},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geothermal heat pump (GHP) systems have been established as a proven
   technology for cooling and heating residential, public and commercial
   buildings. There is a geothermal solution to the ambitious goal of
   decarbonizing the space heating and cooling, which is contingent on the
   successful deployment of the GHP technology. This in turn requires
   accurate site characterization, sound design methodologies, effective
   control logic, and short and long-term (life-cycle) performance analysis
   and optimization. In this article, we review the aforementioned aspects
   of the vertical closed-loop GHPs specifically focusing on the important
   role of the subsurface. The basics of GHP technology are introduced
   along with relevant trends and statistics. GHPs are compared with
   similar technologies such as air source heat pumps (ASHP) along with the
   effects of deployment on the grid peak load. We then review the common
   system architectures and the growing trends for deeper boreholes and the
   drivers behind it. Various methods for design, sizing, and simulation of
   GHPs are introduced along with software tools common in research and
   industry. We then move to subsurface characterization, drilling and well
   construction of vertical boreholes. Long-term performance monitoring for
   GHP systems is an important source of information for model validation
   and engineering design and is garnering increasing attention recently.
   Data science is another field that is growing rapidly with its methods
   increasingly utilized in GHP applications. The environmental aspect of
   GHPs is briefly reviewed. Finally, concluding remarks are given to
   summarize the review and highlight the potential of petroleum
   engineering expertise and methods in GHP applications.},

Abstract = {Building automation systems control many aspects of today's buildings -
   lightning control, air condition, shading, access control, and
   surveillance, just to name a few. This diversity and the diversity of
   related technologies and protocols entails that the extension or
   integration of building automation systems requires a major effort. To
   address these challenges, the ITEA3 Building as a Service (BaaS) project
   developed a reference architecture that is based on a service oriented
   approach enhanced with semantic descriptions that aims at model based
   code generation and simple integration of legacy devices.
   In this paper, we present an overview of the BaaS reference architecture
   with a specific focus on the information model and on the envisioned way
   to take advantage of the semantic descriptions for information
   filtering, search and discovery throughout the lifecycle of a building
   automation system.},

Title = {Development of an Inspection, Maintenance and Rehabilitation System for
   Bridge Infrastructures Using Integrated Building Information Modeling,
   Web Server and QR-Code Technologies: A Case Study of Sadr Bridge},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 10},
Abstract = {This paper examined the synergistic integration of the Bridge Management
   System (BMS) into Building Information Modeling (BIM), a robust online
   database, and Quick Response (QR) code technology to enhance the
   efficiency and reliability of bridge infrastructure management. The
   integrated framework leveraged BIM's 3D modeling capabilities, a
   comprehensive online database for data storage and retrieval, and QR
   code technology for real-time tracking and monitoring of bridge
   components. Through a systematic review of the literature, a novel
   framework was introduced that streamlines bridge maintenance,
   inspection, and lifecycle management. The potential benefits, including
   improved asset management, predictive maintenance, and cost savings were
   discussed, while implementation challenges and barriers were addressed.
   To verify the developed framework, it was applied to a case study (Sadr
   Bridge). Subsequently, a questionnaire was administered to project
   employees. The survey results demonstrated that the participants
   believed the proposed framework effectively enhanced facility management
   (FM) practices, receiving high ratings across various metrics,
   particularly in budget allocation (4.73 out of 5). Key performance
   indicators (PIs) based on experts' opinions showed significant
   improvements, including a 17\% reduction in maintenance costs, an 8\%
   decrease in inspection overwork, a 23\% reduction in inspection time,
   and a 41\% reduction in paperwork. Overall, the framework substantially
   improved the accuracy and efficiency of FM practices. In conclusion,
   experts believed that the framework was more effective and accurate in
   bridge maintenance compared to traditional bridge management approaches.
   It offered potential for labor savings and budget optimization and can
   significantly reduce inspection time.},

Title = {A building sector related procedure to assess the relevance of the usage
   phase},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {142-150},
Abstract = {Intention, Goal, Scope, Background. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are
   increasingly used in the building sector as a decision-support tool in
   the design phase of buildings to enable environmentally sound choices of
   materials and products. The practice in Europe of today regarding
   product choices is mainly based on cradle to gate LCAs and is quite
   commonly disregarding the usage phase. The main reason for this is the
   fragmented structure of the building sector in which the application of
   specific materials and products is unknown to the manufacturer. The
   environmental information supplied by the manufacturers to the designers
   of buildings only relates to the production phase, limited to typical
   cradle to gate data. A specific material or product choice can however
   have a considerable impact during the usage phase. Predicting the
   magnitude of an environmental load originating in the usage phase, as
   the result of a building product can in some cases be based on
   information on both product- and building level. To date there are no
   structured procedures for the inclusion of this information in
   LCA-studies, even-though it is desirable to include the full product
   fife cycle when including environmental parameters in a product choice.
   Objective. A procedure for assessing the relevance and the possibility
   to include the usage phase in a structured way is proposed. Considerable
   effort has also been put into explaining the underlying obstacles of
   today's practice in handling the connection between the choice of
   building products and its resulting impacts in the usage phase.
   Methods. The proposed procedure is primary based on experiences and
   findings from a comprehensive study on maintenance of floor coverings,
   together with an inventory of the state of the art regarding LCA in the
   building sector.
   Results and Discussion. The procedure is divided into two steps where
   the first step is a preliminary estimate of the relevance of the usage
   phase in a building product comparison. Based on this step, step two can
   be entered. Step two is a judgement of the possibility to quantify the
   potential environmental loads that can occur in the usage phase. For
   step one, four different types of sources of potential environmental
   loads have been found; emissions from the product to the indoor
   environment, emissions from the product to the outdoor environment,
   influence on the resource flow in a building, and finally the demands
   for maintenance, leading to other recurring loads. For step two, the
   focus in this article is on maintenance, for which a model structure is
   proposed as a base for the development of a model to estimate the
   environmental loads. The three other sources of environmental loads are
   handled more briefly.
   Conclusions. The usage phase should to a larger extend be regarded in a
   product choice situation, when LCA is used as a tool. First, the
   relevance of including the usage phase should be assessed. Second, the
   possibility to estimate the environmental loads should be considered.
   The reason for an exclusion of the usage phase should more clearly be
   explained, if it is due to lack of relevance or data/models.
   Recommendation and Outlook. The proposed procedure shall be regarded as
   a way to obtain preliminary estimates of the relevance and possibilities
   to include the usage phase in a product choice situation. Thereby, the
   handling of the usage phase by the suggested procedure is not a method
   for estimating the environmental loads but rather a procedure for an
   inventory of the relevance and possibility to estimate the environmental
   loads.},

Title = {Active Learning for Well Control Optimization with Surrogate Models},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2668-2688},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Optimization of well controls in waterflooding operations has been
   established as an effective strategy to increase oil recovery efficiency
   and to reduce operating costs. Optimization problems, however, entail
   hundreds of full -scale reservoir simulation runs, which can be
   computationally expensive and impractical for field -scale applications.
   Fit- for-purpose surrogate models present more efficient alternatives
   that can be deployed for faster implementation and to enable real-time
   applications. In recent years, machine learning (ML) -based surrogate
   models have gained traction in building efficient proxy models to
   facilitate reservoir engineering and management workflows. For
   high-dimensional control variables that are frequently encountered in
   life cycle optimization, gradient -based local search methods have
   proven to be the optimization algorithms of choice, especially when
   adjoint models are available to provide the required gradient
   information in a computationally efficient manner. The use of local
   search optimization techniques implies that the surrogate models should
   be locally accurate and adapted to the optimization path that is
   traversed during the iterations. The adaptation can be accomplished
   through active learning, where the training of the surrogate model is
   performed online (throughout the iterations) and tied to the
   optimtization iterations. This paper presents an active learning
   framework that is tuned to the local search nature of the optimization
   problem by updating an initially trained surrogate model based on new
   samples that are generated during the optimization iterations.
   Specifically, at each iteration, the full reservoir simulation model is
   performed to evaluate the true objective function and provide the new
   simulated data to update the surrogate model, thereby enhancing its
   local prediction accuracy. As the optimization progresses, older samples
   that become less relevant to the solution at the current iteration are
   dropped to preserve the local nature of the surrogate model. Various
   aspects of designing an active learning -based proxy model for well
   control optimization are discussed and the framework is applied to
   waterflooding problems to demonstrate its efficiency and superior
   performance compared to the traditional offline training approach.},

   meteorological information is seen as a potentially propitious means of
   adaptation to changing climate conditions. Forecasts of extreme weather
   events are especially valuable in resource-poor settings where
   climate-related vulnerability is high, such as for smallholder farmers
   in low-income countries. In this paper we provide estimates of frost
   warnings valuation in the context of small-scale quinoa production in
   the Peruvian Altiplano using a cross-disciplinary approach. We first
   present a detailed contextual assessment of quinoa production in the
   study region based on agrometeorological and socio-economic data that
   was obtained through a representative farm household survey conducted in
   December 2016. Building on this assessment, we propose a stochastic
   life-cycle model, replicating the lifetime cycle of a quinoa-producing
   household, in order to derive a theoretical valuation of frost warnings.
   Calibrating the model to our data we provide estimates of frost-warning
   valuation which are in the range of \$30-50 per household per year,
   depending on the forecast accuracy and agents' risk aversion. In a last
   step, using the observational data from the farm household survey, we
   show that access to existing meteorological services is empirically
   associated with avoided losses in agricultural production that amount to
   \$18 per average household and per year. Our findings point to high
   climate vulnerabilities of smallholders in the Peruvian Altiplano and
   potentially large welfare gains from incorporating improved
   meteorological services into their decision-making process. At the same
   time, we highlight that attention must also be paid to complementary
   non-meteorological interventions that bear the potential to leverage
   these welfare gains.},

Abstract = {Collaborative work processes from the perspective of Building
   Information Modeling demand technical and organizational information
   requirements from managers. In response, data schema Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) has been making significant entities and domain inclusions
   with a semantic level capable of supporting OpenBIM interoperability
   throughout the project lifecycle. This paper applies Design Science
   Research methodology to explore how the IFC should be specified so that
   BIM actors can meet the representation context of a project translating
   data through Inheritance Diagrams, which offer auxiliary contributions.
   The Protocol developed to address the research problem revealed that
   some information requirements had not been met, as the universe of
   optional data in the schema is broad. Therefore, an artifact is created
   to fully meet the demand and is validated by different software. This
   reveals that the insertion of data can be performed to meet the desired
   interoperability and stands a valuable tool for BIM actors.},

Title = {Factors for effective BIM governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {89-101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With increasing complexity of construction projects, a collaborative
   environment becomes essential to ensure effective communication during
   the project lifecycle. Conventional team collaboration raises issues
   such as the lack of trust; uncertainties regarding ownership and
   Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs); miscommunication; and cultural
   differences, among others. Additional issues can arise in relation to
   the generated data, including data loss, data inconsistency, errors, and
   liability for wrong or incomplete data. Furthermore, There is a shortage
   of studies that investigate collaboration practices, data management,
   and governance issues from a socio-technical perspective. This study
   investigates the development of a BIM governance framework (G-BIM) with
   support of Cloud technologies, identifying effectiveness factors that
   guarantee successful collaboration. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with informed BIM experts in the UK, with the aim of: (i)
   discovering current trends in Information Communication Technologies
   (ICT) and team collaboration during construction projects; (ii)
   exploring barriers to BIM adoption; (iii) exploring the role of
   BIM-related standards; (iv) consulting BIM experts to develop a
   Cloud-based BIM governance solution to tackle team collaboration on
   BIM-based projects; and (v) investigating the role of Cloud in
   supporting BIM governance research and development. The findings reveal
   several BIM adoption barriers and issues directly influencing team
   collaboration. The key findings led to the development of a BIM
   governance framework (G-BIM). The purpose of the G-BIM framework is to
   present and summarise effective factors resulting in successful
   governance and a collaborative BIM approach, to support the future
   development of a Cloud-based BIM governance platform. The G-BIM
   framework comprises three main components: (i) actors and team, (ii)
   data management and ICT, and (iii) processes and contracts. Furthermore,
   the study reveals the high potential of Cloud technologies to advance
   current BIM governance solutions, because of its performance
   capabilities, accessibility, storage, and scalability.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {37-47},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Huge progress has been made on `Augmented Reality' (AR) techniques such
   as registration, tracking, and display hardware. However, a construction
   AR system should be more convenient and combined with in-use
   applications to support multi-disciplinary users throughout construction
   lifecycle. This paper presents a video-based on-line AR environment and
   a pilot cloud framework. The contribution lies in two aspects: firstly,
   an environment utilizing web3D is demonstrated, in which on-site images
   are rendered to box nodes and registered with virtual objects through a
   three-step method; secondly, it is further extended to be ``cloud{''}
   through federation of BIM (building information modeling) and BSNS
   (business social networking services). Technical solutions to key issues
   such as authoring, publishing, and composition are designed. The
   proposed environment is seamlessly integrated into in-use information
   systems and therefore enjoys greater usability. Implementations
   demonstrate how this framework and environment work. Although
   preliminary, it is conclusive for proof of concept. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Der Begriff ,,Digitaler Zwilling{''} findet im deutschsprachigen Raum
   zunehmend Verwendung fur die digitale Verwaltung und uberwachung des
   Zustands von Brucken. Wahrend in der Industrie und Medizin bereits
   normative Entwicklungen fur den Einsatz Digitaler Zwillinge angestossen
   wurden, werden im Bauwesen derzeit erste Prototypen umgesetzt. Fur den
   Betrieb digitaler Abbilder wurden proprietare Onlineumgebungen
   entwickelt, die in ihrer Flexibilitat und Wiederverwendbarkeit
   beschrankt sind. Eine Skalierung mittels Einbindung in Modelle des
   Building Information Modellings wird untersucht, stosst jedoch aufgrund
   der Echtzeitanbindung an ihre Grenzen. Im Beitrag werden bestehende
   Definitionen des Digitalen Zwillings der Industrie in den Kontext des
   Bauwesens gesetzt. Anhand der in Teil 1 des Beitrags vorgestellten
   Isenbrucke in Schwindegg wird die Implementierung dieser Brucke als
   Industrie 4.0-Verwaltungsschale prasentiert. Es zeigt sich, dass auch
   fur Ingenieurbauwerke ein industrieller datengetriebener Digitaler
   Zwilling technisch und semantisch umgesetzt werden kann. Im Beitrag
   werden ausserdem zukunftige Herausforderungen fur die Entwicklung von
   Auswertungs- und Steuermechanismen fur das Bauwerk vorgestellt und eine

   Syntax fur die Kommunikation zwischen den Verwaltungsschalen.
   Digital twins for medium span bridges - pilot project bridge Schwindegg
   - part 2: Asset Administration ShellThe term ` digital twin ` is
   becoming increasingly popular in German-speaking countries for the
   digital management and condition monitoring of bridges. Although
   standardised developments for the use of digital twins have already been
   initiated in industry and medicine, the first prototypes are currently
   being implemented in the construction industry. The digital images are
   typically operated in online environments that are proprietary to the
   project and have limited reusability. The article investigates the
   integration of scaling into Building Information Modelling models, which
   is reaching its limits due to the real-time capability. It places
   existing definitions of the digital twin of the industry in the context
   of the construction industry. The implementation of the Isenbridge in
   Schwindegg as an Industry 4.0 Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is
   presented, building on Part 1 of this contribution. We show that an
   industrial, data-driven digital twin can also be implemented technically
   and semantically for engineering structures. The article also presents
   the future challenges for evaluation and control mechanisms still to be
   developed for the structure. We also show a possible visualisation. The
   goal is to develop a syntax for the AAS' communication.},

Title = {Functional Profiling and Evolutionary Analysis of a Marine Microalgal
   Virus Pangenome},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Phycodnaviridae are large double-stranded DNA viruses, which facilitate
   studies of host-virus interactions and co-evolution due to their
   prominence in algal infection and their role in the life cycle of algal
   blooms. However, the genomic interpretation of these viruses is hampered
   by a lack of functional information, stemming from the surprising number
   of hypothetical genes of unknown function. It is also unclear how many
   of these genes are widely shared within the clade. Using one of the most
   extensively characterized genera, Coccolithovirus, as a case study, we
   combined pangenome analysis, multiple functional annotation tools,
   AlphaFold structural modeling, and literature analysis to compare the
   core and accessory pangenome and assess support for novel functional
   predictions. We determined that the Coccolithovirus pangenome shares
   30\% of its genes with all 14 strains, making up the core. Notably, 34\%
   of its genes were found in at most three strains. Core genes were
   enriched in early expression based on a transcriptomic dataset of
   Coccolithovirus EhV-201 algal infection, were more likely to be similar
   to host proteins than the non-core set, and were more likely to be
   involved in vital functions such as replication, recombination, and
   repair. In addition, we generated and collated annotations for the EhV
   representative EhV-86 from 12 different annotation sources, building up
   information for 142 previously hypothetical and putative membrane
   proteins. AlphaFold was further able to predict structures for 204
   EhV-86 proteins with a modelling accuracy of good-high. These functional
   clues, combined with generated AlphaFold structures, provide a
   foundational framework for the future characterization of this model
   genus (and other giant viruses) and a further look into the evolution of
   the Coccolithovirus proteome.},

Title = {Nestboxes and immigration drive the growth of an urban Peregrine Falcon
   <i>Falco peregrinus</i> population},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {156},

Abstract = {Drivers of wildlife population dynamics are generally numerous and
   interacting. Some of these drivers may impact demographic processes that
   are difficult to estimate, such as immigration into the focal
   population. Populations may furthermore be small and subject to
   demographic stochasticity. All of these factors contribute to blur the
   causal relationship between past management action and current
   population trends. The urban Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus
   population in Cape Town, South Africa, increased from three pairs in
   1997 to 18 pairs in 2010. Nestboxes were installed over this period to
   manage the interface between new urban pairs of Falcons and the human
   users of colonized buildings, and incidentally to improve breeding
   success. We used integrated population models (IPMs) formally to combine
   information from a capture-mark-recapture study, monitoring of
   reproductive success and counts of population size. As all local
   demographic processes were directly observed, the IPM approach also
   allowed us to estimate immigration by difference. The provision of
   nestboxes, as a possible stimulant of population growth, improved
   breeding success and accounted for an estimated 3-26\% of the population
   increase. The most important driver of growth, however, was immigration.
   Despite low sample sizes, the IPM approach allowed us to obtain
   relatively precise estimates of the population-level impact of nestbox
   deployment. The goal of conservation interventions is often to increase
   population size, so the effectiveness of such interventions should
   ideally be assessed at the population level. IPMs are powerful tools in
   this context for combining demographic information that may be limited
   due to small population size or practical constraints on monitoring. Our
   study quantitatively documented both the immigration process that led to
   growth of a small population and the effect of a management action that
   helped the process.},

Title = {What Influences Home Gardeners' Food Waste Composting Intention in
   High-Rise Buildings in Dhaka Megacity, Bangladesh? An Integrated Model
   of TPB and DMP},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Composting is a sustainable way of transforming organic waste into
   valuable organic fertilizers which have the potential to act as soil
   conditioners by controlling various biological processes. The prime
   objective of the current study was to determine the influencing factors
   behind the intent of home food waste composting, by employing the
   combined model of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Dualistic Passion
   Model (DMP). The combined model showed a higher predictive ability in
   comparison to the individual TPB model. The fit statistic of the
   integrated model was deemed good, and 65\% of the variance for home
   composting intention was explained. Using a face-to-face questionnaire
   survey, a total of 203 valid responses were gathered from home gardeners
   and tested via a unique two-step methodology: the PLS-SEM and the
   artificial neural network (ANN). The results revealed that the
   composting intention can be significantly influenced by attitude,
   subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The study also
   confirmed the positive effect of harmonious passion and the negative
   effect of obsessive passion on the intention of food waste composting.
   Furthermore, the hybrid method produced more reliable results because HP
   was found to be the most important variable in both ANN and PLS-SEM
   results, while PBC was observed to be the second most important variable
   in ANN and the fourth most important in PLS-SEM. The results of the
   current study not only highlight the importance of passion in
   determining food waste composting intention in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but
   also provide helpful information for designing effective, sustainable
   tactics for encouraging residents to compost food waste at home.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 9 on building resilient
   infrastructure highlights the urgent need for enabling evidence-based
   decision making for Infrastructure Asset Management supported by
   targeted platforms such as digital engineering and digital earth. In
   this paper the authors argue that an Asset Information Requirement
   matrix is an essential decision support tool for authorities and
   practitioners to evaluate right time, right place use of infrastructure
   data for resilient outcomes. The authors present an exploratory study
   that synthesizes the experiences of senior asset management
   decision-makers from road research institutes, state and local
   government bodies based in South East Queensland, Australia. The
   findings are discussed in relation to: digital engineering for managing
   complex data; current practice and outlook; key asset information
   requirements; and data structures, interactions and interdependencies.
   The authors present an `Asset Information Requirement Matrix' that
   categorises 66 data requirements across four key infrastructure data
   types (including 13 information categories), and asserts the relevance
   of these data requirements for the six key phases of planning, design,
   construction, acquisition, operations and end-of-life treatment. The
   authors also present an `Asset Interaction Matrix' which depicts the
   temporal, spatial and logical relationships between the 13 information
   categories. The authors conclude the importance of these asset matrices
   to leverage digital engineering for resilience infrastructure outcomes.
   The two matrices create a common language platform for engaging in
   digital engineering conversations, wherein authorities and practitioners
   can establish clear arrangements for measuring and monitoring road
   infrastructure through its life cycle.},

Title = {Structuring a Comprehensive Carbon-Emission Framework for the Whole
   Lifecycle of Building, Operation, and Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The construction industry is responsible for more than 40\% of the
   carbon emissions in the United States. These emissions are generated by
   energy, water, and materials consumed at different stages of the
   construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal processes and during
   the recycling and reusing of construction components as materials or
   biomass. Carbon-emission modeling is a complex procedure of process and
   footprint integration for different components either directly and
   indirectly associated with a service, product, material, or system at
   different phases. Prior research focused on each phase separately and/or
   supplemental information from alternative sources because of the lack of
   available data and information. Even though there are comprehensive
   lifecycle models covering every phase of a project, these models do not
   integrate existing models. The purpose of this study was to develop a
   comprehensive framework of building lifecycle carbon-emission modeling
   that would integrate existing models, information, and data. This
   research integrated prior models and methods, incorporated multitier
   mechanisms, and developed flexibility within the model so that
   reliability would be improved for measuring, tracking, and quantifying
   carbon-and environmental-related features, factors, and variables. This
   paper discusses the first phase of the research, model development, and
   testing. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Overview: the opportunity of BIM in railway},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {103-116},
Abstract = {Purpose - The authors will give an overview of the railway market, with
   a focus on Morocco, before seeing the challenges to face, before listing
   some benefits of rail links in terms of development, ecology, security,
   space management, etc. The authors will then give an overview of the
   development of BIM, its benefits, risks and issues. The purpose of this
   paper is to verify that the BIM can provide the railway with the tools
   to face some of its challenges and improve its productivity.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is part of our research project
   on the integration of BIM in railway, which is the result of a
   partnership between Colas Rail Maroc and the ENSAK of the Ibn Tofail
   University of Kenitra. The objective of this paper is mainly to confirm
   that the integration of BIM with the railway, through a theoretical and
   practical study, can have positive impacts. To do this, our methodology
   consists in studying briefly the development of the railway, the need to
   improve the budgets and schedules of the projects, to increase the
   productivity, before showing the advantages of the BIM in the sector of
   the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). The study of
   feedback from railway projects (chosen for their date of completion
   -beyond 2014, their size, their geographical situation in several
   countries and for the availability of literature in a new field) will
   confirm the initial hypotheses. Among the projects studied will be a
   project that has been the subject of an article written by the authors
   of this paper. In the discussion of the results, the authors will focus
   on the benefits, risks and limitations of integrating BIMinto the
   railway. In conclusion, the authors are laying the groundwork for future
   research in the field.
   Findings -The cases study discussed in this paper and previous research
   confirms the hypotheses of the literature. The integration of BIM into
   railway projects can have several advantages: collaboration, time
   saving, cost optimization, prevention of conflicts between networks,
   construction before construction, optimization of facility management,
   improvement of the quality of works, prefabrication. They also allowed
   us to illustrate the risks (status and appropriation of the BIM model,
   lack of standardization of versions or software and lack of
   understanding of the basics of schedules and specifications) and
   limitations (lack of feedback, lack of adaptability and convergence of
   tools). These experiences have also shown that the use of BIM is not
   just a technological transition, but a revolution in the project
   management process, which requires several key success factors
   (participation of all, commitment, change management and adoption of the
   collaborative approach). Visualization, collaboration and conflict
   elimination are the three main chapters where the benefits of BIM can be
   organized. In fact, there is a lot of intersection between these
   chapters, but they have been chosen as the main ideas around which all
   the benefits can be better understood. Visualization primarily addresses
   the benefits to an individual and improving one's personal understanding
   as a result of using BIM. The collaboration refers to the cooperative
   action of several team members, which is encouraged and facilitated by
   BIM. Conflict elimination mainly concerns project-related benefits, such
   as conflict reduction, waste, risks, costs and time. For railway
   infrastructure projects, the main purpose of using BIM is to improve the
   design integration process, internal project team communication and
   collision detection to eliminate risk of rehabilitation.
   Research limitations/implications - The application of the BIM process
   in railway infrastructure requires constant improvement. This concerns
   the development of libraries and the models available to all users in
   order to encourage the development of this methodology and,
   consequently, its use of information throughout the life cycle of an
   infrastructure work.
   Practical implications -The case study of real projects incorporating
   BIM confirms the results of the literature review. The benefits of
   integrating BIM into rail projects are multiple and proven: cost
   control, decision support, avoids extra work due to design errors,
   improves detection of interface problems, improves planning of vision,
   help with prefabrication and facility management, etc. Finally, the BIM
   process is able to overcome delays in procedures slowing the development
   of the construction industry in many countries, especially in Morocco,
   because of the slowness of design (or downright bad design).
   Social implications - The integration of BIM into rail is becoming a
   global trend. This integration requires government decisions and a
   maturation of technology and tools. The authorities of some developed
   countries studied (Sweden, UK, France, Germany) in the railways, at
   different stages of implementation, are adopting BIM in the process of
   setting up new railway projects. This political impulse is still behind
   in southern countries, such as Morocco. The trend and the data collected
   indicate an adoption between 2020 and 2030 of BIM in all/some AEC
   projects in developed countries. This will have an impact on other
   countries that will soon be doing the same, especially in the railway
   sector to adopt the BIM.
   Originality/value - As part of the realization of this paper, we
   proceeded to the implementation of an electrical substation as part of
   the project to build 40 electric traction substations built by Colas
   Rail on behalf of ONCF.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been experiencing high waves of
   revolutionised innovative technologies globally. These resulted from the
   highly innovative demands of the 4th industrial revolution (IR), which
   does not exclude the construction industry. These technologies do not
   rely on traditional design and build principles, and they require
   sophisticated skills and competencies. Currently, the construction
   industry is still struggling to find professionals with innovative
   competencies and the skills needed to manage the building lifecycle
   process. These have been a major concern in developing countries'
   construction industry sector. Employers in the construction industry are
   now looking for construction management graduates (CMG) who are
   academically qualified and also possess considerable
   construction-related innovative skills and competencies in related
   technological software or tools. This study investigates the expected
   core skills and competence required by CMG. The methodology entails a
   well-structured systematic literature review, wherein 13 expected core
   competencies and 27 expected core skills were identified. Based on
   these, primary data were elicited through an online Google Forms survey
   distributed to professionals in the Nigerian construction industry. A
   total of 330 valid responses were obtained. Relative Important Index
   (RII) and principal component analysis (PCA) were carried out and
   presented. The result reveals the industry's expectations and provides
   guidance to CMG seeking employment in the construction industry.
   Understanding the industry expectations and possessing the required core
   competencies will enable the CMG to remain relevant in the dynamic built
   environments. This study contributes to building information modelling
   (BIM) knowledge and the current innovative competencies and skills
   required in the built environment.},

Abstract = {Data driven technologies are revolutionising the engineering sector by
   providing new ways of performing day to day tasks through the life cycle
   of a product as it progresses through manufacture, to build,
   qualification test, field operation and maintenance. Significant
   increase in data transfer speeds combined with cost effective data
   storage, and ever-increasing computational power provide the building
   blocks that enable companies to adopt data driven technologies such as
   data analytics, IOT and machine learning. Improved business operational
   efficiency and more responsive customer support provide the incentives
   for business investment. Digital twins, that leverages these
   technologies in their various forms to converge physics and data driven
   models, are therefore being widely adopted.
   A high-fidelity multi-physics digital twin, HFDT, that digitally
   replicates a gas turbine as it is built based on part and build data
   using advanced component and assembly models is introduced. The HFDT,
   among other benefits enables data driven assessments to be carried out
   during manufacture and assembly for each turbine allowing these
   processes to be optimised and the impact of variability or process
   change to be readily evaluated. On delivery of the turbine and its
   associated HFDT to the service support team the HFDT supports the
   evaluation of in-service performance deteriorations, the impact of field
   interventions and repair and the changes in operating characteristics
   resulting from overhaul and turbine upgrade. Thus, creating a cradle to
   grave physics and data driven twin of the gas turbine asset.
   In this paper, one branch of HFDT using a power turbine module is
   firstly presented. This involves simultaneous modelling of gas path and
   solid using high fidelity CFD and FEA which converts the cold geometry
   to hot running conditions to assess the impact of various manufacturing
   and build variabilities. It is shown this process can be executed within
   reasonable time frames enabling creation of HFDT for each turbine during
   manufacture and assembly and for this to be transferred to the service
   team for deployment during field operations.
   Following this, it is shown how data driven technologies are used in
   conjunction with the HFDT to improve predictions of engine performance
   from early build information. The example shown, shows how a higher
   degree of confidence is achieved through the development of an
   artificial neural network of the compressor tip gap feature and its
   effect on overall compressor efficiency.},

Abstract = {This paper is a study model of native architecture by educational and
   practical approach. In the case study of this research, Qashqai tribe
   housing in southern Iran, as one example of a sustainable native culture
   has been studied. The aim of this research is educational uses for
   architecture audiences that they could be introduced with concepts such
   as natural environment, built environment and influences of life cycle
   on architecture. Another objective aim is providing a basic practical
   model for housing pattern design for sedentary nomads. The qualtative
   research method has been chosen because of geographic distribution of
   tribes and the nature of the subject. The instruments used in this study
   are library and detailed field studies include observation and
   information record, taking pictures, maps, architectural drawings and
   In-depth interviews. Also, examples of black-tent Qashqai complexes have
   been studied for the field data. After the library and field studies,
   the required analysis has been taken that includes; the analysis of the
   human encounter to the natural environment and built environment and how
   human behave in space and time. The main finding of this study is
   providing a study model of native architecture. Second, is presenting
   the human settlement pattern that derived from the encounter of human
   and natural environment. In this pattern, issues such as; separation of
   human and animal spaces, multipurpose use of space, human behaviors in
   space - time, Simplification and sustainability of architecture in
   various dimensions has been described. In this study, we have tried by
   consideration to the tips of nomadic life draw the attention of the
   architecture audiences in educational district to the main regards of
   human in building environment. Findings of this research in the
   practical field could be applied for housing patterns design of
   sedentary tribes by public sector. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for BIM-Based Site Safety Practice},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With developments in Industry 4.0, there is growing momentum to adopt
   technology-assisted tools to support existing processes. Even though
   most construction processes are now computerized, safety procedures have
   not yet fully embraced the digital revolution. Building information
   modeling (BIM) is a platform that radically redefines the way in which
   businesses operate. Various past studies on the application of BIM in
   site safety mainly focus on using BIM for safety during construction and
   for a specific project type. The potential benefits of BIM for site
   safety have not yet been fully explored. The aim of the present study is
   to develop a BIM-based automatic safety checking (ASC) framework for an
   early identification of hazards. It includes safety checking with
   codified OSHA rules, corrective actions, scheduling, and reporting in a
   virtual environment. All these steps are part of the risk lifecycle
   which is typically managed according to the phases of construction on a
   physical site. However, in the proposed framework, all these steps are
   managed at the preconstruction stage in a virtual environment. The major
   contribution of this study is the proposed framework that provides the
   conceptual foundation for early site safety management by identifying
   hazards at the design stage. The integration of a 3D model with codified
   OSHA standard safety rules ensures that the design is in adherence to
   safety rules and is rendered hazard-free for a pilot case.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity and resiliency of wide-area monitoring, protection, and
   control (WAMPAC) applications is critically important to ensure secure,
   reliable, and economical operation of the bulk power system. WAMPAC
   relies heavily on the security of measurements and control commands
   transmitted over wide-area communication networks for real-time
   operational, protection, and control functions. The current ``N-1{''}
   security criterion for grid operation is inadequate to address malicious
   cyber events; therefore, it is important to fundamentally redesign
   WAMPAC and to enhance energy management system applications to make them
   attack resilient. In this paper, we present three key contributions to
   enhance the cybersecurity and resiliency of WAMPAC. First, we describe
   an end-to-end attack-resilient cyber physical security framework for
   WAMPAC applications encompassing the entire security life cycle
   including risk assessment, attack prevention, attack detection, attack
   mitigation, and attack resilience. Second, we describe a
   defense-in-depth architecture that incorporates attack resilience at
   both the infrastructure layer and the application layer by leveraging
   domain-specific security approaches at the WAMPAC application layer in
   addition to traditional cybersecurity measures at the information
   technology infrastructure layer. Third, we discuss several
   attack-resilient algorithms for WAMPAC that leverage measurement design
   and cyber physical system model-based anomaly detection and mitigation
   along with illustrative case studies. We believe that the research
   issues and solutions identified in this paper will open up several
   avenues for research in this area. In particular, the proposed
   framework, architectural concepts, and attack-resilient algorithms would
   serve as essential building blocks to transform the
   ``fault-resilient{''} grid of today into an ``attackre-silient{''} grid
   of the future.},

Title = {BIM for Smart Hospital Management during COVID-19 Using MCDM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, smart hospitals'
   contributions to pre-medical, remote diagnosis, and social distancing
   has been further vetted. Smart hospital management evolves with new
   technology and knowledge management, which needs an evaluation system to
   prioritize its associated criteria and sub-criteria. The global effect
   of the COVID-19 pandemic further necessitates a comprehensive research
   of smart hospital management. This paper will utilize Analytical
   Hierarchy Process (AHP) within Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)
   to establish a smart hospital evaluation system with evaluation criteria
   and sub-criteria, which were then further prioritized and mapped to
   BIM-related alternatives to inform asset information management (AIM)
   practices. This context of this study included the expert opinions of
   six professionals in the smart hospital field and collected 113
   responses from hospital-related personnel. The results indicated that
   functionalities connected to end users are critical, in particular IoT's
   Network Core Functionalities, AI's Deep Learning and CPS's Special
   Network Technologies. Furthermore, BIM's capability to contribute to the
   lifecycle management of assets can relate and contribute to the
   asset-intensive physical criteria of smart hospitals, in particular IoT,
   service technology innovations and their sub-criteria.},

Title = {Using 3D CityGML for the Modeling of the Food Waste and Wastewater
   Generation-A Case Study for the City of Montreal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {The paper explains a workflow to simulate the food energy water (FEW)
   nexus for an urban district combining various data sources like 3D city
   models, particularly the City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) data
   model from the Open Geospatial Consortium, Open StreetMap and Census
   data. A long term vision is to extend the CityGML data model by
   developing a FEW Application Domain Extension (FEW ADE) to support
   future FEW simulation workflows such as the one explained in this paper.
   Together with the mentioned simulation workflow, this paper also
   identifies some necessary FEW related parameters for the future
   development of a FEW ADE. Furthermore, relevant key performance
   indicators are investigated, and the relevant datasets necessary to
   calculate these indicators are studied. Finally, different calculations
   are performed for the downtown borough Ville-Marie in the city of
   Montreal (Canada) for the domains of food waste (FW) and wastewater (WW)
   generation. For this study, a workflow is developed to calculate the
   energy generation from anaerobic digestion of FW and WW. In the first
   step, the data collection and preparation was done. Here relevant data
   for georeferencing, data for model set-up, and data for creating the
   required usage libraries, like food waste and wastewater generation per
   person, were collected. The next step was the data integration and
   calculation of the relevant parameters, and lastly, the results were
   visualized for analysis purposes. As a use case to support such
   calculations, the CityGML level of detail two model of Montreal is
   enriched with information such as building functions and building usages
   from OpenStreetMap. The calculation of the total residents based on the
   CityGML model as the main input for Ville-Marie results in a population
   of 72,606. The statistical value for 2016 was 89,170, which corresponds
   to a deviation of 15.3\%. The energy recovery potential of FW is about
   24,024 GJ/year, and that of wastewater is about 1,629 GJ/year, adding up
   to 25,653 GJ/year. Relating values to the calculated number of
   inhabitants in Ville-Marie results in 330.9 kWh/year for FW and 22.4
   kWh/year for wastewater, respectively.},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the continuous development of urbanisation, the
   proportion of interior design in public buildings has been increasing
   year by year. At the same time, there is a tendency in many places for
   the interior spaces of public buildings to be upscale and retro. This
   indicates that people are paying more and more attention to the
   spiritual aspect of their lives, in addition to the materialistic
   pursuit of enjoyment. The current phenomenon of overdecoration in
   society can lead to excessive luxury and wastefulness. In these wasteful
   interiors, the beauty of the building itself is lost. In addition, this
   type of interior design is not only expensive but also poses certain
   safety risks to some extent. In the modern society, public buildings are
   essential places for public activities. To be specific, they are closely
   linked to public services and social management attributes. As a result,
   public buildings usually play a decisive role in facilitating
   communication and cooperation between various persons. Thus, the
   construction requirements of public buildings are currently increasing
   and the structural shapes of buildings are becoming more complex. In
   addition, the level of technology and the use of public buildings are
   becoming increasingly demanding. As a result, it is quite important to
   examine how modern and emerging technologies can be applied to public
   building design in order to improve its effectiveness. At the same time,
   with the continuous and rapid development of China's economy and the
   promotion of the concept of environmental protection, the greening of
   public buildings has become an object of concern and research. There are
   many different types of existing public buildings in China, and in the
   design process, the energy consumption of the building throughout its
   life cycle and its impact on the surrounding environment are not fully
   considered, resulting in problems such as high energy consumption and
   poor indoor comfort in the actual use of the building. However, the
   demolition and reconstruction of buildings can lead to waste of
   resources and environmental pollution. Therefore, it is feasible and
   necessary to study the application of green building technologies in the
   design of public buildings. This study models the effectiveness of
   public building interior design based on BIM technology from the
   perspective of integrated design as well as parametric design. This
   model enables the interior design of public buildings to become energy
   efficient, emission reducing, and environmentally sustainable. After
   all, the integration of architecture and interior design can reduce
   unnecessary decorative waste. In addition, this model can also respond
   to the government's efforts to develop an ecological civilisation,
   creating a new way of living that is resource efficient.},

Title = {Innovation in complex assembled electronic products: An analysis of the

Abstract = {A complex assembled electronic product (CAEP), such as a modern
   television (TV), can be produced in a variety of design configurations
   using different combinations of software and hardware components that
   are arranged together in a hierarchy of technical subsystems within a
   defined product architecture. We examine the lifecycle of individual
   components that make up a CAEP to better understand why its dominant
   design configuration includes specific components from among the (often
   many) competing alternatives. The emergence of the dominant design
   configuration of a product has long-term implications on the operational
   efficiency of a firm's product assembly line and its component selection
   strategy. We test hypotheses that explain both the inclusion of a
   component in the dominant design configuration of a CAEP, and its
   longevity to remain in the product market over the lifecycle of the CAEP
   using three key factors: (a) pleiotropy, or the number of functions
   supported by the component, (b) the nature of standards used by the
   component (open vs. closed), and (c) the source of innovation of the
   component (exogenous vs. endogenous to the industry). We empirically
   test our hypotheses using a longitudinal data set of 2830 TV models
   spanning 15 years (2002-2016). The results show that components that
   have higher pleiotropy and that are supported by open standards not only
   have a higher chance of being selected into the dominant design
   configuration of TV, but also remain in the TV market for a longer time.
   Specifically, every additional functionality associated with a component
   increases its likelihood of entering the dominant design configuration
   by approximately three times, and its longevity by about 2 years.
   Similarly, a component supported by an open standard is approximately
   four times more likely to be part of the dominant design configuration
   compared with a component supported by a closed standard, and it remains
   in the TV market for approximately an additional 2 years. In addition,
   components developed through endogenous innovation efforts were nearly
   five times more likely to enter the dominant design configuration of TV.
   Their longevity, however, was not significantly different from that of
   components sourced exogenously. Building on these results, we discuss
   the implications for product management of CAEP and for further research
   to examine innovation in CAEPs.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to characterize the feelings of
   belonging or alienation and social emotional perceptions of immigrant
   youths in an age when there are well-developed digital environments
   granting availability without barriers of time and place. This research
   is a mixed-method study with emphasis on quantitative research. A total
   of 559 Israeli adolescents aged 12 to 18 participated in the study, of
   whom 222 (40\%) were immigrants residing for up to four years in the
   country. To characterize the absorption process experienced by the
   immigrant youths, we used the life cycle assessment (LCA) mechanism. We
   identified a 2-class model. The first group, 36\% of the immigrant
   youths who participated in the study, was characterized by a positive
   feeling regarding their experience of the absorption process. Time in
   the country of absorption (under two years and from two years to four
   years) did not change their approach to the process they experienced.
   Immigrant adolescents feel that thanks to the mobile technologies, the
   translations, databases, numerous applications, and groups on the social
   networks, they are able to face the challenges and difficulties they
   encounter in the process of absorption in the new country. We found that
   the positive process of identity building by immigrant youths in the
   digital age is a combination of interactions with those who remain in
   the country of origin and significant interactions in the new society,
   especially in schools, fostering a sense of belonging, sharing,
   acceptance, a sense of being needed, and attention, which are likely to
   create a sense of resilience in immigrant youths.},

Title = {Embedding Procedural Knowledge into Building Information Models: The IFC
   Procedural Language and Its Application for Flexible Transition Curve
   Representation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) refers to the continuous use of
   semantically rich three-dimensional (3D) building models throughout the
   entire lifecycle of a facility. BIM data models capture the geometry as
   well as the semantics of buildings and its constituent parts in an
   object-oriented manner. They have been developed to achieve high-quality
   data exchange between software applications, reduce data loss, and
   increase interoperability. Across the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry, the open-data model industry foundation
   classes (IFC) has become a well-accepted standard. The main contribution
   of this paper is the introduction of a procedural language called the
   IFC procedural language (IFCPL) that can be easily embedded into an
   IFC-based building information model. This enables software developers
   to exchange procedural programs between different software applications
   in a platform-independent way using a neutral data format. IFCPL
   programs describe algorithms that operate on a set of input parameters
   and generate a set of output parameters (return values). The EXPRESS
   language, which is part of standard for the exchange of product model
   data (STEP), provides the concept of functions and rules for
   representing algorithmic knowledge. However, EXPRESS operates on the
   schema level, i.e., the rules and algorithms defined apply to all
   instances of the respective entity type in the same manner. IFCPL shifts
   this concept from the schema (class level) to the instance level and is
   not limited to realizing data integrity or attribute derivation. The
   paper describes in detail the features and the design of the IFCPL
   language. To illustrate its applicability, the language is used to
   demonstrate how transition curves of road or railway alignments can be
   described in a very flexible manner: IFCPL allows the definition and
   exchange of algorithms for computing the curve coordinates from general
   curve parameters. In doing so, software developers can dynamically
   define and exchange new transition curve types without modifying the IFC
   data model. At the same time, this approach helps avoid
   misinterpretations of informal curve descriptions. The procedural
   language provides a powerful option for adding enhancements and reduces
   software development costs by allowing semiautomated integration.
   Besides the alignment use case, there are many other application areas
   in which IFCPL can be used and where software developers as well as
   software users can benefit from it. They are discussed extensively
   throughout the paper.},

Abstract = {Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are responsible for managing and
   maintaining transportation assets in the US. DOTs manage a wide variety
   of assets throughout their lifecycle, including high-value assets such
   as pavements and bridges, in addition to a wide variety of ancillary
   assets. Managing transportation assets with declining funding and
   deteriorating infrastructure conditions requires that DOTs have reliable
   and useful quality data to make better decision-making and efficient
   capital investments. However, they are still facing challenges in
   collecting, managing, and sharing transportation asset data. By
   conducting a comprehensive review of the DOTs' current practices in
   managing their transportation asset data, used technologies to assist in
   managing asset data, challenges faced, and addressed efforts to pass
   those challenges were extracted and grouped into six major data
   management practices. Furthermore, this paper investigated the
   possibility of implementing Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a hub

Abstract = {This research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the current
   ecosystem of BIM technology and its utilization in the UAE. Since the
   UAE has been an early adopter of BIM, its utilization of BIM is now
   likely to reach that of developed nations. By adopting the BIM case
   study analysis framework, two sets of projects of similar categories in
   terms of functionality and typology were selected and mapped. One set
   represents projects within the UAE, and the second represents projects
   from developed nations utilizing BIM during the projects' lifecycle
   (LC). Incorporating expert interviews to triangulate the results
   collected from the case study analysis will further contribute to
   developing a more in-depth comprehension of BIM use in the UAE. The
   three significant inferences can be drawn from the findings. Firstly, in
   the UAE, stakeholders utilize BIM fragmentarily in different stages.
   Secondly, the full extent of BIM utilization over the project's LC is
   not pursued. Thirdly, no effective BIM standards or protocols exist.
   Even though international firms are the main drivers of UAE BIM adoption
   and utilization, UAE BIM is still in its infancy, necessitating a more
   collaborative effort to realize the holistic benefits of the BIM
   process. The findings could be utilized to identify industry standards
   and guiding principles for BIM implementation in the UAE and help
   identify areas for improvement. It also provides valuable insights into
   how BIM can be used more effectively in the country and how its use can
   be promoted. Additionally, it could be used as a guide for owners/asset
   managers and AEC professionals in the UAE looking to implement BIM in
   their projects.},

Title = {Concept, Creation, Services and Future Directions of Digital Twins in
   the Construction Industry: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 23},
Abstract = {Currently, the engineering problems encountered in digital
   transformation of the construction industry are very complicated and
   need to be solved by integrating multiple technologies. Consequently,
   the concept of digital twin (DT) was introduced and quickly applied
   throughout the building lifecycle. Despite this, many practitioners lack
   understanding of DT in the construction industry (DT-CI) and its
   implementation. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a
   comprehensive and detailed review of DT-CI through a systematic
   literature review (SLR) that incorporates both quantitative and
   qualitative analysis. In this study, 222 DT-CI studies were selected
   from a pool of 2619 publications across multiple databases, and 43
   related researches were supplemented by the backward snowballing method
   based on co-citation analysis to generate the final bibliographic
   database. This paper quantitatively analyzes the current state,
   hotspots, and development trends of DT-CI research through a
   bibliometric review, and systematically clarifies the concept, creation,
   services, and future directions of DT-CI through a framework-based
   review. Finally, based on the SLR outcomes, this paper offers
   recommendations for future work and DT-CI implementation. Contrary to
   other reviews within this field, this paper adheres to a rigorous SLR
   protocol to ensure the reproducibility of review results. Moreover, by
   comparing construction and non-construction DT concepts, we highlight
   the unique characteristics of DT-CI, namely its association with
   building information modeling (BIM) and emphasis on geometric
   reconstruction of building entities.},

Title = {Extending the IFC Standard to Enable Road Operation and Maintenance
   Management through OpenBIM},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Open Building Information Modelling (OpenBIM) is a collaborative project
   management process. Its application to road infrastructures is currently
   limited. OpenBIM standards for infrastructure are still under
   development. One of these standards is the Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFC), which is a data architecture for modelling infrastructure
   projects. The current and upcoming releases of IFCRoad focus on
   structuring data for the design and construction phases of an
   infrastructure's lifecycle. Semantics of the O\&M process phase are not
   fully integrated within these standards. This paper proposes an
   extension of the IFC schema to enrich this standard with semantics
   inherent in the O\&M phase of road infrastructures. This extension,
   based on IFCInfra4OM ontology, allows the OpenBIM process to be fully
   applied to road infrastructures. Its implementation on a case study
   relative to the A7 Agadir-Marrakech Highway in Morocco enables, on the
   one hand, analysis and compliance with O\&M management requirements on
   the basis of a single container: the IFC-BIM-based model. On the other
   hand, it allows comparison of the OpenBIM process with that of ClosedBIM
   for the integration of O\&M data into BIM for a road infrastructure.},

Abstract = {This research examines how Holistic Building Design (HBD) affects
   Lifecycle Management of Building Structures in the ever-changing
   construction market. HBD includes adaptability, environmental
   sustainability, maintenance, and disaster preparation. It is a key idea
   in the present boom in resilient and sustainable building techniques. A
   surprising dearth of quantitative empirical research on HBD's impact on
   LMBS considering the field's growing importance. This study uses a
   quantitative method to explore the relationship between essential HBD
   components and LMBS outcomes especially Extended Service Life (ESL) and
   Optimized Performance and Value (OPV) are critical factors to address
   this information gap. The quantitative study polled 171 construction
   industry professionals and utilized Structural Equation Modelling to
   examine the data. This approach was selected for its ability to explore
   complex relationships between variables and constructs. HBD components
   Adaptability and Retrofitting (AAR), Environmental Considerations and
   Sustainability (ECS), Maintenance and Inspection Programs (MIP), and
   Resilience and Disaster Preparedness (RDP) profoundly influenced the
   Enhanced Service Life (ESL) and Optimized Performance and Value (OPV)
   elements of LMBS. Building adaptation and retrofitting, maintenance and
   inspection programs, and other activities increased building value and
   lifespan. These findings have major theoretical and practical
   implications. The work potentially fills a research gap by providing
   actual evidence on HBD-LMBS linkages. Practically, the results advise
   construction industry specialists to use HBD ideas for sustainable
   building management. Finally, our work illuminates the vital roles of
   HBD components in LMBS and paves the way for ecologically friendly
   building approaches.},

Title = {EVALUATING THE USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY FOR MAINTAINABILITY-FOCUSED DESIGN
   REVIEWS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {253-272},
Abstract = {The Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase can account for as much as
   80\% of the overall lifecycle cost of a project. The inputs from O\&M
   practitioners are often not incorporated during the design phase leading
   to maintainability issues during the O\&M phase, which results in
   significant costs and hinders building performance. Traditionally,
   design communication with practitioners is conducted using 2D drawings
   and in some more advanced projects, with Building Information Models
   (BIMs). Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to facilitate
   maintainability-focused design input from O\&M practitioners, but this
   application has not been studied in detail. This paper addresses the gap
   by examining the usability of VR for providing access-related
   maintainability inputs. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted to
   evaluate the difference in access-related inputs provided by sixteen
   O\&M practitioners, once using 2D drawings and BIM and again using VR.
   We assessed the variation in time for O\&M practitioners to provide the
   inputs and the perceived quality of the inputs using the two design
   communication methods. We also examined the effect of practitioners'
   years of experience on providing access-related maintainability inputs
   using VR. The results suggest that there was no statistically
   significant difference in the access-related maintainability inputs
   provided using the two design communication methods, which demonstrates
   that O\&M practitioners could provide similar access-related inputs
   using VR and traditional means of communication using 2D drawings and 3D
   models. The results also show that O\&M practitioners were able to
   provide inputs significantly faster using VR. The O\&M practitioners
   also reported that VR facilitated ease of use and high confidence in
   their inputs. Furthermore, the practitioners' years of experience did
   not lead to any variation in the access-related inputs provided and the
   time efficiency of providing the inputs. While the small sample size
   limits the generalizability of the results, the study acts as a proof of
   concept on the usability of VR for improving O\&M practitioner input on
   the maintainability of building designs.},

Title = {Construction process innovation on Brock Commons Tallwood House},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to present the construction process
   innovations that enabled the successful delivery of the hybrid mass
   timber high-rise building in Canada, the Brock Commons Tallwood House at
   the University of British Columbia. It is one of a set of papers
   examining the project, including companion papers that describe
   innovations in the mass timber design process and the impact of these
   innovations on construction performance. The focus of this paper is on
   innovation in the construction phase and its relationship to innovations
   implemented in previous project phases.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mixed-method, longitudinal case study approach was used in this
   research project to investigate and document the Tallwood House project
   over a three-year period. Both quantitative and qualitative data
   collection and analysis techniques were used. Members of the research
   team observed prefabrication and construction, conducted periodic
   interviews and reviewed project artefacts.
   Findings
   The research identified three innovation ``clusters,{''} including the
   use of innovative tools, techniques and strategies in the design and
   construction processes and the role they played in delivering the
   project. The ``clusters{''} were further characterized according to the
   type of ``connectivity{''} they afforded, either facilitation,
   operationalization or materialization. These two perspectives support a
   compounding view on innovation and help to understand how it can flow
   throughout a project's life cycle and across its supply chain. Three
   process-based innovations were initiated during the design phase,
   integrated design process, building information modeling and virtual
   design and construction and flowed through to the construction phase.
   These were seen to enable the creation of connections that were crucial
   to the overall success of the project. These innovations were
   operationalized and enacted through the construction phase as design for
   manufacturing and assembly and prefabrication, staged construction and
   just-in-time delivery, integration of safety and risk management and a
   rigorous quality control and quality assurance process. Finally, a
   full-scale mock-up was produced for practice and constructability
   assessment, materializing the radical product innovation that was the
   mass timber structure. These strategies are used together for a
   synergistic and integrated approach to increase productivity, expedite
   the construction schedule and develop an innovative building product.
   Originality/value
   This paper details an in-depth investigation into the diffusion dynamics
   of multiple systemic innovations for the construction process of a
   unique building project, the tools and techniques used by the
   construction manager and team, and the challenges, solutions and lessons
   learned.},

   Job-Site Safety in Gulf Corporation Council},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the advancement of digital design practices in the global
   construction industry, different aspects related to the project
   lifecycle are extracting their benefits, including making improvements
   in safety. The objective of this paper is to ascertain the awareness of
   these technologies, their potential, and any barriers related to the use
   of different virtual design construction (VDC) tools, such as building
   information modeling, virtual reality, augmented reality, and geographic
   information systems, to improve job-site safety in Gulf Cooperation
   Council (GCC) countries. The paper presents an overview of the GCC
   construction industry and highlights current safety management practices
   and problems in the region. The potential of VDC tools for improving
   job-site safety is discussed and presented. The study has used a
   questionnaire survey to identify the drivers and barriers of using VDC
   tools in improving job-site safety management in the GCC region. The
   results indicated that ``designing emergency and evacuation plans{''}
   and ``fall-hazard prevention strategies{''} are the two best safety
   applications of these tools if used proactively. Similarly, ``lack of
   knowledge about return on investment for VDC tools{''} was considered as
   the predominant barrier, preventing stakeholders from using these
   technologies to improve construction safety. These results will help the
   GCC construction industry to build a strategy for the digitalization of
   proactive constructability analysis techniques for improving job-site
   safety. Overall, due to the multilingual dynamics of this region, it is
   recommended that VDC tools should become more prevalent so that the
   transfer of safety information and hazard prevention becomes easier,
   mitigating safety risks.},

Title = {Rethinking the knowledge bearing capacity of e-Business systems},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-43},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research was conducted in the area of sustainable knowledge extraction
   from e-business systems and technologies by exploring differentiating
   approaches from three notable authors seeking some common denominator to
   apply to a convergent approach in system conceptualization and design.
   It will be argued that most of e-business system upgrades and
   modification cost could be averted if the knowledge bearing capacity of
   proposed systems is realized and included as primary design parameters
   during the System Development Life Cycle. It will furthermore be argued
   that if this inclusive and integrative approach is followed it would
   lead to building a capacity to act that could be utilized for creating
   sustainable competitive advantage. Most e-Business system development is
   approached from an information processing and efficiency dimension,
   which more often than not exclude the knowledge utilization and
   effectiveness component as a design parameter. In most cases the primary
   focus is on information intensive functions, business process
   reengineering/automation and transaction processing whilst the use of
   information to discover knowledge assets and to innovate only comes into
   prominence after system implementation. This line of design thinking
   leads to the emergence of dominant designs which extend the scope for
   standardization whilst simultaneously limiting the scope for system
   variation. It will be proposed that re Boisot (1999), N-learning
   (neo-classical) thinking is normally dominant to S-learning
   (Schumpeterian) thinking during the c-business system design phase. The
   paper primarily draw on Max Boisot's Evolutionary Production Function
   and I-Space theoretical approach, Donald Marchand's Four Fundamental
   Principles of using Information to Create Business Value and Yogesh
   Malhotra's model on Balancing Design and Emergence for E-Business Model
   Innovation. A new construct called the Knowledge Prospect Domain (KPD)
   will be identified and introduced as a common denominator between the
   models of the three authors on which to ground the approach to new
   thinking on e-business system design. To facilitate argumentation an
   attempt will be made to position the extant status of e-business systems
   in the I-Space, referring to what will be proposed as proprietary
   technologies and emergent technologies.},

   Availability model A10/A24: digital construction across the lifecycleThe
   BIM-based project execution in infrastructure construction, especially
   during the construction and maintenance phases, is currently in the
   testing phase. The project Availability model A10/A24 is a national
   pilot project by DEGES on behalf of the Autobahn GmbH commissioned by
   the Federal Republic of Germany, aimed at implementing performance level
   1 of the Digital Design and Construction Roadmap. It is the first
   project that seamlessly integrates design, construction and maintenance
   through BIM, extending beyond existing pilot projects. The clearance for
   traffic of the project took place on November 11, 2022, between
   Neuruppin and Pankow. The design and construction phases were
   consistently executed with BIM for specific section. Over the next 25
   years, the maintenance phase will be conducted based on the handover
   model, including condition data, damages, and maintenance measures. The
   following presents insights from the implementation and execution of the
   BIM project.},

Abstract = {On March 11, 2011, the Tohoku earthquake caused major damage to almost
   all public infrastructures including energy and water facilities in
   Fukushima Prefecture. Following the nuclear disaster, which lead to a
   shortage of energy, the government of Japan enacted new policy measures
   to redefine its energy-mix after its earlier commitment to the
   Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 to reduce greenhouse gas emission by
   25\% from 1990 levels by 2020. In 2015, Japan ratified the Paris Accord
   and set a national greenhouse gas reduction goal - 26\% below 2013
   levels by 2030. To meet this requirement, Japan needs to restructure its
   current electricity consumption by identifying the optimal demand of
   electricity by households, commercial buildings, and public utilities.
   This calls for public infrastructures to manage their electricity
   consumption efficiently by adopting appropriate electricity conservation
   methods using precision monitoring systems. To support the policy of the
   government of Japan toward conservation of energy, in this paper, we
   outline the energy demand of a public utility system, namely a
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, and
   based on the data obtained using an innovative information and
   communication technology (ICT) tool. Using the monitored data, we
   further predict the electricity demand for each process of the WWTP
   using a Markov switching model. These models have high repeatability of
   monitoring results for each process according to various indices. In our
   results, all R-2 values were more than 0.8; mean absolute percentage
   error values were under 10\% for total electricity consumption and the
   water treatment process, and the relative root mean square error rate of
   each process was under 20\%. Based on the results, we developed a future
   electricity consumption prediction model for WWTP total electricity
   consumption and the consumption of each process. The study emphasizes
   the need for an innovative ICT and advanced analysis system for
   supporting the governance of public facilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Today's providers of maintenance and in-service support related to
   modern aircraft are facing major challenges. A central problem with
   Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) as well as support of aircraft
   and other complex technical systems, is to manage the ever-increasing
   information flow and system complexity. Both military and commercial
   operators need to reduce aircraft downtime and maintenance man hours.
   Increased manual information management has the opposite effect,
   inducing unnecessary cost and affect efficiency negatively.
   Organizations developing and providing maintenance support products and
   in-service support does also need to improve the capability to
   efficiently exploit the increasing amount of digital product information
   and design data provided together with hardware (HW) and software (SW)
   products from aircraft manufacturers, sub-system suppliers and Original
   Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). One way to increase aircraft availability
   and improve maintenance and support efficiency, is to speed up the
   turnaround time for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. The ultimate
   goal is risk-based utilization and support, where true Condition-Based
   Maintenance (CBM) is integrated with current operational requirements
   and available resources in real-time. This aims at the elimination of
   all preventive scheduled maintenance based on fixed time intervals and
   execution of only corrective maintenance that has been predicted and
   turned into scheduled maintenance facilitated by proper support. To
   address the challenge of information logistics of digital product data
   and information within maintenance in-service support, providers need to
   adapt new methodologies and tools that enable full utilization of the
   advantages of digital product data and information in processes and
   business models, e.g., Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). To implement
   such improved support solutions in a global-support environment,
   eMaintenance is seen as one important building block. eMaintenance
   includes monitoring, collection, recording and distribution of real-time
   system health data, maintenance-generated data as well as other decision
   and performance-support information to different stakeholders
   independent of organization or geographical location, 24 h a day, 7 days
   a week (24/7). eMaintenance has the potential to improve the management
   and performance of activities related to the whole maintenance process,
   and thereby improve the dependability, safety and Life Cycle Cost (LCC)
   of critical systems. This can be realized through a coordinated
   application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) throughout
   the maintenance and support processes, thus integrating Built-in Test
   (BIT) systems, external tests at different maintenance echelons,
   technical information, diagnostics, prognostics and other sources of
   support information.
   The purpose of this paper is to present some results from a joint
   academic and aerospace industry research project, describing
   requirements and expectations that are important in a global-support
   environment, and also to propose some central components in an
   eMaintenance framework that integrates maintenance and ICT perspectives.

   Addressing the technological, data consistency, organisational, and
   cybersecurity challenges is crucial for the broader adoption of DT
   technology.Abstract Digital Twin (DT) technology is a pivotal innovation
   within the built environment industry, facilitating digital
   transformation through advanced data integration and analytics. DTs have
   demonstrated significant benefits in building design, construction, and
   asset management, including optimising lifecycle energy use, enhancing
   operational efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance, and improving
   user adaptability. By integrating real-time data from IoT sensors with
   advanced analytics, DTs provide dynamic and actionable insights for
   better decision-making and resource management. Despite these promising
   benefits, several challenges impede the widespread adoption of DT
   technology, such as technological integration, data consistency,
   organisational adaptation, and cybersecurity concerns. Addressing these
   challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, standardisation of
   data formats, and the development of universal design and development
   platforms for DTs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of DT
   definitions, applications, capabilities, and challenges within the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries. This paper
   provides important insights for researchers and professionals, helping
   them gain a more comprehensive and detailed view of DT. The findings
   also demonstrate the significant impact that DTs can have on this
   sector, contributing to advancing DT implementations and promoting
   sustainable and efficient building management practices. Ultimately, DT
   technology is set to revolutionise the AEC industries by enabling
   autonomous, data-driven decision-making and optimising building
   operations for enhanced productivity and performance.},

Title = {Sustainability analysis of a society based on exergy studies - a case
   study of the island of Samso (Denmark)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},

Abstract = {The Danish island Sarno has since 1997 initiated a process through which
   the island should reach a state where it would be able to supply its own
   energy. Such a situation was reached since 2005 - after having
   established 21 windmills - and the island is now a net exporter of
   electricity to the Danish power network. At the same time the buildings
   in the more habituated areas were connected to 4 district heating plants
   which generate heat from combustion of straw in some cases combined with
   supplementary inputs from photo thermal devices. Meanwhile, certain
   activities on the island, such as running the ferries, cars, factories
   and heating in more distant areas are still dependent on significant
   input of fossil fuels. The inhabitants have recently stated a wish to
   move on towards being independent of fossil fuels in 2030 and carbon
   neutral during the next decades. As a consequence the idea came up to
   develop a method for the ``sustainability analysis{''} of a society
   which would assist in governing the transitional process in the
   direction of increasing sustainability. Therefore, a framework has been
   developed based on the concept exergy that may reveal where large
   consumptions are taking places. Such areas are likely to be sensible
   targets for action or at least increased attention. Basic methods have
   been developed that allows to account for infrastructure, transfers,
   inputs and outputs, and consumption in terms of exergy, and taking into
   account whether the exergy storages or flows can be considered to be
   renewable or not. The framework has been developed for six societal
   sectors: the energy sector, the public sector, the private households,
   the agricultural sector, the industry, commerce and trade sector and
   nature. Nature is here considered an activity that provides the society
   with an exergy that may also be of value to our societies, often
   referred to as ecosystem services.
   Based on the estimated amount of infrastructure and transfers, inputs
   and outputs a number of ``sustainability indicators{''} have been
   developed that may be monitored over time and which may serve to
   indicate whether potential measures undertaken also lead the society in
   the right direction. An attempt to evaluate the potential importance of
   wastes has also been carried out as in organic waste could play an
   important role in acquiring the amount of bio-diesel required to run the
   ferries in the future.
   The results demonstrate that the already existing overhead in production
   of electricity leaves the island with many options and a great
   opportunity to be independent of fossil fuels in near future. In fact,
   it might well be that socio-economical perspectives will turn out to be
   the more severe obstacles in the transition process. Adjacent to this
   work a carbon model has also been set up to reveal the consequence of
   proposed measures and strategies to the carbon budget of the island
   (Jorgensen and Nielsen, 2014). 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A REVIEW OF DRIVERS AND BARRIERS OF DIGITAL TWIN ADOPTION IN BUILDING
   PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, the AECO Industry has undergone a shift toward
   digital transformation, with a growing trend towards adopting innovative
   technologies such as Digital Twin (DT). DT offers a wide range of
   applications throughout the building development process. However, some
   specific factors impede its widespread adoption in the building
   industry. This study aims to systematically review the available
   literature on the building project development process from the
   perspective of DT, with a particular focus on predictive simulations,
   i.e., co-sims. The review provides a comprehensive overview of drivers
   and barriers to DT adoption through an analysis of 147 studies between
   2013 and 2023. The research identifies seven external and 41 internal
   drivers, including efficient project management and monitoring,
   predictive maintenance, and the collection and visualization of real
   -time data, all of which contribute to improved decision-making
   processes and reduced operational expenses. Further, the study
   identifies nine external and 31 internal barriers that impede the
   adoption of DT in the building development process. These barriers
   encompass challenges such as a high initial investment cost, a scarcity
   of a skilled workforce, difficulties in data interoperability, and
   resistance to change within the organization. A key outcome of the
   literature review is having identified the opportunity to exploit
   technologies developed in the automotive sector that enable a seamless
   integration of specialized simulator models in building development
   processes, resulting in collaborative simulations. Thus, we propose the
   concept of a Building Simulation Identity Card (BSIC) to be pursued in
   future research that would enable stakeholders to address the challenges
   of collaboration, cooperation, coordination, and communication by
   creating a common vocabulary to effectively facilitate the adoption of
   DT in the building's development process.},

Title = {A novel cloud manufacturing framework with auto-scaling capability for
   the machining industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {7},
Pages = {786-804},
Abstract = {The globalised machine-tool manufacturing enterprises are eager to
   develop intelligent machine tools and novel business models to increase
   their competitiveness. In recent years, cloud manufacturing,
   encapsulating distributed manufacturing resources into cloud services
   for supporting all tasks in a product life cycle, has emerged as a
   promising concept and approach for the machining industry to achieve
   such a goal and gain profits. However, there has been no systematic
   approach to the development of cloud manufacturing systems (CMSs) for
   the machining industry so far. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud
   manufacturing framework (CMF) with auto-scaling capability (called
   CMFAS) aimed at providing a systematic and rapid development approach
   for building CMSs. The proposed CMFAS contains a cloud-based
   architecture which can transform single-user manufacturing functions
   (MFs) into cloud services that can be accessed by many users
   simultaneously. Also, a user-acceptable time-based scaling algorithm is
   designed so that the CMFAS can automatically perform scale-out or
   scale-in on the number of virtual machines (VMs) according to the user
   arrival rate, while confining the average service time for a user to be
   less than a specified user-acceptable time using a minimum number of
   VMs. Finally, we develop an Ontology Inference Cloud Service (OICS) for
   machine tools based on the CMFAS and deploy it on a public cloud
   platform for conducting integrated tests. Testing results show that the
   OICS can successfully recommend proper machine tools and cutting tools
   for machining tasks, and the proposed scaling algorithm outperforms
   traditional CPU-load-based scaling algorithms in terms of a smaller
   average service time for a user (i.e. quicker processing time) and a
   smaller number of created VMs (i.e. less cost of leasing cloud
   resources). The proposed CMFAS, together with its detailed designs, can
   serve as a useful reference approach for systematically and rapidly
   building CMSs for the machining industry.},

Title = {Integrated practices in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction
   industry: Current scope and pathway towards Industry 5.0},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {73},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Integrated practices (IPs) entail holistic and inclusive approaches
   geared toward synergizing building project participants, processes,
   technology, information, and contract arrangements along the project
   delivery lifecycle. The application of integrated approaches is gaining
   mo-mentum in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   industry. Over the last decades, building construction research has been
   fueled by the quest to develop integrated procedures, tools, standards,
   and systems to aid project implementation. Yet, research that offers a
   holistic view of emerging concepts is currently lacking. This study
   presents a bibliometric review of 573 works on IPs in the AEC industry,
   which were published in 258 academic sources and authored by 1415
   scholars. Three major IPs were examined, namely: integrated design
   process (IDP), modular integrated construction (MIC), and integrated
   project delivery (IPD), alongside other concepts. The Bibliometrix
   function in R tool (Biblioshiny) was used to analyze bibliographic data
   collected from Scopus. The research networks were presented in terms of
   annual contributions, scientific productivity, geographical
   distribution, and global relevance. Bibliographic factorial analysis
   uncovered six underlying research clusters/elements, which were
   categorized into the critical elements of IPs and the enablers of IPs.
   The critical elements of IPs include (1) design element, (2)
   construction management element, (3) delivery method and supply chain
   element, while the enablers of IPs consist of (1) technological
   enablers, (2) BIM enablers, and (3) training and ed-ucation enablers.
   Based on these clusters, the gaps in current knowledge are noted. The
   need to expand the current research domain on IPs in alignment with the
   core values of Industry 5.0 is discussed.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},

Abstract = {The complexity of nowadays car manufacturing processes increases
   constantly due to the increasing number of electronic and digital
   features in cars as well as the shorter life cycle of car designs, which
   raises the need for faster adaption to new car models. However, the
   ongoing digitalization of production and working contexts offers the
   chance to support the worker in production using digital information as
   well as innovative, interactive, and digital devices. Therefore, in this
   work we investigate a representative production step in a long-term
   project together with a German car manufacturer, which is structured
   into three phases. In the first phase, we investigated the working
   process empirically and developed a comprehensive and innovative user
   interface design, which addresses various types of interactive devices.
   Building up on this, we developed the device score model, which is
   designed to investigate interactive system and user interface in
   production context due to ergonomics, UI design, performance, technology
   acceptance, and user experience. This work was conducted in the second
   phase of the project, in which we used this model to investigate the
   subjective suitability of six innovative device setups that implement
   the user interface design developed in phase one in an experimental
   setup with 67 participants at two locations in south Germany. The major
   result showed that the new user interface design run on a smart phone is
   the most suitable setup for future interactive systems in car
   manufacturing. In the third and final phase, we investigated the
   suitability of the two best rated devices for long term use by two
   workers using the system during a full shift. These two systems were
   compared with the standard system used. The major conclusion is that
   smartphones as well as AR glasses show very high potential to increase
   performance in production if used in a well-designed fashion.},

Title = {Evaluating a mixed abiotic-biotic model for the distribution and host
   contact rates of an arthropod vector of pathogens: An example with
   <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> (Ixodidae)},
Journal = {MICROBIAL RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Modelling the range of prominent vectors of pathogens is a common
   technique used for planning surveys, building exposure assessment
   estimations or addressing the impact of future climate scenarios. In
   most cases the recorded distribution of a target species is used
   together several environmental variables to capture its potential
   distribution, ignoring the availability of adequate hosts for the
   arthropod. In this study we used satellite-recorded, Fourier
   transformed, environmental variables of ground temperature and
   vegetation (NDVI) and a large dataset of records of the tick Ixodes
   ricinus and their hosts. The aim is to evaluate the influence of the
   contact rates of the ticks with the different hosts and how they impact
   on the raw, environmental-based distribution of the tick. These effects
   may alter the estimations of the distribution of the tick under future
   climate scenarios. This study demonstrated that the relative
   contribution of the hosts supporting the feeding of the tick life stages
   dramatically altered the expected distribution of the tick. In the study
   case, results support that both Passeriformes (Aves) and
   Rodentia-Soricomorpha contribute in different ways to the colonization
   of the tick along a large latitudinal gradient. However, Artiodactyla
   are the main supporters of the tick and enhance its presence in the
   fringe of its distribution area. Thus, complete data on the distribution
   of each host contributing to the tick's life cycle and their relative
   importance for the tick, should be included in the assessment of
   exposure by arthropods. Other results of the study suggested that more
   information could be obtained exploring the association of the arthropod
   to the variables in the environmental niche, instead of the classic
   approach based on a crude evaluation on the geographical space (maps).},

Title = {Re-estimating software effort using prior phase efforts and data mining

Abstract = {Software effort estimation has played an important role in software
   project management. An accurate estimation helps reduce cost overrun and
   the eventual project failure. Unfortunately, many existing estimation
   techniques rely on the total project effort which is often determined
   from the project life cycle. As the project moves on, the course of
   action deviates from what originally has planned, despite close
   monitoring and control. This leads to re-estimating software effort so
   as to improve project operating costs and budgeting. Recent research
   endeavors attempt to explore phase level estimation that uses known
   information from prior development phases to predict effort of the next
   phase by using different learning techniques. This study aims to
   investigate the influence of preprocessing in prior phases on learning
   techniques to re-estimate the effort of next phase. The proposed
   re-estimation approach preprocesses prior phase effort by means of
   statistical techniques to select a set of input features for learning
   which in turn are exploited to generate the estimation models. These
   models are then used to re-estimate next phase effort by using four
   processing steps, namely data transformation, outlier detection, feature
   selection, and learning. An empirical study is conducted on 440
   estimation models being generated from combinations of techniques on 5
   data transformation, 5 outlier detection, 5 feature selection, and 5
   learning techniques. The experimental results show that suitable
   preprocessing is significantly useful for building proper learning
   techniques to boosting re-estimation accuracy. However, there is no one
   learning technique that can outperform other techniques over all phases.
   The proposed re-estimation approach yields more accurate estimation than
   proportion-based estimation approach. It is envisioned that the proposed
   re-estimation approach can facilitate researchers and project managers
   on re-estimating software effort so as to finish the project on time and
   within the allotted budget.},

   responsiveness due to the lack of understanding the mediating
   mechanisms. Empirical research that studies the mechanisms underlying
   the impact of product lifecycle management systems on market
   responsiveness has been scarce. To address the research issues, this
   study draws on dynamic capability view and the notion of information
   technology - business capability - organizational performance links to
   develop a theoretical model and employs empirical research methods to
   evaluate the model. The research results reveal that product lifecycle
   management system implementation allows firms to increase market
   responsiveness through the two enhanced partner management capabilities,
   namely relationship-building capability and coordination capability. By
   clearly identifying the underlying mechanism of product lifecycle
   management system-enabled market responsiveness, this study advances the
   current understanding of how product lifecycle management system
   implementation enables firms to improve market responsiveness.},

Abstract = {With the stability of the IFC model has come an increasing use of its
   application on real projects and in real working situations. A result of
   this is an awareness that attention has to be paid to surrounding issues
   to ensure that IFC use (and Building Information Modeling in general)
   delivers on the promise of better ways of working for the AEC/FM
   industry.
   This awareness is particularly seen in Norway where there is a keen
   interest in these topics driven by encouragement of the State Building
   Authority to use BIM and IFC. This has led to development of product
   libraries, implementation of regulations systems, interest in
   requirements specification and a focus on applications of data in
   discrete process steps. Individually, each of these topics has been the
   subject of substantial research and development. However, the extent of
   concurrent development in Norway is making consideration of the outcomes
   of work into a necessity.
   This paper will discuss the development of a Framework of Information
   for Construction that takes account of data throughout the project
   lifecycle and in support of data exchange contracts/validation for
   specific processes, dictionary/ontology definition, product libraries,
   regulatory approaches, early stage planning and more. It will highlight
   the background leading to the development and indicate the projects that
   are creating the need for the development. The `Information Delivery
   Manual' (IDM) will be shown as a key deliverable that unites user
   requirements with software solutions and its use for validating
   information content and quality in processes demonstrated. Application
   of the IDM to ongoing projects will be presented.},

Title = {Early predicting cooling loads for energy-efficient design in office
   buildings by machine learning},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Energy-efficient building design has become imperative for energy
   conservation, emissions reduction, and life quality enhancement of
   occupant. Physics-based whole building energy simulation is widely used
   to access building energy performance, which requires large amount of
   information to specify values of input parameters and includes
   underlying assumptions. This study proposed an alternative model based
   on machine learning (ML) to predict cooling loads of buildings with few
   common parameters in the design phase. The ML models were developed and
   evaluated using a dataset of 243 buildings. Predicted cooling loads from
   these models were compared to those from the physics-based whole
   building energy simulation. The proposed model exhibits good agreement
   with the physics-based whole building energy simulation. The analytical
   results present that the ML models obtained the correlation coefficient
   (R) of 0.98-0.99, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of
   6.17-12.93\% which shows the high agreement between observed and
   predicted values of cooling loads in building. Notably, the ensemble
   bagging artificial neural networks yielded the highest R of 0.99, the
   lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 158.77 kW, the lowest MAE of
   112.07 kW, and the lowest MAPE of 6.17\% among all models in this study.
   This research contributes to (i) the state of the knowledge by examining
   various ML models that can predict cooling loads in the early building
   design stage; and (ii) the state of practice by providing an alternative
   tool in the design process through better understanding of relationships
   between building cooling loads and building characteristics for
   enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Challenges in the extraction and use of earth resources and spaces are
   encountered given a growing worldwide population, rising infrastructures
   development, and widespread climate change. In Australia, mining and
   construction are two major bases for economic growth while both being
   traditional hazardous and heavy industries. A nation-wide infrastructure
   upgrade featuring large-scale underground development is underway, the
   geological uncertainties and localisation difficulties of already laid
   infrastructure are associated with challenges not seen in building
   construction. A safer and competent subterranean transport solution is
   yet proposed in the context of sustainable developments. In light of
   this, geotechnical analysis as a fundamental subject for developing and
   maintaining safe and sustainable use of underground space has huge
   potential to be undertaken more intuitively considering the advancements
   in information management and visualisation. The PhD work examines the
   state-of-the-art applications, limitations and future opportunities of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other computational techniques
   in the digitisation of tunnelling and underground construction. The
   visualisation and interoperability facilitated by data-driven processes
   are especially important to underground construction that engages
   interdisciplinary and multi-environment interaction.},

Title = {Towards an Integrated Approach to Infrastructure Damage Assessment in
   the Aftermath of Natural Hazards},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The world has witnessed an alarmingly increasing number of serious
   natural hazards. In the aftermath of a hazard, relevant
   authorities/agencies face, among others, the challenging tasks of
   rapidly evaluating and assessing the damages to infrastructures and
   restoring their essential functionality and operation. The availability
   of reliable, high-quality structural and operational/maintenance data of
   a structure and its health, before and after a natural hazard, can be
   instrumental in the rapid assessment of a damaged structure. We
   collectively refer, in this paper, to the existing as-built and facility
   operational information about a structure or an infrastructure asset
   represented respectively in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   Infrastructure Asset Management (IAM) systems as Product Lifecycle Data
   (PLD). Arguably, PLD combined with other post-hazard condition
   assessment data can provide a more reliable and integrated solution for
   a rapid damage assessment of buildings and other critical
   infrastructures. Unfortunately, the application of PLD in this critical
   area has been unexplored in the literature, and the mapping between PLD
   and damage assessment methods is loosely investigated. In an effort to
   address this research gap, this paper provides a critical analysis of
   the most common structural damage assessment methods and explores the
   potential of combining them with PLD to provide more reliable,
   comprehensive, and integrated solution for damage assessment. Findings
   from this study could be useful for practitioners in selecting the most
   appropriate and effective methods to conduct damage and safety
   assessments of critical infrastructures. The study will also assist the
   further theoretical developments in the integration of PLD with
   different damage assessment methods.},

Abstract = {Given the urgent need to enhance industry practices in a green, safe,
   and economical manner, facilitating the wider adoption of green
   procurement in building developments has been a major concern of the
   construction industry. This paper aims to provide insight into the
   factors that are important in enhancing green procurement in the
   construction process and to suggest recommendations for the effective
   adoption of green procurement through a questionnaire survey and expert
   interviews. The top three most significant factors identified are
   mandatory environmental regulations by the government, client
   requirements in tendering, and government and non-governmental
   organization requirements. The results of a factor analysis of 35
   variables identify 10 underlying grouped factors for facilitating
   effective green procurement in Hong Kong's construction industry. The
   factor group ``Regulations and standards of green procurement by the
   government{''} is the most significant, followed by ``Life-cycle
   considerations and green construction technology{''} and ``Executive
   management's commitments and requirements.{''} Efforts or initiatives
   undertaken by the community and the government on green procurement,
   such as competitions/awards, incentive schemes, and executives' green
   procurement commitments and requirements, are considered important in
   the green procurement process. The experts interviewed indicated that
   the government should take a proactive role in pushing green procurement
   adoption. Advanced construction IT (e.g., BIM) should be employed to
   stimulate the construction process to incorporate a green design
   approach and reduce waste. In addition, the establishment of a fully
   functioning green material market would help to promote the concept of
   green procurement and gradually lower material costs. Active engagement
   of suppliers to provide the performance details of construction
   materials is also necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Industrialized house building companies producing single-family housing
   must efficiently respond to customer needs and contingent requirements

   building systems to product platforms. Moreover, the design process is
   considered during both product predefinition and product specification.
   The theoretical construct of design modules is used to describe flexible

Title = {BuildingSync: A schema for commercial building energy audit data
   exchange},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Numerous data formats exist to exchange building related information
   throughout a building's lifecycle; many are all-encompassing formats
   while some newer formats are focused on specific software data exchange
   between actors such as system to system, system to user, or user to
   user. Despite this, data format challenges occur during each iteration
   of a commercial building energy audit. To overcome these challenges,
   BuildingSync has been designed to harmonize building data exchange
   during building energy audits. The schema was developed to be
   interoperable to support various use cases such as reporting audits in
   an electronic format, tracking proposed, implemented, and discarded
   energy conservation measures, and storing building characteristics (at
   multiple levels) for audits, benchmarking, and building energy analysis.
   This article will review the commercial building data exchange
   landscape, detail the development of BuildingSync, and provide examples
   of its use in the built environment.},

   traffic node driven by mathematics-modeling},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 16},
Abstract = {The intelligent design of complex transportation nodes is an important
   way to improve urban transportation efficiency and safety. However,
   currently, there are still problems with low data acquisition and
   processing accuracy and high-technology application costs in complex
   transportation nodes. Therefore, the research attempts to achieve the
   intelligent design of complex traffic node organizations based on
   digital analogue-driven and integrated building information models and
   optimization graph convolution algorithms. It aims to achieve real-time
   monitoring and analysis of traffic information to improve the overall
   performance of the transportation system. These experiments confirmed
   that the studied BIM could achieve full lifecycle management of urban
   interchanges, and could achieve strain analysis and trend prediction
   based on time series. When the organizational members were 122, the
   information channels for smart stations based on research technology
   were 241, which improved information efficiency by more than 90\%. When
   the sensor node was 48, the predicted values of the research model based
   on the optimization graph convolution algorithm were consistent with the
   actual values, with a prediction accuracy of 95\%. Therefore, the
   technology studied in this study can provide reliable solutions for the
   design of complex traffic nodes and support traffic management
   decisions.},

Title = {Information lifecycle management with RFID for material control on

Abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an emerging technology in the
   building industry. Many researchers have demonstrated how to enhance
   material control or production management with RFID. However, there is a
   lack of integrated understanding of lifecycle management. This paper
   develops and demonstrates a framework to Information Lifecycle
   Management (ILM) with RFID for material control. The ILM framework
   includes key RFID checkpoints and material types to facilitate material
   control on construction sites. In addition, this paper presents a
   context-aware scenario to examine multiple on-site context and RFID
   parameters. From tagging nodes at the factory to reading nodes at each
   lifecycle stage, this paper demonstrates how to manage complex
   construction materials with RFID and how to construct integrated
   information flows at different lifecyde stages. To validate key material
   types and the scenario, the study reports on two on-site trials: read
   distance test and on-site simulation. Finally, the research provides
   discussion and recommended approaches to implementing ILM. The results
   show that the ILM framework has the potential for a variety of
   stakeholders to adopt RFID in the building industry. This paper provides
   the understanding about the effectiveness of ILM with RFID for material
   control, which can serve as a base for adopting other IT technologies in
   the building industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This work studies the problem of identifying risk factors of Small for
   Gestational Age (SGA) and building classifiers for SGA prediction.
   Recently, SGA infants have received more and more concerns as this
   illness brings many difficulties to them along with their whole life.
   Some experts have begun to study the risk factors of SGA onset by using
   traditional statistical ways. Others have used logistic regression (LR)
   to construct SGA prediction models. Meanwhile, machine learning have
   evolved and envisioned as a tool able to potentially identify babies
   with SGA. This work tests several feature selection methods. Based on
   the risk factors obtained through them, it trains support vector
   machine, random forest, and LR models and evaluates them via 10-fold
   cross validation in terms of precision and area under the curve of
   receiver operator characteristic curve. The results show that sparse LR
   of the wrapper algorithms owns the best feature selection effectiveness.
   In addition, this work compares data driven factors and knowledge driven
   factors and shows that the feature selection is necessary and effective.
   Among the trained classifiers, the LR model achieves the best
   performance on the data driven factors.},

Title = {Thermal performance improvement for residential heritage building
   preservation based on digital twins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Excessive temperatures can result in the collapse of structural
   components, cracking, scaling, and condensation in heritage building
   structures. Numerous unregenerated residential heritage buildings use
   portable heaters to adjust the indoor temperature for the comfort of
   occupants. However, research on the impact of heaters on the
   preservation of heritage buildings is limited. This paper proposes a
   novel and systematic approach based on digital twin technology to
   improve thermal performance effectively in unregenerated heritage
   buildings by arranging the locations and settings of heaters for
   improving building preservation. This research extended the
   functionality of heritage building information modeling (HBIM) to
   support simulations and decisionmaking to improve the thermal
   performance for heritage building preservation. An approach was proposed
   to address the lack of information by integrating documents,
   information, and graphics into an HBIM model for heritage building
   preservation. The digital model process based on HBIM presented in this
   study can be an effective 3D model for computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations. To investigate the impact of the heater on heritage
   building deformation, a novel method was developed to couple CFD and
   structural simulation to analyze the thermal performance and building
   deformation of heritage buildings. The heritage building deformation
   resulting from the heaters' power setting and location was identified
   and quantified. In addition, using the proposed digital twin platform,
   heaters were controlled automatically. The thermal performance, building
   cracking and deformation were monitored and recorded automatically along
   the lifecycle. The improved heater location reduced the maximum total
   deformation of the heritage building body by at least 62.9 \%.},

Abstract = {This paper shows the result of a research project aiming at the
   development of a systemic approach for the energy-efficient and
   cost-effective facade retrofitting of buildings deploying the potential
   of external insulation prefabricated panels.
   In particular, an innovative composite panel (an EPS panel coated on
   both sides with two layers of Textile Reinforced Concrete - TRC) has
   been developed taking into account different parameters (mechanical
   properties, hygrothermal properties and environmental impact) and the
   potential of application on existing residential buildings in Europe. As
   a matter of fact, issues as lightness, fast and easy assembly techniques
   were also a major concern of the Research \& Development process: the
   application without fixed scaffolds has been considered so as to reduce
   impact on inhabitants' life. Besides, considering some limitations on
   interventions of existing European building stock, the concept of the
   innovative panel has been developed so as to allow for the preservation
   of the building envelope exterior features or at improving the
   architectural features with a reduced extra-load on the existing
   structure.
   Cost-effectiveness of the solution has been demonstrated considering
   optimization through the whole design and construction process, also
   exploiting the application of advanced design tools and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM).
   The installation process and the real performances of the panels are
   investigated on a test-facade at Politecnico di Milano Campus: the first
   outputs of the test campaign are shown in this report, as well.},

Abstract = {The paper presents some results of the research into a development of a
   cost estimating model that is capable of using information from building
   information model and implementing machine learning for cost prediction.
   Accurate estimates, provided throughout the whole construction project,
   allow for actual cost savings and assist in achieving sustainability
   goals. The model which is based on the support vector regression and
   radial basis kernel functions has been developed and proposed to support
   cost estimates of building's floor structural frames. The author's main
   assumption was to combine the benefits of building information modelling
   - namely the ability to extract certain information about the building
   and structural members of the floor frames from the models and the
   capabilities of machine learning. The research, presented in this paper,
   came down to solving a regression problem with the use of the support
   vectors approach. The training data for machine learning included inputs
   that represented features of the building and structural members'
   belonging to the floor structural frames and outputs that represented
   corresponding real life cost estimates of the floor structural frames.
   The obtained results show that the proposed model allows predicting

Title = {A Benefits Prioritization Analysis on Adopting BIM Systems Against Major
   Challenges in Megaproject Delivery},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {PurposeThis article presents a recent research and development
   experiment on benefits analysis for adopting building information
   modeling/management (BIM) systems in megaproject delivery across work
   stages with regard to the needs of project stakeholders. It focuses on a
   new approach to benefits prioritization to support decision making
   against major challenges in megaproject delivery. MethodologyThe study
   was underpinned by an extensive literature review on relevant research
   and practices across the world, and a questionnaire-based survey on the
   benefits from adopting BIM in megaproject delivery in Australia. In
   addition, this study yields new tools for value analysis with regard to
   the adoption of BIM systems in megaproject delivery, and this include a
   new calculation method for benefits prioritization, and a new value
   compass tool to support decisions making on BIM adoption.
   FindingsThrough the extensive literature review that covers
   multidisciplinary areas relating to the use of BIM, a set of generic
   hypotheses was formulated on the comparative level of technical value
   that various stakeholder groups are expected to achieve from adopting
   BIM systems in megaproject delivery. These hypotheses were tested by
   using the questionnaire-based survey. A new benefits prioritization
   approach was developed to identify the key benefits of BIM systems in
   megaproject delivery. In addition, a compass tool was also developed to
   visualize the status of value achievement across project stakeholders in
   dealing with major challenges in megaproject delivery. Implications for
   Research and PracticesBy using data collected from the Australian
   megaproject sector in addition to academic review in Australia, China,
   and United Kingdom, this experimental study revealed current
   professional perceptions on the benefits of adopting BIM systems in
   megaproject delivery in comparison with data and information reported by
   professionals concerning the adoption of BIM systems from both generic
   and specific point of view across multiple megaproject stakeholders.
   ValueThis article provides useful information for both academic research
   and practical services in the context of quantitative Cost-Benefit
   Analysis (CBA) on the adoption of BIM systems in megaproject delivery
   when major challenges on professional competence, budget, schedule and
   sustainability need to be seriously dealt with. Findings from this
   experimental study can inform value engineering practice at both
   strategic and tactic level with regard to adopting BIM systems in
   megaproject delivery.},

Abstract = {The Public Private Partnership (PPP) plays a significant role in the
   construction industry. It is of special importance because of its weight
   in the global economy and the lack of funding for major projects. The
   PPP concept, as a procurement strategy, is successful only if the major
   stakeholders, namely the public sector, private consortium, and end
   users are all satisfied with project outcomes. There have been reported
   cases of problems associated with the initial stages of the PPP process
   in terms of bidding costs and anticipated costs of construction and
   operation. The banks' attention is currently centered on the promotors'
   financial stability rather than on project quality. The key issue is to
   improve the efficiency for the whole building lifecycle. In this
   context, BIMM philosophy (not just Building Information Modeling but
   also Information Management) may be a powerful tool. In other words, is
   there room to put this concept in practice without jeopardizing service
   quality, innovation and efficiency? The answer to this question is
   explored in this paper. The use of Technical Sheets for PPP procurement
   like policy models may enhance systematic and integrated management of
   the whole building process. This technical framework allows one to
   collect project data, grouped into three areas: design, construction,
   and operation. In so doing, a Public Agency may assess project quality.},

Title = {Sustainable and Resilient Engineering for Facade Design under
   Uncertainty in the Tropics},

   A-CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Traditional facade design practices are mostly based on the designers'
   intuition or a single performance criterion such as U- and g-values,
   which only describe a single facade property. However, facade optimal
   design in an early stage has a significant influence on the final
   overall building performance in regard to energy consumption, economical
   cost, CO2 emission, etc. The main challenge is represented by several
   sources of uncertainty during the life-cycle. In this paper, the goal of
   finding a sustainable facade design solution is addressed through the
   reliability framework of sustainable and resilient engineering (SRE),
   which is used to predict probabilistic performances, whereas the design
   alternatives are ranked through the multiattribute utility theory. The
   adopted metric for ranking these alternatives is the generalized
   expected utility (GEU), which incorporates the expected utility as a
   particular case. It is recognized that, under limited and incomplete
   information, decision-makers are risk-averse, which may provide a
   suboptimal design. Within the GEU, the optimal design under uncertainty
   is modeled through superquantiles, which allow evaluating the optimal
   design with respect to frequent events (i.e., service limit states) and
   extreme events (i.e., ultimate limit state). It is shown that SRE can
   include traditional design approaches as particular cases. The main
   features of the proposed framework are demonstrated through an
   application to a facade design of a hypothetical commercial office in
   Singapore with three types of facade options. With the output of the
   simulations through the EnergyPlus software, the alternatives are
   successfully ranked using SRE and compared with traditional design
   practices. The case study shows that the proposed methodology has the
   potential to overcome the limitation of the current design process and
   to guide the procurement processes in early facade design.
   Under the growing climate crisis, the environmental impact's relief
   requirements have motivated the design of sustainable buildings.
   Traditional facade design practices are mostly based on designers'
   intuition, personal experience, and provisions of national codes and
   standards. This approach may be neither efficient nor flexible and can
   only satisfy the minimum requirements of the projects and national
   design standards. Actually, it is quite likely to fail in meeting
   requirements of different involved stakeholders, especially with the
   reference to sustainable design. In this study, a novel multicriteria
   early-stage designs of building facades, grounded on a framework of
   sustainable and resilient engineering, is presented. The comprehensive
   consideration of the uncertainties within the decision-making process
   provides interpretability and explainability to the design choices,
   e.g., the moisture effect on the uncertainty of the thermal conductivity
   of opaque facade materials. A benchmark case study shows that: (1)
   sustainable design may sometimes be hardly incorporated by the
   traditional design approaches; (2) the current practices may give rise
   to unconservative designs; and (3) the proposed approach is a viable
   solution for sustainable facade designs.},

Title = {Fast and Automatic Reconstruction of Semantically Rich 3D Indoor Maps
   from Low-quality RGB-D Sequences},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Semantically rich indoor models are increasingly used throughout a
   facility's life cycle for different applications. With the decreasing
   price of 3D sensors, it is convenient to acquire point cloud data from
   consumer-level scanners. However, most existing methods in 3D indoor
   reconstruction from point clouds involve a tedious manual or interactive
   process due to line-of-sight occlusions and complex space structures.
   Using the multiple types of data obtained by RGB-D devices, this paper
   proposes a fast and automatic method for reconstructing semantically
   rich indoor 3D building models from low-quality RGB-D sequences. Our
   method is capable of identifying and modelling the main structural
   components of indoor environments such as space, wall, floor, ceilings,
   windows, and doors from the RGB-D datasets. The method includes space
   division and extraction, opening extraction, and global optimization.
   For space division and extraction, rather than distinguishing room
   spaces based on the detected wall planes, we interactively define the
   start-stop position for each functional space (e.g., room, corridor,
   kitchen) during scanning. Then, an interior elements filtering algorithm
   is proposed for wall component extraction and a boundary generation
   algorithm is used for space layout determination. For opening
   extraction, we propose a new noise robustness method based on the
   properties of convex hull, octrees structure, Euclidean clusters and the
   camera trajectory for opening generation, which is inapplicable to the
   data collected in the indoor environments due to inevitable occlusion. A
   global optimization approach for planes is designed to eliminate the
   inconsistency of planes sharing the same global plane, and maintain
   plausible connectivity between the walls and the relationships between
   the walls and openings. The final model is stored according to the
   CityGML3.0 standard. Our approach allows for the robust generation of
   semantically rich 3D indoor models and has strong applicability and
   reconstruction power for complex real-world datasets.},

Title = {Performing Fatigue State Characterization in Railway Steel Bridges Using
   Digital Twin Models},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Railway infrastructures play a pivotal role in developing the national
   transportation system. Recently, the strategy of the railway engineer
   has been significantly shifted; along with the development of new
   assets, they tend to pay increasing attention to the operation and
   management of existing railway assets. In this regard, this paper
   proposes a Digital Twin (DT) model to improve fatigue assessment
   efficiency in the operational processes of railway steel bridges (RSBs).
   The DT concept mainly lies in the federation and interaction of a
   Fatigue Analysis System (FAS), which is based on Eurocodes principles,
   and a model in Building Information Modeling (BIM). Along with the
   proposed DT concept, a prototyping system for a real bridge is initiated
   and curated. The FAS is validated in good-agreement results with the
   ambient vibration test of the bridge (about 1.6\% variation between
   numerical and experimental values), and close values were found between
   numerical and experimental stresses, the latter obtained by installing
   strain gauges on the bridge. The BIM model provides access to the
   numerical values of fatigue state results in a given bridge connection
   detail but also automatically represents that information in a 3D
   environment using a color-scale-based visualization process.
   Furthermore, a simulation model with the main input variables being the
   traffic and geometric conditions of the bridge is continuously updated
   for timely re-evaluation of the damage state, which shows promise for
   the lifecycle management of the bridge.},

   Barriers on Sustainable Building Projects: A Novel Mathematical Partial
   Least Squares-SEM Method},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The sustainable building concept must be implemented throughout the
   project lifecycle to achieve the highest proceeds without lowering the
   standard. Although implementing green walls in emerging nations is
   partial, such studies have concentrated on drivers for implementing
   green walls. Conversely, there is less proof to comprehensively study
   the impact of implementing green walls' overall sustainable success
   (OSS) concerning the lifecycle of projects. This research focuses on the
   green wall adoption barriers in construction projects in third-world
   nations. It assesses the effect of addressing green wall (GW) adoption
   obstacles on OSS throughout the project lifespan. Therefore, a broader
   review of the literature is needed for conceptual model development.
   Structural equation modelling and partial least square (SEM-PLS) have
   been developed employing a survey evaluation tool (i.e., questionnaire).
   Information was derived from one hundred and five building professionals
   in Nigeria. The model output revealed that eradicating GWs barriers had
   a slight to intermediate influence on OSS during the construction
   scheme's lifespan. These results offer the foundation for policymaking
   in third-world nations regarding successful project completion through
   evading barriers to green wall adoption. Similarly, green walls
   implementation will enhance the building project's success.},

Abstract = {For performing design tasks in a process plant construction project
   using a three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design system, it is
   necessary to build a library to save catalogs containing information on
   3D shape, specifications, and ports for bulk materials, such as pipes
   and fittings, or custom-built equipment, such as large equipment and
   skids. Furthermore, a library must be effectively reused as the building
   process requires considerable time and cost. In this study, a system
   architecture that manages the entire lifecycle of a catalog is proposed
   for generating, saving, and managing a neutral catalog for components
   and for converting to a native format of a commercial system needed by
   users. Subsequently, detailed technologies required to implement such
   architecture are discussed. Lastly, experiments on building, searching,
   and exchanging are conducted for approximately 3000 catalogs provided by
   company P in Korea to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   architecture for lifecycle management of a component catalog.},

Title = {APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN IN PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF BUILDING
   SERVICES: A CRITICAL AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {635-661},
Abstract = {Building services systems are essential for creating a comfortable and
   safe living environment in buildings. These are complex systems with
   high stakeholder involvement, a lengthy lifecycle, and high financial
   costs. This leads to building services systems having complex
   procurement and management (P\&M) requirements which create a multitude
   of challenges. Blockchain technology has emerged as a revolutionary
   digital technology under ``Procurement 4.0{''}. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the applicability of blockchain technology for
   systematic procurement and management of building services. The science
   mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyse 102
   publications related to bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus and
   the Web of Science databases. This includes content analysis of the
   existing issues, current trends of technologies, and applicability of
   blockchain in the P\&M of building services. The results of the
   bibliometric analysis indicate that publications had grown significantly
   faster in 2021 related to the P\&M of building services with new
   technologies while there is a minimal collaboration of countries,
   organisations and authors in publishing research in this area. Further,
   it is observed that Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the main
   technology utilised in general P\&M. As a result of content analysis, a
   total of 28 issues that affect the performance of procurement and
   management of building services are identified. The paper critically
   evaluates blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer networks,
   hashing algorithms, public key cryptography, consensus mechanisms, smart
   contracts, and distributed ledger. It indicates that blockchain provides
   a perfect match for resolving these issues. The findings of the research
   will open a path to apply blockchain technology in building services.
   The study offers a readily available point of reference for
   practitioners, policymakers and research and development bodies.},

Title = {Exploring lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of a case study
   with ambitious energy compensation goals in a cooling-dominated climate},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {302-314},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Achieving low operational energy (OE) consumption in high heating and
   cooling situations typically leads to well-insulated buildings. In those
   cases, embodied energy (EE) can exceed the operational share. Specific
   literature refers mostly to heating-dominated residential buildings,
   with a clear focus on European, Asian, and North American countries.
   Information on embodied impacts of buildings other regions is virtually
   inexistent. This paper aims at estimating lifecycle energy and
   greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of selected design versions of a
   photovoltaic-powered Living Lab in Campinas, Brazil; and at finding the
   embodied-to-operational impact ratios as well as the main contributors
   to those overall impacts. Homer Energy software supported sizing of
   photovoltaic (PV) arrays for ten energy compensation scenarios to, based
   on simulated OE, determine the feasibility threshold for onsite
   generation admitted by the building design. We then modelled lifecycle
   energy and GHG emissions for the net zero (NZE) and threshold energy
   positive (E+) versions of the case study design. The Cumulative Energy
   Demand (CED) and the CML 2001 v.2.05 methods supported embodied energy
   and global warming potential (GWP) calculations in SimaPro 7.3. The E+
   building compensates its OE plus non-renewable energy embodied in
   building products. Steel frame and partitions were the largest
   contributors to EEG in building products, whilst the insulated facade
   panels and PV array performed key energy performance roles at
   comparatively lower embodied impacts. Shifting from NZE towards E+
   status discretely increased the embodied-to-operational energy ratio
   (EE:OE), at similar embodied-to-operational GHG emissions (EG:OG)
   ratios. Pre-use share of lifecycle CED was slightly surpassed by the
   operational one, whilst responding for 60\% of lifecycle GWP. Material
   replacement over the reference service life contributed significantly to
   operational impacts. EOL treatment had negligible effect on lifecycle
   impacts. EE more than tripled OE and embodied emissions exceeded OG by a
   factor of seven. EEG prominence confirms the crucial need for a
   harmonized calculation approach, as experienced for operational stage
   accountancy over the recent years. We acknowledge the high uncertainties
   involved in using simulated over measured OE consumption and in using
   foreign LCI databases. The former limitation can be solved by monitoring
   operational performance upon projects completion. This study offers
   practical and detailed reference for LCA practitioners in all countries
   facing the latter challenge, which will persist until integrated
   national LCI databases finally become available. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Many uncertainties arise in system developments since the system became
   complex, large-scale, and deployed in uncertain environment. Developers
   cannot determine some type of uncertainties until start of operation. In
   order to deal with changing requirements and environments caused by
   these uncertainties, we have to tackle with building an architecture
   that takes operations into account in a system development lifecycle. In
   this paper, we propose a lifecycle-oriented development process which
   improve the requirement and design in terms of uncertainties for
   realizing sustainable information architecture for smart mobility. As a
   case study, we apply the proposed method to a development of Patrash
   which is a transfer guide application.},

Abstract = {The governance of blockchain (BC) technology is a topic of continuing
   study, and a multidisciplinary perspective on blockchain governance is
   essential for building a formal governance framework for this emerging
   technology. While there may be some misconceptions surrounding the topic
   of blockchain governance, it is worth noting that blockchain technology
   itself has garnered increasing attention from both academic and business
   communities worldwide. Blockchain stakeholders cannot work or make
   rational decisions optimally without enough insight into the governance
   of blockchains. The element that organisations and end-users must
   consider in their decisions, is the element of regulation for the
   blockchain technology or network, which regulators and developers still
   need to grasp this concept. There is a pressing need for meta-synthesis
   concerning blockchain governance to address the limitations of
   individual studies, generate new insights and understandings, identify
   gaps in the existing research, and keep up with the latest developments
   in this rapidly evolving field. This Meta-synthesis study intends to
   provide a systematic literature review to evaluate the current
   Information Systems (IS) literature in search of evidence of governance
   concerns and frameworks within the blockchain technology environment. In
   this research, literature shall be used to inform the development and
   proposition of the synthesized integrated blockchain governance
   framework model so that there is a common frame of reference for
   researchers and assists practitioners and business managers of companies
   in conducting more organised analyses of blockchain governance. As the
   issue was completely addressed throughout the five-stage assessment, the
   remaining 30 publications were coded using Nvivo software, 42 codes were
   created. Each author contributed to summarising and categorising the
   resultant codes (axial coding). The innovative blockchain governance
   framework proposes four perspectives: Open-Source System (OSS)
   Governance Phases, Open-Source System (OSS) Life Cycle Stages,
   blockchain governance framework dimensions and layers and the
   Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework model. It is one of
   the first research papers in the information systems field to make use
   of a meta-synthesis approach to consolidate the existing qualitative
   research and to systematically come up with a blockchain governance
   framework.},

Pages = {799-802},
Note = {Annual Spring Conference of the GfA/17th Annual Conference of the
   International-Society-for-Occupational-Ergonomics-and-Safety (ISOES),

Abstract = {The globalization of the world economy, constantly rising costs in
   international competition, and ever shorter product life cycles increase
   demands for production planning. At the same time manufacturers have to
   guarantee a high ergonomic quality of the workplaces in the production
   facility.
   Comparatively homogenous applications are available for defining the
   product, using CAD and PDM programs, and for producing it, using ERP-
   and MES systems. The production planner however, uses a large number of
   independent non-interacting software tools. This results in considerable
   overhead, among others for entering the same data more than once, or
   creates problems with interfaces between the programs.
   This is the starting point for the Manufacturing Process Management
   (MPM) concept: MPM provides an integrated working environment for
   production planning.
   At the core is a process database that saves information about
   processing sequences, resources and product. Based on this database are
   different planning tools, that span everything from digital mock-up
   analysis, to defining the production steps, to optimizing the workplaces
   with a human model, to creating documentation. For this, MTM is an
   important building block, as it supports estimating the processing times
   and determining the required capacities at an early stage of planning.
   Furthermore, web-based collaboration tools enable the planner to
   cooperate between several locations and support transferring proven
   production processes to other locations.
   The MTM concept enables companies to accelerate the planning process.
   The integrated change management eases the parallel start of planning
   and product definition, and thus contributes to implement simultaneous
   engineering.
   The concept of a best practice database for processes and resources, as
   well as integrated simulation tools lead to increased production quality
   with low expenditure. It also leads to an improved planning result, thus
   resulting in cost advantage at ramp-up and during production. Ergonomic
   best practices may thus be defined and implemented for the company, as
   well as for the suppliers.},

Title = {Promoting resilient and sustainable food systems: A systematic
   literature review on short food supply chains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {435},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Purpose: This review aims to comprehensively analyze the Short Food
   Supply Chain (SFSC) model, which connects local food producers directly
   with consumers. By exploring participation factors, sustainable
   practices, challenges, economic impacts, and social benefits, this study
   seeks to provide a thorough understanding of SFSCs. Addressing gaps in
   existing research, the review aims to guide policymakers and
   practitioners in fostering sustainable, resilient, and inclusive local
   food systems. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature
   review of 92 research articles was conducted following a well-defined
   research protocol. Findings: The review revealed that factors driving
   the adoption of SFSCs include increasing consumer demand for local and
   sustainable products, resilience-building in the food system, and
   environmental concerns. The SFSC supply chain was categorized into four
   critical stages: food sourcing and production, processing, aggregation,
   and distribution and review examined the sustainable practices at each
   stage. However, challenges such as information asymmetry, lack of
   infrastructure, regulatory barriers, and market dynamics hinder the full
   potential of SFSCs. Economically, SFSCs contribute to local economic
   development and empowerment of small-scale producers, while also showing
   promise in reducing environmental footprints and fostering community
   engagement. Research implications: The study identifies several research
   avenues to further advance the understanding of SFSCs. Future research
   should delve into consumer behavior and attitudes towards SFSCs, analyze
   the full sustainability impacts of SFSCs using integrated assessment
   methodologies, and extend the study to different regional contexts.
   Additionally, investigating policy interventions and governance
   mechanisms that can support the growth and resilience of SFSCs will be
   crucial for promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
   Originality/value: This review contributes to the existing literature by
   providing a comprehensive and systematic overview of SFSCs, addressing
   gaps left by previous review studies. The study's findings offer
   valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders
   seeking to enhance the adoption and support of SFSCs in contemporary
   food systems.},

Title = {Li-Ion Battery Anode State of Charge Estimation and Degradation
   Monitoring Using Battery Casing via Unknown Input Observer},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The anode state of charge (SOC) and degradation information pertaining
   to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for understanding battery
   degradation over time. This information about each cell in a battery
   pack can help prolong the battery pack's life cycle. Because of the
   limited observability, estimating the anode state and capacity fade is
   difficult. This task is even more challenging for the cells in a battery
   pack, as the current through the individual cell is not constant when
   cells are connected in parallel. Considering these challenges, this
   paper presents a novel method to set up three-electrode cells by using
   the battery's casing as a reference electrode for building a
   three-electrode battery pack. This work is a continuation of the
   authors' previous research. An unknown input observer (UIO) is employed
   to estimate the anode SOC of an individual battery in the battery pack.
   To ensure the stability of a defined Lyapunov function, the UIO
   parameter matrices are expressed as a linear matrix inequality (LMI).
   The anode SOC of a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) battery
   is estimated by using the standard graphite potential (SGP) and state of
   lithiation (SOL) characteristic curve. The anode capacity is then
   calculated by using the total charge transferred in a charging cycle and
   the estimated SOC of the anode. The degradation of the battery is then
   evaluated by comparing the capacity fading of the anode to the total
   charge carried to the cell. The proposed method can estimate the anode
   SOC and capacity fade of an individual battery in a battery pack, which
   can monitor the degradation of the individual batteries and the battery
   pack in real time. By using the proposed method, we can identify the
   over-degraded batteries in the pack for remaining useful life analysis
   on the battery.},

Title = {Generative BIM workspace for AEC conceptual design automation: prototype
   development},

Abstract = {Purpose The integration and automation of the whole design and
   implementation process have become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects. Problems of process integration, particularly at the
   conceptual design stage, often manifest through a number of significant
   areas, from design representation, cognition and translation to process
   fragmentation and loss of design integrity. Whilst building information
   modelling (BIM) applications can be used to support design automation,
   particularly through the modelling, amendment and management stages,
   they do not explicitly provide whole design integration. This is a
   significant challenge. However, advances in generative design now offer
   significant potential for enhancing the design experience to mitigate
   this challenge. Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in
   this paper specifically addresses BIM deficiencies at the conceptual
   design stage, where the core drivers and indicators of BIM and
   generative design are identified and mapped into a generative BIM
   (G-BIM) framework and subsequently embedded into a G-BIM prototype. This
   actively engages generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM
   environment to support the early conceptual design process. The
   developed prototype followed the CIFE ``horseshoe{''} methodology of
   aligning theoretical research with scientific methods to procure
   architecture, construction and engineering (AEC)-based solutions. This
   G-BIM prototype was also tested and validated through a focus group
   workshop engaging five AEC domain experts. Findings The G-BIM prototype
   presents a valuable set of rubrics to support the conceptual design
   stage using generative design. It benefits from the advanced features of
   BIM tools in relation to illustration and collaboration (coupled with
   BIM's parametric change management features). Research
   limitations/implications This prototype has been evaluated through
   multiple projects and scenarios. However, additional test data is needed
   to further improve system veracity using conventional and non-standard
   real-life design settings (and contexts). This will be reported in later
   works. Originality/value Originality and value rest with addressing the
   shortcomings of previous research on automation during the design
   process. It also addresses novel computational issues relating to the
   implementation of generative design systems, where, for example, instead
   of engaging static and formal description of the domain concepts, G-BIM

Title = {Ensuring Reliable Operation of Machine Parts with a New System of
   Variable Tolerances},
Journal = {ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-91},
Abstract = {Introduction. The article describes an algorithm for determining the
   system of tolerances for ensuring reliable operation of parts on the
   section. The block diagram of the program for determining the variable
   tolerances is demonstrated. There determined blocks of initial
   information - broken and smooth curves of the controlled parameter,
   histogram and graph of resource distribution and definition of active
   area of control, and blocks of building graphs of ``marginal fan curves
   of wear{''} and systems of admissions for objects of study of two types:
   for universal fuel pump (UTN-5) and four-section small-sized fuel pump
   with mechanical regulator. Two ways of determining the system of
   tolerances are suggested. Variant 1 is a graphical way through
   constructing ``limit fan curves of wear{''} and determining tolerances
   by the value of ordinates in the control points. Variant 2 is an
   analytical way. There is created a formula to replace the graphical
   method for determining system tolerances.
   Materials and Methods. Two models of high-pressure pump were selected as
   objects of the study. Nominal and limit values of parameters were known
   for the pumps. Schedules for checking and equation of wear curves arc
   determined. Dependencies describing the pump plunger pair wear curves
   are determined. A histogram and graph for determining pump life cycles
   are drawn. The active area of control is determined with a given failure
   probability coefficient.
   Results. As a result of the study the values for the tolerances system
   of two types of high pressure fuel pumps are obtained. Reliability
   values for one pump type are determined. Graphic and analytical
   algorithms for determining the system of tolerances by the formula are
   developed.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The study approves the possibility of using
   the variable tolerance as a basis for determining the system of
   tolerances and reliability indicators of the diagnostic object.},

Title = {Collaboration on procurement of e-content between the National Health
   Service and higher education in the UK},
Journal = {INTERLENDING \& DOCUMENT SUPPLY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {164-170},
Abstract = {Purpose - Collaboration on procurement of e-content between health
   libraries in the National Health Service (NHS) and in higher education
   (HE) should have advantages in increasing their negotiating power to
   improve licence terms and avoiding unnecessary duplication of content.
   The aim of the paper is to examine some of the strategies for ensuring
   that collaboration across the two sectors works effectively. The paper
   is based on a report to the Joint Information Systems Committee of the
   Funding Councils (for higher and further education) in the UK, and the
   NHS Library and Knowledge Development Network, on research conducted in
   2006.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methods included interviews (n = 39)
   with representatives from NHS and higher education bodies,
   representatives of independent health libraries, the National Library
   for Health, collective agencies, publishers and aggregators.
   Findings - There were common interests in functionality/interfaces, open
   access, and better metrics for estimating usage that might contribute to
   discussions with publishers over the licence terms. There are
   differences in the type of resource each sector might deem to be core.
   The extent of existing collaboration on purchasing and related
   collection management activities varied considerably across the UK.
   Three possible paths for cooperative activity were identified: sharing
   information and joint advocacy; building the technical infrastructure;
   and joint procurement. Mapping of the stages, roles, actors and
   stakeholders in some processes was done with ``use cases{''} (Unified
   Modeling Language) to help identify some of the risks involved.
   Research limitations/implications - Poor response from online surveys
   limited the validity of the forecasting of user needs. Usage statistics
   were difficult to obtain and compare.
   Practical implications - The paper concludes that collaborative
   procurement of e-content activities should focus on health services
   research requirements, and open access needs across the sectors. More
   innovative analysis of usage statistics is required to profile usage and
   inform cost analyses of both the impact of new roles for health
   librarians, and cost analyses of e-resources on a life cycle basis.
   Originality/value - The paper develops new ways of examining the
   business processes required for collaborative procurement.},

Title = {Improving Applicability for Information Model of an IFC-Based Steel
   Bridge in the Design Phase Using Functional Meanings of Bridge
   Components},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The industry foundation classes (IFC) data model is the most important
   data schema in ensuring the interoperability of the information
   generated throughout the lifecycle of facilities. However, because the
   current IFC model is focused on buildings, there are limitations when
   this model is applied to bridge structures. This paper proposes a method
   that enables the information modeling of steel box girder bridges based
   on the current IFC. To select the required and core items, we classify
   the components of a steel box girder bridge by the design stage with
   reference to engineering documents. To generate functional meanings of
   each bridge component, we develop the rules of the unique identifier and
   information reassignment, and then apply a semi-automated naming
   algorithm. The generated bridge information model was used to confirm
   the functional semantic meanings of individual components, and it was
   checked whether additional external information, such as carbon
   emissions, could be linked for specific bridge components. It was
   observed that information retrieval and extraction for components is
   possible through a semantic-based query to the generated IFC-based
   bridge information model.},

   approach with critical chain method and 5D simulation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 12},
Abstract = {This article introduces a project management method for historical
   building groups using BIM technology. Historical building group projects
   encompass the entire lifecycle, from design, repair and reconstruction
   to construction and maintenance. To efficiently manage these complex
   endeavors, the Critical Chain Method is employed to control project
   progress, enabling effective coordination between various project
   aspects and reducing project duration. By leveraging the BIM 5D
   platform, the article incorporates schedules, site layouts and bidding
   quotations to simulate the construction processes involved in historical
   building projects. This comprehensive approach facilitates real-time
   project management, supported by video documentation and virtual
   walkthroughs. The utilization of BIM technology in this context allows
   for the successful realization of project management objectives for
   historical building groups. The article's methodology aims to address
   the specific challenges associated with historical building group
   projects, enhancing their overall efficiency, cost-effectiveness and
   coordination among various stakeholders.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-51},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {It is now globally accepted that human activity has caused rapid climate
   change, and the built environment is one of the biggest contributors to
   carbon emissions worldwide. There are primarily two ways in which the
   built environment generates carbon emissions: from energy used during
   operation (operational carbon) and from the materials used for building
   and maintenance (embodied carbon). While the industry is increasingly
   interrogating operational carbon, embodied carbon has historically been
   less understood.
   In 2012, Hawkins\textbackslash{}Brown and the University College London
   Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering agreed to co-fund a
   doctoral project seeking to improve the visualisation of embodied carbon
   and its impact on the whole life carbon (WLC) of a project. One output
   of this research was the Hawkins Brown Emissions Reduction Tool
   (H\textbackslash{}B:ERT), a BIM-based tool for rapid reporting and
   visualisation of embodied carbon in buildings. This paper outlines the
   tool's development and initial lessons learned from its use at
   Hawkins\textbackslash{}Brown.
   H\textbackslash{}B:ERT v1 measures embodied carbon. As it is available
   for free from the Hawkins\textbackslash{}Brown website, it has
   contributed to the rapid rise in discussion and dissemination of
   information about embodied carbon and the contribution it plays in
   overall emissions. Version 2, which additionally measures WLC, has been
   fully integrated into the Hawkins\textbackslash{}Brown design and BIM
   processes allowing consideration of WLC emissions from the earliest
   design stages alongside more traditional design drivers. The paper
   concludes by outlining how the tool can develop and what regulatory
   frameworks are required to ensure WLC decision-making becomes the
   standard method of approaching building and infrastructure design.},

Abstract = {Earthquakes are a sudden natural disaster that seriously endangers the
   safety of people's lives and property. Rapid and accurate assessment of
   earthquake disasters, especially the building damage assessment, is an
   effective way to reduce the risk of disasters. Compared with traditional
   methods of GIS-based building damage assessment, which takes the entire
   stricken region as a whole assessment area, lacks in considering the
   uneven space-time distribution of damage factors, the seismic spatial
   information grid (SSIG) method fully considers the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of seismic data and can give a more accurate and
   detailed assessment results. SSIG is an earthquake thematic spatial
   information grid, which has integrated numerous kinds of spatial
   information technology. In this paper, SSIG has been introduced into
   building damage assessments. It describes the model and method of
   building damage assessment based on SSIG. The proposed method was
   exemplified after the Yushu earthquake in Qinghai province of China. The
   case application shows that the SSIG-based method can get more accurate
   assessment results than single GIS-based method.},

Abstract = {Customization, enhanced quality of streamlined maintenance services and
   uplifted productivity are some of the key highlights from the rapidly
   evolving concept of Industry 4.0. IoT (Internet of things) based service
   infrastructure models designed for delivering enterprise services with
   capabilities of pro-actively sensing malfunctions and responding with
   preventive measures to streamline the automated service offered is one
   of the prime application of this concept. Continuous maintenance
   services increase the optimum through-life cost and in-service life
   cycle of the product providing the customer with the feel of full
   ownership. In-service feedbacks also help the manufactures to identify
   issues with respect to the designs and improve it in the future
   versions. In this paper, as a proof of concept a cloud-based IoT service
   infrastructure for providing real-time prognostic and supervised vehicle
   maintenance system is proposed. This proposed system aims at providing
   an enterprise service infrastructure to the registered vehicle service
   centers to keep track of the real-time vehicle diagnostic information of
   their client's vehicle over cloud and use prognostic algorithms to
   identify any malfunctions or abnormal behavior of the vehicles for
   automatically scheduling a service appointment and automating the
   maintenance cycle of the vehicle. In addition to this, the system
   provides features like remote supervision and diagnostics maintenance
   enabling technicians to fix issues remotely, ensuring streamlined and
   reliable service. Initially, before building the proposed prototype
   system, a few experimental trails where conducted for analyzing the use
   of different IoT models used in the development to identify the
   best-suited approach. The results indicated that the
   publisher-subscriber (NodeJS) based model outperforms the
   request-response (PHP) based model in terms of the hits per second and
   mean request time for an increased number of active users. The results
   of the initial tests justify the reason for the using the
   publisher-subscriber based IOT architecture. The conceptualized
   enterprise infrastructure illustrated in the manuscript aims at
   providing a streamlined maintenance service.},

Title = {PDON: Parkinson's disease ontology for representation and modeling of
   the Parkinson's disease knowledge domain},
Journal = {THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the unprecedented and increasing amount of data,
   relatively little progress has been made in molecular characterization
   of mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease. In the area of Parkinson's
   research, there is a pressing need to integrate various pieces of
   information into a meaningful context of presumed disease mechanism(s).
   Disease ontologies provide a novel means for organizing, integrating,
   and standardizing the knowledge domains specific to disease in a
   compact, formalized and computer-readable form and serve as a reference
   for knowledge exchange or systems modeling of disease mechanism.
   Methods: The Parkinson's disease ontology was built according to the
   life cycle of ontology building. Structural, functional, and expert
   evaluation of the ontology was performed to ensure the quality and
   usability of the ontology. A novelty metric has been introduced to
   measure the gain of new knowledge using the ontology. Finally, a
   cause-and-effect model was built around PINK1 and two gene expression
   studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were re-annotated to
   demonstrate the usability of the ontology.
   Results: The Parkinson's disease ontology with a subclass-based
   taxonomic hierarchy covers the broad spectrum of major biomedical
   concepts from molecular to clinical features of the disease, and also
   reflects different views on disease features held by molecular
   biologists, clinicians and drug developers. The current version of the
   ontology contains 632 concepts, which are organized under nine views.
   The structural evaluation showed the balanced dispersion of concept
   classes throughout the ontology. The functional evaluation demonstrated
   that the ontology-driven literature search could gain novel knowledge
   not present in the reference Parkinson's knowledge map. The ontology was
   able to answer specific questions related to Parkinson's when evaluated
   by experts. Finally, the added value of the Parkinson's disease ontology
   is demonstrated by ontology-driven modeling of PINK1 and re-annotation
   of gene expression datasets relevant to Parkinson's disease.
   Conclusions: Parkinson's disease ontology delivers the knowledge domain
   of Parkinson's disease in a compact, computer-readable form, which can
   be further edited and enriched by the scientific community and also to
   be used to construct, represent and automatically extend
   Parkinson's-related computable models. A practical version of the
   Parkinson's disease ontology for browsing and editing can be publicly
   accessed at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PDON.},

Abstract = {The motivation of this paper is to examine and review the current study,
   gaps and trends in commissioning process and documentation in the
   architectural, engineering, construction, operation, and facility
   management (AECO-FM) industry and to propose future directions for
   imminent research area to revolutionized commissioning documentation in
   AECO-FM industry. In this paper, 66 research papers are studied to
   narrate the evolution of the commissioning process and documentation.
   This study discussed the current approach and studied adopted by the
   various retrieved research papers. Followed by identification of
   research gaps associated with on-going commissioning process and
   documentation. It has been found that limited studies focus on effective
   and automated building information sharing during commissioning and
   closeout stage for efficient building handover and O\&M through its
   lifecycle. The automated digital practices to perform commissioning and
   handover process are still largely unknown. This study proposes novel
   approach for building information sharing through digital commissioning
   process. A scenario is presented to illustrate the application of
   digital commissioning process for building information sharing and
   verification of building assets. The proposed approach shows automatic
   and real-time information sharing with a holistic approach to perform
   building commissioning.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The notions of smart construction and smart or digital cities include
   many modern concepts that are advocated today, especially in countries
   with advanced economies, and depend on using information technology and
   the Internet of Things as a basis to automate processes and activate
   digital systems to manage activities and services related to the
   operation of buildings and urban structures. In light of the spread of
   digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a
   digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and
   direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and
   technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual
   representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously
   by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and
   actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning,
   simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to
   review the literature on construction project management through the
   lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve
   operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and
   supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main
   stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM);
   the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned
   third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex
   visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to
   exact change within a construction project on the building site.},

Abstract = {Digitalization, enhancing operational performance and promoting
   data-driven practices, is gaining prominence globally. However, its
   adoption in the construction industry, particularly in developing
   countries like India, is still in its infancy. This study explores the
   role and impact of digital twins, a key component of digital
   transformation, in the Indian construction sector. A cross-sectional
   study was conducted using qualitative and quantitative methods,
   collecting data from various roles within organizations primarily
   engaged in building information modeling. The aim is to understand the
   feasibility, acceptability, and adaptability of digital twins in the
   construction sector. Results indicate that identified factors positively
   influence these constructs. Despite a preference for human intervention,
   the study predicts significant traction for automated methods in the
   Indian construction sector. The survey factors strongly influence the
   feasibility, acceptability, and adaptability of digital twins in Indian
   construction organizations, demonstrating the potential to adapt and
   incorporate innovative technologies throughout the project lifecycle.
   Despite risks and challenges, Indian construction firms can adopt
   digital twins in projects.},

Abstract = {The methodology concept of building parametric series of unified
   building products is presented. The purpose of the work is to create a
   method that would enable consideration of environmental safety
   requirements at the stage of design of the size range of the building
   products line. Method simplicity is based on the assumption of linear
   correlation of building products use parameters and required
   environmental parameters. Existing lifecycle assessment methods are
   intended for the analysis of one-off products rather than a set (line)
   of similar unified products. The problem is that the known product
   lifecycle assessment methods and line product configuration management
   methods yield mutually exclusive results. This work proposes the data
   presentation method that combines graphic construction of a parametric
   series of unified products and graphic construction of environmental
   requirements to products and their manufacturing and operation
   techniques. The work uses the known map imposition method as an
   environmental assessment method. Imposing a layer with graphic
   information about interrelated design and operational parameters of a
   product on a layer of information on acceptable exposure of these
   products manufacture and operation processes helps the product designer
   choose parameters of the unified product that meet environmental
   requirements from a host of options.},

Abstract = {Over the past years, a growing trend of utilizing camera-equipped drones
   for periodical building facade inspection has emerged. Building facade
   anomalies, such as cracks and erosion, can be detected through analyzing
   drone-captured video, photographs, and infrared images. Such anomalies
   are known to have an impact on various building performance aspects, e.
   g., thermal, energy, moisture control issues. Current research efforts
   mainly focus on computational image processing methods to recognize
   certain types of facade anomalies. However, there is a lack of research
   on mapping detected anomalies into the building model and managing
   lifecycle inspection information. This paper aims to propose a
   systematic process for detecting and managing building facade anomalies
   based on drone-collected images. An overall data structure, data flow,
   and related processing techniques within this systematic process are
   defined. The proposed systematic process will support the facade anomaly
   detection and building maintenance decision-making.},

Abstract = {One of the foci of the telecommunications industry is improving the time
   to market for new products and services. This requires fundamental
   advances in building management systems. Currently, these systems are
   built in a ``stovepipe{''} fashion. This causes three important
   problems: (1) the lack of a common means to represent and reuse
   management information, (2) the lack of a standard set of policies and
   processes to architect their management systems, and (3) the lack of a
   standard architecture that can facilitate the introduction of COTS
   components.
   The TMF is making good strides in solving some of these problems.
   However, a critical element is defining a model of the lifecycle of
   components and solutions. This will provide a unifying methodology for
   facilitating the creation and development of a next generation solution.
   This paper will discuss the business needs and technical foundation of
   the DEN-ng and NGOSS Lifecycle models, and show how they can be used to
   guide the development of NGOSS solutions.},

Abstract = {The methodology concept of building parametric series of unified
   building products is presented. The purpose of the work is to create a
   method that would enable consideration of environmental safety
   requirements at the stage of design of the size range of the building
   products line. Method simplicity is based on the assumption of linear
   correlation of building products use parameters and required
   environmental parameters. Existing lifecycle assessment methods are
   intended for the analysis of one-off products rather than a set (line)
   of similar unified products. The problem is that the known product
   lifecycle assessment methods and line product configuration management
   methods yield mutually exclusive results. This work proposes the data
   presentation method that combines graphic construction of a parametric
   series of unified products and graphic construction of environmental
   requirements to products and their manufacturing and operation
   techniques. The work uses the known map imposition method as an
   environmental assessment method. Imposing a layer with graphic
   information about interrelated design and operational parameters of a
   product on a layer of information on acceptable exposure of these
   products manufacture and operation processes helps the product designer
   choose parameters of the unified product that meet environmental
   requirements from a host of options.},

Abstract = {Logistic processes of construction sites are transferred into virtual
   and full 3D environments to increase the interoperability for all
   project partners. These digital twins are emerging for the construction
   process of modern building processes and are already designed to be used
   for the operation of the building afterwards. In structural health
   monitoring (SHM) the sensor installations are also designed to monitor
   the structure over its whole lifespan. Therefore, the embedding process
   and the operation of the sensor systems and the Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) have overlapping long-term goals. Beside these 3D
   software advances in civil engineering, the working environments in the
   field of geodesy still follow more established approaches. In many cases
   using only 2D CAD plans and on-site visits at the existing structure are
   best practice for the design of geodetic monitoring installations. This
   paper describes the improvement of the concept creation of permanent
   monitoring systems with geodetic total stations in an interactive
   virtual 3D environment. The simulated instruments are behaving according
   to their specification data and are linked with a physics engine to
   automatically detect common problems in a network design like obstructed
   line of sights, disadvantageous incidence angles at the targets or
   automatic aiming issues due to multiple targets in the field of view.
   Furthermore, the Virtual Reality (VR) technology is introduced as a user
   interface for a virtual 3D planning environment. The functionality of
   the developed VR application is tested in a real-life use case for the
   feasibility study of the automatic monitoring of a railway tunnel.},

Abstract = {Buidling under heavy weather is seldom beneficial, but common practice
   on site. It promotes inaccuracies and impairs the use of modern but
   sensible high-performance materials and costs time, since disruption in
   construction frequently causes complicated returns to the planning
   process Nevertheless, a handcrafted production process is still
   considered the one and only alternative since all buildings are unique
   and thus must be manually constructed on site. Indeed? The priority
   program entitled ``Adaptive modularised constructions made in a flux{''}
   funded by the German Research Foundation follows a completely new
   approach. Buildings are divided into similar modular precast concrete
   elements, prefabricated in flow production, quality assured, and
   just-in-time assembled on site Comparable to puzzles with many pieces,
   the uniqueness of the structure is maintained. The motto is:
   ``Individuality on a large scale - similarity on a small scale{''} The
   contribution presents approaches of modularisation, production concepts,
   and linking digital models. Serial, stationary prefabrication enables
   short production times and resource-efficient modules that are assembled
   to load-bearing structures with low geometrical deviations Stringent
   digitalisation ensures high quality of all im termediate steps. These
   comprise fabrication, assembly, and the whole service life of the
   structure. The result is a lean production process.},

Abstract = {We are reporting on our experience in building and deploying OWL
   ontologies from within a newly introduced PSU ontology repository (POR)
   into a number of application software. These ontologies are also exposed
   to public outsiders to edit and extend (Open) and allow access to
   similar Internet ontologies using public ontology search engines such as
   SWOOGLE and IBM WATSON. This environment is mainly used to empower
   software application developers with semantics (analogues to Semantic
   Web) to limit development complexity, provide knowledge management, and
   organize software project information. OWL ontologies are machine
   readable; they can be incorporated into the software application
   development as accessible knowledge base shared resources which parts of
   the software can access as needed knowledge units via regular protege
   programming interfaces: Script Tab, and Java API. These shared resources
   reduce development complexity, and promote re-use through linking
   similar and cross domains ontologies. We have been using and testing
   them within software applications to model certain artifacts (such as
   context and profile management, Internet of Things, sensor networks,
   cinema production, and risk and security management components) during
   the application software development life cycle. In this paper we report
   on our experience with each of these software applications: their
   artifacts ontology structure, representation and engineering, validation
   and verification, development and testing, and ontology querying and
   usage. We introduce a new framework of mixing ``ontology engineering and
   access{''} with ``application software development environment{''}. In
   order to measure the gains achieved through this proposed framework, we
   ran a ``Questionnaire{''} among developers to evaluate - What are the
   benefits gained of mixing ``Ontology Engineering and Access{''} with
   ``Application Software Development Environments{''}? - Is the
   ``Framework{''} presented perceived useful by developers? - Are the
   ``Consolidated Customized{''} ontologies constructed using the framework
   better, in some modeling quality sense, than the ontologies constructed
   without the framework? - Are the tasks given to developers done faster
   when using the framework? - How do developers use the framework
   provided, and what support would be beneficial? Subjective opinions show
   that 2/3 of developers perceive the framework as useful or very useful.
   We found out that developers feel that they have constructed better
   quality ontologies and that they are ``guided{''} by the framework. As
   such the main purpose of the open POR to facilitate inhouse and
   out-of-house resources for building consolidated customized ontologies
   has been fulfilled.},

Title = {Stakeholders ` power over the impact issues of building energy
   performance gap: A two-mode social network analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Energy-related stakeholders play a critical role in energy-saving and
   emission reduction. However, most previous studies focused on only a few
   stakeholders (e.g., occupant, designer and owner). Therefore, there is a
   lack of systematic analysis of energy-related stakeholders. Improving
   building energy efficiency requires the collaboration of all
   stakeholders in the building lifecycle. This study applies a two-mode
   social network model to investigate the stakeholders' power over the
   impact issues of building energy efficiency. Results show that all
   issues can be addressed by at least two stakeholders, thereby indicating
   the potential of collaboration in building energy management. Designers,
   manufacturers, commissioning agents and researchers are the most
   influential stakeholders with the highest degree centrality, betweenness
   centrality and eigenvector centrality. Insufficient knowledge and
   experience, lack of information integrity and unclear responsibility are
   the most influential impact issues. With the density of interaction
   being 1.000, nine core stakeholders (i.e. owner, designer, contractor,
   subcontractor, supervisor, manufacturer, commissioning agent, energy
   manager and researcher) and four core issues (i.e. unclear
   responsibility, poor collaboration and communication, insufficient
   knowledge and experience, and lack of information integrity) have
   intensive relationships. The core stakeholders account for 75\% of the
   total stakeholders, whereas the core issues account for 25\% of the
   total issues. Moreover, five strategies that are useful in promoting
   collaboration are proposed and validated. After the proposed strategies
   are implemented, the density of the collaboration network increased from
   1.242 to 2.652. This study is not only expected to help researchers in
   understanding the complex interrelationships between stakeholders and
   issues but also practitioners in promoting effective collaboration
   strategies.

Title = {APPROACHES TO MODELLING MARKETING STRATEGIES IN E-COMMERCE},
Journal = {ECONOMICS ECOLOGY SOCIUM},

Volume = {8},

Pages = {67-77},
Abstract = {Introduction. . Increasing the efficiency of business activities
   requires developing a marketing strategy using ecommerce to attract a
   wide range of customers and maximise the company's income. The key
   marketing metric for most companies is the customer lifetime value
   indicator, which is why studying approaches to forecasting this
   indicator in e-commerce requires special attention, considering the
   changing business operation environment. Aim and tasks. . The study aims
   to develop approaches to modelling the marketing strategy of e-commerce
   enterprises. The tasks are a comparative characterisation of modern
   marketing planning tools and an empirical analysis of the possibilities
   of using the BG/NBD model for marketing planning in e-commerce
   companies, considering the need to implement scenario marketing planning
   in unstable conditions. Results. . A comparison of the characteristics
   of the main marketing planning tools was conducted according to features
   such as content and focus, functional purpose, and planning period,
   which allows more purposeful use of these tools to solve specific tasks.
   In order to automatically obtain the required data format for modelling,
   a Visual Basic program was developed, a forecast of customer behaviour
   was built, and an indicator of customer transactions was determined for
   further calculation of customer lifetime value (CLV). During the
   simulation, four parameters of the BG/NBD model were evaluated, and the
   maximum value of the logarithmic likelihood function equal to 14460.54
   was obtained. The expected number of transactions (forecast time = 26
   weeks) was determined for each client from the database. After
   calculations the information was received, the selected client will make
   2.35 transactions during the forecast period of 55-80 weeks. The
   recommended algorithm for using the BG/NBD model as part of a scenario
   approach for forecasting the cost of the customer's life cycle allows
   for more flexible forecasting of digital business revenues and building
   an optimal marketing strategy. Conclusions. . An empirical study of the
   possibilities of using the BG/NBD model for marketing planning in
   e-commerce companies showed that, for the simulation of indicators that
   affect a company's marketing strategy, it is crucial at the initial
   stage to convert the database of customer purchases into the input
   format required for modelling. Using a scenario approach allows
   e-commerce enterprises to carry out variable marketing planning and
   reduce risks under growing uncertainty. A well-designed marketing
   strategy that can be adapted to different business development scenarios
   enables an e-commerce company to increase its sales.},

Abstract = {Data lifecycle models are used to visualize the stages data resources
   pass through from creation to completion of a research project and
   beyond. Although helpful, these models tend to depict idealized and
   impersonal circumstances that often involve curation actions taken by
   researchers themselves, while neglecting to represent dynamics
   particular to researchers' lives and careers. Meanwhile, research data
   are still infrequently managed successfully according to these models,
   which is a particular concern for ``long tail{''} data, where sharing
   tends to depend on individual researchers' decisions and preservation
   actions. The paper addresses these considerations by exploring the ways
   in which long tail data lifecycles are entwined with human career
   lifecycles. Through interviews with astronomers, six affective
   dimensions that may impact data and career lifecycle dynamics are
   identified: painstakingness, loose ends, altruism, intellectual passion,
   legacy, and nostalgia. Building upon these insights and holistically
   drawing connections between human information behavior and data
   lifecycle modeling literature and frameworks, a researcher-centered
   lifecycle model is proposed that seeks to depict the unique motivations
   and changing needs of researchers to share data throughout the courses
   of their careers. The paper concludes with suggestions for theoretical
   development and curatorial interventions in current data lifecycle
   modeling and data management practice.},

Abstract = {The Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China is a highly active morphodynamic
   environment subjected to both climatic driven naturally variations and
   anthropogenic stresses and other modes of transitions. The Yellow River
   changes its channel course within the delta region at a very rapid rate
   with an average channel life-cycle of 10 years. One of the Yellow
   River's unique features consists of its high suspended sediment
   concentration (SSC), which amounts to 25 kg/m(3) on average but may
   exceed 45 g/l in the lower reaches during high discharge periods. In the
   period of industrial human activity in the delta, the path of the river
   is artificially controlled by river training. The fast growing city of
   Dongying with 2 million inhabitants tabs the Yellow River for its water
   resources. Likewise, water demands stemming from local agri- and
   aquaculture productions utilize the river as source of water and arable
   soil. Within this complex and highly dynamic framework the joint Delta
   Information System for Geoenvironmental and Human Habitat Transition (
   DELIGHT, http://www.delight.eoc.dlr.de/en) research project, aims at
   building a comprehensive delta development tool and decision system.
   Numerical models are set up in order to investigate the hydro-and
   morphodynamic situation of the Yellow River Delta. In October 2013, a
   field campaign was undertaken, conducting vessel-based in-situ
   measurements of: water depth profiles and bottom sediment composition
   utilizing a parametric sub-bottom profiler, 3D-current velocities by
   Acoustic-Doppler-Current-Profiler, conductivity, temperature, depth,
   oxygen saturation, pH and turbidity by CTD-probe, fluid densities by
   supersonic density probe and point velocities by electromagnetic current
   meter. Supplementary water and sediment samples have been collected.
   Measurements presented are processed for further usage as calibration
   data for a three dimensional hydro-morphodynamic numerical model
   covering the YRD and the adjacent Bohai Sea. Another field campaign is
   currently being planned for mid-2015 in order to obtain validation data.},

Abstract = {Embedded systems are becoming ubiquitous and taking more and more
   important part in our daily life. Increasingly complex functionality
   leads to higher develop cost and lower software quality. Model checking
   has the potential of alleviating these problems. In this paper, we
   present an approach to construct model directly from the source code. An
   embedded system design language, Virgil, is selected as the target.
   Without losing any information, the UPPAAL model is generated based on
   the typed intermediate language. The timing information and stack
   behavior are estimated and after merging the hardware platform model,
   the whole system can be simulated on the model checker and some safety
   and aliveness properties of the program are verified.},

Abstract = {Enterprise Architecture is now widely recognized as a central discipline
   for managing and governing the evolution of an organization, in
   particular from an Information System perspective. EA models are
   relevant techniques with associated tools for mastering and reasoning
   about the complexity of organizations.
   In the construction domain, architectural models are used for a long
   time and support building architects for managing complex constructions
   projects and their associated building lifecycles.
   In this position paper, we suggest how the two types of model can nicely
   complement. In the specific context of ``smart buildings{''} where the
   `hard' construction component is more and more intertwined with a `soft'
   IS/IT component, we discuss and illustrate some needs regarding the
   benefits associated to the reconciliation of the two types of models.
   For a building architect, we explain how an EA model can complement a
   traditional architectural plan and allow to consider an enlarged
   perspective associated to a ``Building as a service{''} paradigm. For an
   EA architect, there are also situations where there is a need to
   consider both the physical and the digital dimensions of an
   organization. As an illustration of this, we will discuss the security
   risk management domain where risks have to be handled according to a
   systemic perspective.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the Research Center for Automatic Control (CRAN) proposed the
   concept of ``communicating materials{''}, which led to this current
   project. Indeed, 3 French laboratories (the CRAN, LAAS and LIB)
   associated with one company (360SmartConnect/FINAO SAS) are working in
   the framework of the McBIM project to design a ``communicating
   concrete{''}, made of concrete equipped with embedded low-energy
   wireless micro-sensors. This paper briefly describes the context of the
   McBIM project with the main research goal and objectives and then focus
   on the results in the different parts of the project regarding the
   different research issues, explored by the project. Copyright (c) 2022

Abstract = {A strategy for sustainable development is a significant milestone on the
   road to a more socially, economically and environmentally responsible
   society. It creates a framework within which the stakeholders can make a
   strong contribution to a better future. Because of the merits and
   growing interest in sustainable development, the race is on for
   researchers and stakeholders in the construction sector to initiate
   actions to reduce the negative impacts of development and sharpen their
   competitive edge. The cities should be created with a vision which
   supports harmonious communities and living conditions through
   sustainable urban development. The resources must be used efficiently
   while reducing the development impact on human health and environment
   during the buildings' life cycle. Environmental auditing and
   pressure-state response based models to monitor sustainable development
   in Malaysia should be developed. A data availability and sharing system
   should be developed and implemented to facilitate for the use in the
   establishment of sustainable development and low carbon society. Ideas
   which affect millions of people and guide the policies of nations must
   be accessible to all. Only thus can they permeate the institutions from
   the local to the global level. Creating sustainable development and low
   carbon societies depends on the knowledge and involvement of all
   stakeholders in the industry. So what is our level of understanding of
   GIS and its application? The development of geospatial data in Malaysia
   is important because the successful implementation of sustainable
   development and low carbon projects depend largely on the availability
   of geospatial information. It would facilitate the stakeholders and
   resolve some of the problems regarding the availability, quality,
   organisation, accessibility and sharing of spatial information. The
   introduction of GIS may change the way for better sustainable urban
   development and low carbon society performance. The use of GIS is to
   improve decision making to implement development methods, awareness for
   the need for sustainable development and in development control to
   provide the information on the distance from the proclaimed objective.
   Malaysia should not fall in its attitude on sustainable development,
   green design, sustainable construction and a low carbon society.
   Literature review on GIS is carried out to understand the philosophy,
   concept, principles, challenges and advantages of using GIS for
   sustainable urban development and low carbon societies. This paper would
   encourage our understanding about the state of geographical information
   system (GIS) in sustainable development and its application which would
   further stimulate actions and strategies towards a sustainable built
   environment.},

Abstract = {In today's e-Business environment, ERP, CRM, collaboration tools, and
   networked sensors may be characterized as data generators resources.
   Business Intelligence (BI) is a term that incorporates a range of
   analytical and decision support applications in business including data
   mining, decision support systems, knowledge management systems, and
   online analytical processing; processing data within these systems
   produce new data that are characterized to grow rapidly causing
   limitation problem of data management if handled by a Relational
   Database Management System (RDBMS) or statistical tools. Collectively
   these structured and unstructured data are referred to as Big Data.
   Successful and efficient handling of Big Data requires deployment of
   specific IT infrastructure components as well as adopting an emerging
   service model. In this research we introduce a conceptual model that
   abstracts the processing scheme of big data processing lifecycle. The
   model addresses the main phases of the lifecycle: data acquisition, data
   serialization, data aggregation, data analysis, data mining, knowledge
   representation, and information dissemination. The model is driven by
   projecting Service Oriented Architecture attributes to the building
   block of the lifecycle and adhering to the Lifecycle Modeling Language
   specification.},

Title = {Few-shot learning for structural health diagnosis of civil
   infrastructure},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Number = {A},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The successful development of deep learning and computer vision
   techniques has recently revolutionized structural health diagnosis (SHD)
   during life-cycle construction, inspection, maintenance, and disaster
   prevention for civil infrastructure. Multi-source big data of structural
   health monitoring (SHM) and inspection are projected into a high-level
   feature space, and data-driven models are established to map the
   relationships between inputs and outputs and dig out embedded structural
   behaviors and implicit physical mechanisms. However, the model
   performance highly relies on the extensive amount and diversity,
   intra-class completeness, and inter-class balance of training data, and
   the generalization ability on scarce data with specific features and
   particular patterns is challenging under real-world scenarios. To
   address the above challenges, few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a
   cutting-edge machine learning technique that designs training strategies
   using only a small amount of annotated data under a limited supervision
   regime to enhance effectiveness and generalization ability. This article
   systematically summarizes recent advances in FSL algorithms and the
   corresponding applications in SHD for civil infrastructure. A unified
   mathematical framework of FSL is formulated, and an FSL taxonomy is
   summarized according to intrinsic learning mechanisms and implementation
   principles, including metric learning-based, optimization-based,
   transfer learning-based, and generative model-based methods. Various
   applications of SHD for civil infrastructure under real-world scenarios
   are reviewed, including remote sensing monitoring, structural damage
   recognition, post-disaster safety evaluation, and construction risk
   assessment. Error analyses of approximation, generalization, and
   optimization errors corresponding to the four paradigms mentioned above
   are formulated for FSL-based data-driven modeling, which exactly acts as
   the logical connection with how new thoughts of FSL-based SHD should be
   designed. Finally, potential prospects of FSLbased SHD are outlined to
   design weakly supervised FSL considering low-quality data from SHM
   systems, develop multi-modal FSL for multi-source SHM data, establish
   cross-task FSL with high commonality and generality for various SHD
   tasks, and construct lightweight FSL framework with model compression
   for real-world applications of SHD considering the super-large stream of
   monitoring data.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With increasing interest in automatic and intelligent systems to enhance
   the building and construction industry, digital twins (DT) are gaining
   popularity as cost-effective solutions to meet stakeholder requirements.
   Comprising real-time multi-asset connectivity, simulation, and decision
   support functionalities, many recent studies have utilised Industry 4.0
   technologies with DT systems to fulfil construction-specific
   applications. However, there is no comprehensive review to our
   knowledge, holistically examining the benefits of using DT as a platform
   from the angles of Industry 4.0 technologies, project management, and
   building lifecycle. To bridge this gap, a systematic literature review
   of 182 papers on DT-in-construction works over the past 6 years is
   conducted to address the three perspectives. In this review, a unified
   framework is first modelled to incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies
   within the DT structure. Next, a Six M methodology (comprising of
   Machine, Manpower, Material, Measurement, Milieu, and Method) based on
   Ishikawa's Diagram with building lifecycle considerations is proposed to
   highlight the advantages of DT in ensuring successful construction
   projects. Lastly, through the identification of 11 future directions,
   this work aims to serve as a reference for both industry and academia
   towards the use of DT systems as a fundamental enabler to realise the
   Construction 4.0 paradigm.},

Title = {Digital approaches to construction compliance checking: Validating the
   suitability of an ecosystem approach to compliance checking},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The lifecycle of the built environment is governed by complex
   regulations, requirements and standards. Ensuring compliance against
   these requirements is a complicated process, affecting the entire supply
   chain and often incurring significant costs, delay and uncertainty. Many
   of the processes, and elements within these processes, are formalised
   and supported by varying levels of digitisation and automation. This
   ranges from energy simulation, geometric checking, to building
   information modelling based checking. However, there are currently no
   unifying standards or integrating technology to tie regulatory efforts
   together to enable the widespread adoption of automated compliance
   processes. This has left many current technical approaches, while
   advanced and robust, isolated. However, the increasing maturity of asset
   datasets/information models, means that integration of data/tools is now
   feasible. This paper will propose and validate a new approach of solving
   the problem of automated compliance checking through the use of an
   ecosystem of compliance checking services. This work has identified a
   clear research gap. How automated compliance checking in the
   construction sector can move beyond sole reliance on BIM data, and
   tightly coupled integration with software tools, to provide an
   extensible enough system to integrate the current isolated software
   elements currently used within compliance checking processes. To test
   this approach, an architecture for an ecosystem of compliance services
   will be specified. To validate this architecture, a prototype version
   will be developed and validated against requirements derived from the
   weaknesses of current approaches. This validation has found that a
   distributed ecosystem can perform accurately and successfully, whilst
   providing advantages in terms of scalability and extensibility. This
   approach provides a route to the increased adoption of automated
   compliance checking, overcoming the issues of relying on one computer
   system/application to perform all aspects of this process.},

Abstract = {The main objective of sustainable buildings is to reduce the depletion
   of energy, water, and materials caused by facilities during the
   lifecycle of a building. In 2012, the electric consumption of the U. S.
   commercial sector, including institutional buildings and public roads
   lighting, was about 274 kWh. That is about seven percent of total U. S.
   electricity consumption per year. Specifically, lighting is considered a
   major energy consumer in the commercial buildings. Nevertheless, most of
   the research has neglected the occupants' behavioral factors that
   influence occupants' usage of artificial lighting. To assess the
   behavior of occupants in commercial buildings, the current research
   considers the effect of environmental, physical, and policy-related
   factors on daylighting intensity in workplaces in institutional
   buildings. An occupant performance assessment model, using the analytic
   hierarchy process (AHP), is developed in order to investigate the
   influence of preferred lighting factors on daylighting intensity in
   office spaces. The data is collected from different institutional
   buildings using a Delphi technique. In addition, the model has been
   validated with 88.26\% average validity percent (AVP). The main
   objective of the developed model is to benefit both architects and
   practitioners as they choose appropriate workplace designs related to
   the occupants' preferences for enhancing energy efficiency. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Current building energy use is projected to increase by 1.7\% annually
   until 2025, and the great potential for energy reduction in existing
   buildings has created opportunities in building energy retrofit
   projects. In this research, a framework and method are proposed to
   evaluate the impacts of different retrofit options to existing building
   under climate change. A Python retrofit tool is developed to perform
   parametric study by running EnergyPlus under different retrofit
   scenarios for existing buildings. With the help of Latin-hypercube
   sampling (LHS) method and a joint mutual information maximization
   (JMIM)-based feature selection method, the energy conservation measure
   (ECM) that may have the most potential in reducing the energy use or the
   lifecycle net present value (NPV) of a target existing building can be
   selected. A validated data-driven model is used to predict the
   building's future hourly energy use based on EnergyPlus simulation
   results generated by future extreme year weather data. It is
   demonstrated that global climate change will alter the optimal solution
   of future ECM combination and its influence varies from building to
   building, location to location. The optimal retrofit strategy of
   selecting the best ECM combinations under current climate condition will
   be subject to change in the future climate condition.},

Title = {FROM DESIGN TO PRE-CERTIFICATION USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {151-176},
Abstract = {Designs which address sustainability requirements are becoming
   increasingly desirable, as the objectives of sustainable design reduce
   resource depletion of energy, water, and raw materials; prevent
   environmental degradation caused throughout their lifecycle; provide
   safe, comfortable and healthy living environments. Currently,
   sustainability in the building domain is judged against standards
   codified in rating systems. That is, design choices are validated, by
   measuring design performance against criteria specified by the rating
   system. Advances in building technologies, design and evaluation tools,
   and government policies together with tools to benchmark sustainability
   have created the momentum which fuels an increasing trend towards
   sustainable building design. However, certification is expensive. It is
   labor intensive, involving large volumes of data aggregation and
   information accounting, which, despite the best of intentions, often
   become a deterrent to designers and the design process. Compliance with
   a sustainability rating system is not mandatory; increasingly, it is
   becoming a goal that many designers and authorities would like to
   achieve. In turn, this demands a cost lowering improvement to the
   certification process. Since designers mainly tend to employ commercial
   design tools, it becomes imperative to create a general approach that
   utilizes information already available in digital form and combine it
   with rating system information requirements. The challenge lies in
   identifying informational requirements from rating systems, representing
   them in computable forms, mapping them to information available from a
   commercial design tool and evaluating the performance of the design. In
   this paper we present an overall framework for organizing, managing, and
   representing sustainability information requirements; to demonstrate an
   approach to integrating sustainability evaluations in a design
   environment. We employ a commercially available building information
   modeler and a sustainable building rating system to develop a process
   that bridges sustainability assessment requirements with information
   from the model for pre-evaluation prior to submission for certification.
   This will enable designers, owners, contractors and other professionals
   to communicate strategies and make informed decisions to achieve
   sustainability goals for a project.},

Abstract = {Digital twins, replicating the physical assets it represents, can
   significantly improve efficiency in the execution and operational phase.
   However, building robust and trustworthy digital twins that can be used
   for critical operational decisions, is a key industrial challenge. As a
   response to this challenge DNV has developed a recommended practice
   {[}1] (DNV-RP-A204) for development and assurance of digital twins. The
   methodology was developed in close collaboration with TechnipFMC and
   Aker BP and is currently being used by several leading operators and
   suppliers. While there are standards and commonly agreed best practices
   for how to assure components and systems of physical assets there is
   until now no common agreed standard that a digital twin can be
   developed, delivered, and operated according to. In the recommended
   practice DNV propose the following definition of a digital twin:
   A digital twin is a virtual representation of a system or asset that
   calculates system states and makes system information available, through
   integrated models and data, with the purpose of providing decision
   support over its life cycle.
   The concept of digital twins was first described by David Gelernter's
   1991 book Mirror Worlds and the term `digital twin' was first coined by
   John Vickers of NASA in a 2010 roadmap report. The digital twin concept
   consists of three distinct parts: the asset, the virtual representation,
   and the connection between the two.
   The original definitions have been included in the recommended practice,
   and we further propose to define the level of capability of the digital
   twin from descriptive, via diagnostic and predictive to fully automated
   solutions to increase granularity and to be able to clearly define
   quality assurance requirements.
   The framework developed by DNV address requirements to the
   functionality, operations, the digital twin platform including data
   quality and cyber security aspects, and requirements to the organisation
   developing and operating a digital twin. For each of these areas clearly
   defined working and quality assurance processes and requirements has
   been defined and described.
   The presentation will share the philosophy and key features of the
   methodology in DNV-RP-A204 as well as learnings from ongoing projects.},

Abstract = {Construction is the most resource intensive sector in the world. It
   consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible
   for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated
   emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream
   globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving
   practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address
   both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers
   the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of
   structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as
   opportunities for the development of new business models and the
   creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This
   paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing
   interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and
   outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as
   depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive
   from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote
   reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the
   construction materials with the provision of specialised education,
   skills and training would transform the way construction sector
   currently operates and create opportunities for new business
   development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the
   properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order
   to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components
   are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to
   designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid
   the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient
   tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to
   the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling
   also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction
   works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the
   opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The South Australian Water for Good Strategy outlines the actions that
   are required to ensure South Australia's water supplies are secure,
   safe, reliable and able to sustain continued growth. It supports
   diversification of supplies to reduce the reliance on rain-dependant
   sources. A study has been initiated by the Goyder Institute for Water
   Research in this regard, in particular to inform the identification of
   optimal mixes of water sources for metropolitan Adelaide. As part of
   this study an integrated system simulation model of metropolitan
   Adelaide's water system is being developed. This is to quantify supply
   implications and stormwater and wastewater discharges at defined points
   in the urban water system, when utilising different mixes of water
   sources, under both historical and future climatic conditions. This
   information is used to evaluate an objective function that aims at
   minimising life cycle cost of infrastructure, energy consumption and the
   potential impact on Adelaide's coastal waters, and maximising supply
   security, as part of a multi-objective optimisation based
   decision-support framework. The aim of the decision-support framework is
   to generate knowledge that can support the identification of the most
   cost-effective mix of fit-for-purpose water sources available to meet
   the needs of the community in metropolitan Adelaide, in an
   environmentally and financially sustainable manner. The sources to be
   considered are River Murray, surface water from Mount Lofty Ranges
   catchments, desalinated sea water, recycled wastewater, stormwater
   including roof water, ground water and the potable water savings through
   various demand management options. The objective of this paper is to
   describe the process followed to develop the simulation component of the
   combined simulation-optimisation approach.
   The modelling platform used to develop the simulation model is Source
   Integrated Modelling System (IMS), which is emerging as Australia's
   national hydrologic modelling platform for river basins. Hence it has
   not been applied widely yet, particularly for urban water systems. The
   study reported in this paper one of the first application of eWater
   Source to urban water systems. The application process has been an
   exploratory process where modelling methods have to be developed for the
   each water source considered in this study using the available
   functionalities. Also, there are modelling methods currently in place in
   most cities to inform planning and operation of each city's water supply
   system. In general, when a new modelling method is introduced,
   quantitative evidence is required to demonstrate the performance of the
   new methodology is comparable to that of the existing methodology. Thus
   the process to develop the simulation component of the
   simulation-optimisation approach was staged and comprised the
   development of firstly a Test Case, secondly a Base Case before
   developing the Scenario Cases. In this paper, we describe the Test Case
   and the Base Case. Development of Scenario Cases is in progress. The
   purpose of the Test Case is to examine the ability of the eWater Source
   to represent key features of metro Adelaide's water supply system, to an
   adequate level. The `adequacy' was defined as the ability of eWater
   Source to generate outputs (e. g. pumping volumes and storage volumes)
   of a similar order of magnitude from an existing water supply planning
   and operation model that is currently used by the South Australian Water
   Corporation. The Base Case model represents the `business as usual'
   scenario for supplying water from the three main drinking water supply
   sources for Adelaide, i. e. River Murray, Mount Lofty Ranges catchments
   and Adelaide Desalination Plant. The simulation is performed over 50
   years, on a monthly basis. The optimisation time horizon is 25 years,
   from 2013. The simulation model is provided with functionalities using
   the Expression Editor capability in the eWater Source to evaluate the
   objective function, consisting of net present value of life cycle cost
   of infrastructure, energy consumption and the volumetric reliability of
   supply. Development of Scenario Cases is in progress, which will include
   adding the other sources mentioned above. The Scenario Cases will also
   provide information to minimise potential impact of wastewater and
   stormwater discharges to Adelaide's coastal waters. The results of the
   Test Case showed that eWater Source can adequately represent the
   existing water sources in Adelaide's water supply. The results of the
   Base Case showed that eWater Source can produce the expected behaviour
   of the supply system. The project is in progress.},

Abstract = {Presently, the. construction industry is facing several challenges:
   globalization of the marketplace; increased complexity; larger
   investments; diversity of disciplines involved; widespread stakeholders;
   tight schedules with limited resources; stringent quality standards; and
   changes of project scope. The industry is responding to these challenges
   by understanding the need to rapidly evolve toward an integrated project
   lifecycle. To support the integration of the construction process,
   several methods are emerging. These methods combine isolated theories,
   tools and philosophies that have impacted the construction industry for
   the past decade, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Leadership
   in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), lean construction, etc.
   However, it is difficult to quantify the extent to which those combined
   methods are contributing to process integration. This paper develops a
   framework to define A/E/C/FM integration from a collaboration
   perspective, and to measure the contribution of those combined methods
   towards integration. To develop this framework, the concept of
   integration is defined based on literature findings and expert opinion;
   subsequently, a process model of the construction lifecycle is created
   based on the integrated project delivery approach, defining inputs and
   outputs, stakeholders involved and their interactions, and indicators
   that measure the success/failure of such interactions. The process map
   will be validated through expert opinion. Indicators from the process
   map will be used to per-form a survey to a sample of stakeholders to
   assign weights of importance.},

Abstract = {In contemporary society, customer-centered health care, which stresses
   customer participation and long-term tailored care, is inevitably
   becoming a trend. Compared with the hospital or physician-centered
   healthcare process, the customer-centered healthcare process requires
   more knowledge and modeling such a process is extremely complex. Thus,
   building a care process model for a special customer is cost
   prohibitive. In addition, during the execution of a care process model,
   the information system should have flexibility to modify the model so
   that it adapts to changes in the healthcare process. Therefore,
   supporting the process in a flexible, cost-effective way is a key
   challenge for information technology. To meet this challenge, first, we
   analyze various kinds of knowledge used in process modeling, illustrate
   their characteristics, and detail their roles and effects in careflow
   modeling. Secondly, we propose a methodology to manage a lifecycle of
   the healthcare process modeling, with which models could be built
   gradually with convenience and efficiency. In this lifecycle, different
   levels of process models are established based on the kinds of knowledge
   involved, and the diffusion strategy of these process models is
   designed. Thirdly, architecture and prototype of the system supporting
   the process modeling and its lifecycle are given. This careflow system
   also considers the compatibility of legacy systems and authority
   problems. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate implementation
   of the careflow system.},

Title = {Linking product design in CAD with assembly operations in CAM for
   virtual product assembly},
Journal = {ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {309-323},
Abstract = {Purpose - Virtual product design has become a key technology in reducing
   costly design errors that are often difficult to detect manually. In
   order to evaluate product assembly in a virtual environment, it is
   important to link a product's design in CAD with the constrained
   complexity of assembly operations in CAM so that the design can be
   evaluated and modified in a virtual environment before production
   begins. The paper aims to focus on this.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed virtual system includes the
   following components: a product assembly coding model, named Open
   Structured Assembly Coding System (OSACS), that codes part-mating
   operations for assembling any two parts in CAM; a rule-based code
   extractor that identifies OSACS codes for assembling product from the
   part-mating information encoded in Standard for the Exchange of Product
   Model Data AP-203 CAD data; and an assembly-sequence generator that
   generates a binary assembly-tree for the designed product coded with
   OSACS assembly codes, representing assembly operations in CAM for
   product assembly.
   Findings - The proposed system links the design phase in CAD with the
   manufacturing phase in CAM. Simulation studies were made using CAD
   Ap-203 data files from an actual mobile phone housing assembly. A binary
   assembly-tree assigned with OSACS assembly codes was generated for
   assembling the product. The assembling complexity between any two parts
   was coded with the unique OSACS assembly codes. The final binary
   assembly tree represents how the product is going to be assembled in CAM
   with the mating complexity encoded in the assigned OSACS codes.
   Research limitations/implications - The advantage of this virtual
   product assembly system is that a design can be validated first in a
   virtual environment without building the expensive physical production
   system. Moreover, additional design iterations can be performed in the
   same amount of time to improve product quality.
   Practical implications - Linking product design in CAD with assembly
   operations in CAM can help realize significant cost savings by
   preventing future manufacturing problems. With the proposed virtual
   system, a company can prevent a potential problematic design from
   reaching production.
   Originality/value - This paper introduces the conceptual design of a
   virtual system that links product design in CAD with assembly operations
   in CAM. This system provides a designer with a virtual product assembly
   process to evaluate a designed product.},

Title = {Statistical critical reactive maintenance characterisation for digital
   twin implementation in universities},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3/4, SI},
Pages = {245-273},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {PurposeFacilities management (FM) plays a key role in the performance of
   businesses to ensure the comfort of users and the sustainable use of
   natural resources over operation and maintenance. Nevertheless, reactive
   maintenance (RM) services are characterised by delays, waste and
   difficulties in prioritising services and identifying the root causes of
   failures; this is mostly caused by inefficient asset information and
   communication management. While linking building information modelling
   and the Internet of Things through a digital twin has demonstrated
   potential for improving FM practices, there is a lack of evidence
   regarding the process requirements involved in their implementation.
   This paper aims to address this challenge, as it is the first to
   statistically characterise RM services and processes to identify the
   most critical RM problems and scenarios for digital twin implementation.
   The statistical data analytics approach also constitutes a novel
   practical approach for a holistic analysis of RM
   occurrences.Design/methodology/approachThe research strategy was based
   on multiple case studies, which adopted university campuses as objects
   for investigation. A detailed literature review of work to date and
   documental analysis assisted in generating data on the FM sector and RM
   services, where qualitative and statistical analyses were applied to
   approximately 300,000 individual work requests.FindingsThe work provides
   substantial evidence of a series of patterns across both cases that were
   not evidenced prior to this study: a concentration of requests within
   main campuses; a balanced distribution of requests per building,
   mechanical and electrical service categories; a predominance of low
   priority level services; a low rate of compliance in attending priority
   services; a cumulative impact on the overall picture of five problem
   subcategories (i.e. Building-Door, Mechanical-Plumbing,
   Electrical-Lighting, Mechanical-Heat/Cool/Ventilation and
   Electrical-Power); a predominance of problems in student accommodation
   facilities, circulations and offices; and a concentration of requests
   related to unlisted buildings. These new patterns form the basis for
   business cases where maintenance services and FM sectors can benefit
   from digital twins. It also provides a new methodological approach for
   assessing the impact of RM on businesses.Practical implicationsThe
   findings provide new insights for owners and FM staff in determining the
   criticality of RM services, justifying investments and planning the
   digital transformation of services for a smarter
   provision.Originality/valueThis study represents a unique approach to FM
   and provides detailed evidence to identify novel RM patterns of critical
   service provision and activities within organisations for efficient
   digitalised data management over a building's lifecycle.},

Title = {DEMONSTRATING THE CAPABILITIES OF IEEE STANDARD P1636.2 MAI IN SUPPORT
   OF THE DOD ATS FRAMEWORK},
Booktitle = {2009 IEEE AUTOTESTCON},
Series = {IEEE Autotestcon},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {327-331},
Note = {Annual IEEE AUTOTESTCON Conference, Anaheim, CA, SEP 14-17, 2009},
Organization = {IEEE},
Abstract = {The ATS Framework Working Group focuses on identifying commercial
   standards that are not only acceptable to the needs of the DoD, but to
   industry as well. Therefore, the group is tasked with supporting,
   evaluating, and demonstrating the ability of the standards to meet the
   ATS Framework goals and objectives. Of particular interest to this paper
   is the ATS key element Maintenance Test Data and Services (MTDS). This
   key element addresses a need to share information across maintenance
   levels and across DoD / Industry ATS. The current information structures
   are often Service or platform dependant. Even though these systems do a
   good job of providing a logistics infrastructure, they seldom share
   information back to the maintenance chain or across platforms and
   Services. The sharing of this information is essential in performing
   complex and sophisticated diagnostics over the product's life cycle.
   Given a standard set of definitions and data formats, information may be
   shared among all users who have implemented the standard data content
   and format.
   A family of standards that meets the needs and objectives of the MTDS
   are being developed by the Diagnostic Maintenance Committee (DMC) of
   IEEE SCC20. One particular standard being focused on is the IEEE P1636.2
   Maintenance Action Information (MAI) via Extensible Markup Language
   (XML). This standard is being developed as a component of the IEEE 1636
   Software Interface for Maintenance Information Collection and Analysis
   (SIMICA) standard SIMICA's purpose is to specify a software interface
   for the access, exchange, and analysis of product diagnostic and
   maintenance information. MAI provides a subset of the data needed to
   satisfy SIMICIA requirements. This standard has the capability to obtain
   and provide information to other SCC20 DMC standards. The standard
   facilitates the capture of data associated with the removal, repair, and
   replacement of particular systems / components. The schema, supported by
   its formal information model, defines classes of information that can be
   shared within the SIMICA family of standards.
   This paper will concentrate on the current status of the standard as it
   proceeds towards trial use status. A Phase I demonstration of the MAI
   concepts in a partial use case was conducted during AUTOTESTCON 2008.
   This demonstration showed the MAI's ability to produce standard
   interoperable information exchanges, as well as the use of Commercial
   Off the Shelf (COTS) tools operating in a net centric environment. The
   Phase H demonstration efforts involves interfacing with the IEEE 1636.1
   Test Results and IEEE 1232 AI-ESTATE standards to collect maintenance
   data. This demonstration will stress the benefits achievable in a net
   centric integrated information environment, by building on the Phase I
   demonstration.},

Abstract = {Preservation of cultural heritage plays an important role in society,
   significantly contributing to its sustainability, which is important for
   human development and quality of life. The issue of cultural heritage
   digitization has recently been the subject of increasing research and is
   part of the initiatives of the European Commission for the Promotion of
   Cultural Heritage. Therefore, it is necessary to define the stages of
   the digitization process, which is crucial for cultural heritage
   preservation. The aim of this article was to examine currently used
   technologies and their role in the digitization workflow, and to present
   a detailed historical building information model (HBIM) developed during
   the digitization project at the historic Kunerad Mansion. To meet these
   goals, we will describe the best practices for each discussed
   technology. Special attention is paid to data processing at the very end
   of the object modeling process. Additionally, particular findings alert
   the reader to the need to create object element databases in terms of
   effective point cloud modeling and present the advantages of the
   technologies examined over traditional ways of preserving cultural
   heritage. In addition to predicting procedures, cooperation at a
   multidisciplinary level is needed in a narrower context. On the whole,
   the article provides some useful suggestions for both practitioners and
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Indoor localization has gained importance as it has the potential to
   improve various processes related to the lifecycle management of
   facilities and to deliver personalized and location-based services
   (LBSs). Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems, on the
   other hand, have been widely used in different applications in
   construction and maintenance. This paper investigates the usage of RFID
   technology for indoor localization of RFID equipped assets during the
   operation phase of facilities. The location-related data on RFID tags
   attached to assets are extracted from a Building Information Model (BIM)
   and can provide context-aware information inside the building which can
   improve Facilities Management (FM) processes. First, using the current
   location of the assets saved on the tags attached to fixed assets, an FM
   personnel is able to read tags from a distance and locate them on a
   floor plan. Fixed tags with known positions act as reference tags for
   RFID reader localization techniques. In this scenario, the user can also
   estimate his/her location by scanning the surrounding reference tags.
   Furthermore, the paper investigates an approach to locate moveable
   assets using received signals from available reference tags in the
   building based on pattern matching and clustering algorithms. As a
   result, a user equipped with an RFID reader is able to estimate his/her
   location, as well as the location of target assets, without having
   access to any Real-Time Location System (RTLS) infrastructure. Several
   case studies are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A grey accuracy model for the dynamic measurement system in
   full-lifecycle is put forward to analyse the law of the accuracy motion,
   forecasts and diagnose the system's accuracy. On the basis of the
   information coverage principle; the uncertainty and the absolute values
   of the measuring errors are selected to build the rolling grey model. By
   building two rolling grey models with different data lengths, the
   estimated values for the accuracy and the general trend are obtained. By
   the difference of the two estimated values. the random fluctuation is
   obtained. Through the sample and simulation analysis, the general trend
   and the random fluctuation are obtained at the same time by the two
   rolling grey models, and the accuracy motion of the dynamic measurement
   system can be forecasted. For non-statistical and generating modeling.
   the grey accuracy modeling method can solve the problems of less data,
   lack of information and uncertainty in modeling. The method can
   eliminate the needs for large sample and canonical distribution, and it
   is simple to process.},

Abstract = {Different types of graphs has been successfully used to represent
   designs at different stages of the design process. Changes to a model
   representing a design during the process can be modelled by applying
   graph transformations. In many real life design tasks the
   changes/updates can be carried out simultaneously on different parts of
   the design. Hence a model based on graph transformations is coupled with
   a multiagent paradigm to enable the parallelisation of these
   transformations to mimic the real life approach. In this paper a
   hypergraph representation and transformation model is used as a basis
   for building a multiagent system supporting distribution and adaptation
   in computer aided design. This representation can be applicable
   throughout the lifecycle of the design. It is based on research in
   formal language theory, like graph grammars, and distributed models
   including multiagent systems. The motivation for the work presented here
   is given and possible applications are described. The application of the
   theoretical results in a graph distribution toolkit proposed as a
   multiagent framework is also considered. To assure the efficiency of the
   system it should be implemented as a parallel multiagent system. The
   hypergraph distribution and partial replication, allowing for its parts
   to be managed by agents, is also presented. The approach is illustrated
   by a case study from the domain of building design, where it is used to
   represent, modify and maintain building information. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {Data Fusion for Smart Civil Infrastructure Management: A Conceptual
   Digital Twin Framework},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Effective civil infrastructure management necessitates the utilization
   of timely data across the entire asset lifecycle for condition
   assessment and predictive maintenance. A notable gap in current
   predictive maintenance practices is the reliance on single-source data
   instead of heterogeneous data, decreasing data accuracy, reliability,
   adaptability, and further effectiveness of engineering decision-making.
   Data fusion is thus demanded to transform low-dimensional decisions from
   individual sensors into high-dimensional ones for decision optimization.
   In this context, digital twin (DT) technology is set to revolutionize
   the civil infrastructure industry by facilitating real-time data
   processing and informed decision-making. However, data-driven smart
   civil infrastructure management using DT is not yet achieved, especially
   in terms of data fusion. This paper aims to establish a conceptual
   framework for harnessing DT technology with data fusion to ensure the
   efficiency of civil infrastructures throughout their lifecycle. To
   achieve this objective, a systematic review of 105 papers was conducted
   to thematically analyze data fusion approaches and DT frameworks for
   civil infrastructure management, including their applications, core DT
   technologies, and challenges. Several gaps are identified, such as the
   difficulty in data integration due to data heterogeneity, seamless
   interoperability, difficulties associated with data quality, maintaining
   the semantic features of big data, technological limitations, and
   complexities with algorithm selection. Given these challenges, this
   research proposed a framework emphasizing multilayer data fusion, the
   integration of open building information modeling (openBIM) and
   geographic information system (GIS) for immersive visualization and
   stakeholder engagement, and the adoption of extended industry foundation
   classes (IFC) for data integration throughout the asset lifecycle.},

Abstract = {The management philosophy, namely, Customer relationship management
   (CRM) has been widely accepted and successfully applied across a range
   of sectors. However, there has been very little research efforts in the
   field of CRM in the construction industry. This paper provides a review
   of the CRM philosophy and technology, and considers the implications;
   benefits and challenges to construction organizations at a strategic
   business and operational level. Given the generally unstable economic
   and highly competitive marketplace, implementation of CRM throughout the
   lifecycle of assets may provide for more effective management of
   existing and prospective clients. The CRM approach would seem to be
   compatible with general trends in the construction industry towards more
   collaborative working and the paper provides that both the philosophy
   and technologies can be integrated with current initiatives such as
   building information modeling (BIM). Construction clients in the public
   and private sector are diverse in nature, complex in their buying
   processes and at varying levels of knowledge of the Industry. In
   addition to seeking value for money from their projects and assets, they
   have become more concerned about sustainability and environmental
   impact. It has been recognized that management of a broader range of
   business and project level stakeholders is necessary.},

Abstract = {Fall from height (FFH) in the construction industry has earned much
   attention among researchers in recent years. The present review-based
   study introduced a science mapping approach to evaluate the FFH studies
   related to the construction industry. This study, through an extensive
   bibliometric and scientometric assessment, recognized the most active
   journals, keywords and the nations in the field of FFH studies since
   2000. Analysis of the authors' keywords revealed the emerging research
   topics in the FFH research community. Recent studies have been
   discovered to pay more attention to the application of Computer and
   Information Technology (CIT) tools, particularly building information
   modelling (BIM) in research related to FFH. Other emerging research
   areas in the domain of FFH include rule checking, and prevention through
   design. The findings summarized the mainstream research areas (e.g.,
   safety management program), discussed existing research gaps in FFH
   domain (e.g., the adaptability of safety management system), and
   suggests future directions in FFH research. The recommended future
   directions could contribute to improving safety for the FFH research
   community by evaluating existing fall prevention programs in different
   contexts; integrating multiple CIT tools in the entire project
   lifecycle; designing fall safety courses to workers associated with
   temporary agents and prototype safety knowledge tool development. The
   current study was restricted to the FFH literature sample included the

Abstract = {The building stock accounts for a significant portion of worldwide
   energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. While the majority of
   the existing building stock has poor energy performance, deep renovation
   efforts are stymied by a wide range of human, technological,
   organisational and external environment factors across the value chain.
   A key challenge is integrating appropriate human resources, materials,
   fabrication, information and automation systems and knowledge management
   in a proper manner to achieve the required outcomes and meet the
   relevant regulatory standards, while satisfying a wide range of
   stakeholders with differing, often conflicting, motivations. RINNO is a
   Horizon 2020 project that aims to deliver a set of processes that, when
   working together, provide a system, repository, marketplace and enabling
   workflow process for managing deep renovation projects from inception to
   implementation. This paper presents a roadmap for an open renovation
   platform for managing and delivering deep renovation projects for
   residential buildings based on seven design principles. We illustrate a
   preliminary stepwise framework for applying the platform across the
   full-lifecycle of a deep renovation project. Based on this work, RINNO
   will develop a new open renovation software platform that will be
   implemented and evaluated at four pilot sites with varying construction,
   regulatory, market and climate contexts.},

Title = {Functional and Physical Service Life of Natural Stone Claddings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {During their lifecycle, a building and its components should fulfill a
   set of performance requirements. However, in reality, from the moment in
   which a building is placed in use, its deterioration process begins.
   Buildings and especially their facades, more exposed to the external
   environmental agents, suffer throughout their service life several types
   of depreciation, becoming obsolete, economically destitute, or
   physically deteriorated, leading to the end of their service life. This
   paper intends to establish a correlation between functional criteria
   (FBSL) and physical degradation (Sw) in the definition of service-life
   prediction models. In this study, these models are applied to 203
   natural stone claddings (directly adhered to the substrate), located in
   the Lisbon area, Portugal. The functionality and degradation condition
   of the facades analyzed are evaluated through visual inspections.
   Vulnerability and risks (intrinsic and extrinsic variables) are
   considered in the evaluation of both methods, as the factors that affect
   the physical and functional service life of buildings. These models are
   implemented based on a survey of expert opinion. This study allows
   establishment of a hierarchical scale concerning the priority of
   intervention in the stone claddings, based on physical and functional
   criteria. This information is extremely important in the implementation
   of maintenance programs in large building stocks.},

Title = {Application of Computer Vision in Machine Learning- Based Diagnosis of
   Water Production Mechanisms in Oil Wells},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2365-2384},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Diagnostic plots, introduced by K. S. Chan, are widely used to determine
   excessive water production mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce a
   computer vision model that is capable of segmenting and identifying
   multiple Chan signatures per plot, for the sake of surveillance and
   early screening, given that wells could exhibit diverse mechanisms
   throughout their life cycle. As deep learning (DL) demands a vast amount
   of information, we start our workflow by building a data set of 10,000
   publicly available oil wells that have experienced varying water
   production mechanisms. Next, we perform preprocessing and remove
   anomalies from production data, which could be deceptive in analysis.
   Then, we visualize Chan plots as images and annotate them. Thereafter,
   we split data set, carry out augmentation, and put data together to be
   used as input for a convolutional neural network (CNN) layer.
   Eventually, data are trained utilizing you only look once (YOLO)-a one
   -stage object detector, hyperparameters are tuned, and model performance
   is evaluated using mean average precision (mAP). The collected data from
   fields in Alaska and North Dakota represent oil wells that have been
   producing for decades. When working with wells that possess noisy
   production data, we recognized challenge, bias, and tedium in human
   interpretation of Chan plots. Subsequently, we observed the
   inevitability of cleaning well production data before constructing the
   plots and thoroughly revealed its effect on enhancing model potentiality
   to get a fair score. In addition, we concluded that following a
   systematic approach of active learning, a technique that allows user to
   analyze mistakes of algorithm predictions and label data accordingly,
   accomplished a significant boost in model performance, especially with
   underrepresented classes. The proposed CNN model, which uses automatic
   feature extraction and expresses data in detail, is presumed to be
   robust as it successfully predicted multiple mechanisms of excessive
   water production, with confidence scores higher than 80\%, in wells that
   exhibit different production conditions such as horizontal trajectories,
   artificial lift, waterflooding, stimulation, and other well intervention
   events. In this work, we introduce a novel computer vision model, which
   combines image processing and DL techniques to identify multiple water
   production signatures that a well can undergo and eliminate subjectivity
   of human interpretation. This approach has the potential to be
   effective, as a part of workflow automation, in expeditious surveillance
   of large oil fields. Source code is available on GitHub for public use.},

   zero-energy buildings (ZEBs) in South Korea: A latent class approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {97},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The development of energy-efficient buildings has been deemed a critical
   component in accomplishing reduction targets and making cities more
   sustainable. Hence, governments of highly developed countries with large
   urban populations have set policy targets and introduce incentive
   schemes to expand the supply of the green buildings, which are
   environmentally friendly and energy-efficient over their entire
   lifecycle. However, the low return on investment, lack of awareness, and
   insufficient information and incentives have hindered the adoption of
   zero energy buildings (ZEBs) in the Korean housing sector. This study
   aimed to examine the public's heterogeneous preference structure towards
   residential ZEBs to identify marketing and policy implications for
   promoting demand. The findings showed that cost-related factors were the
   most significant elements affecting public acceptance of ZEBs in Korea.
   Additionally, the study simulated the acceptance of ZEBs as a function
   of subsidy levels and found that consumers are willing to pay a premium
   for more energy-efficient homes with greater environmental contributions
   and that provide long-term benefits in overall housing expenses. In all,
   it is recommended for the government to identify suitable regions for
   the implementation of ZEBs based on regional characteristics and to
   implement a subsidy program to achieve the goal of expanding
   environmentally sustainable homes.},

Abstract = {In the last five years more than 600 construction workers have died at
   work in Germany. This figure shows that safety in construction business
   is still a problem which has to be faced. In most cases safety-planning
   is based on checklists and manual description which are not closely
   related to the actual and specific construction object. The obligatory
   safety and health coordinator on larger construction sites has not
   really improved the overall situation. The objective evaluation of
   safety-planning methods regarding qualitative and quantitative factors
   could be considerably improved by applying innovative and integrated
   safety-planning tools. Modern technologies such as Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) are offering an object-orientated planning through the
   project lifecycle. However, first the construction methods have to be
   analyzed and assessed. This paper proposes a hierarchical
   decision-support system based on criteria assessment. By applying
   Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) the model takes into account five
   main criteria and also their various subcriteria. The main criteria are
   safety, costs, installation effort, flexibility and usability. This
   paper contributes the fundamental analyze of fall protection methods for
   future investigations. As a result, the developed model assists the site
   manager to better evaluate safety measures to prevent fall-related
   accidents.},

   experimental approach of digitization, cataloging, and resource
   discovery in a digital content management system (DigiTool), online
   public access catalog (OPAC) in Aleph and OCLC WorldCat, and
   preservation in Florida Digital Archive (FDA), and MetaArchive while
   introducing connections to information science, organization, and
   information system theories for the development of digital curation
   theory through the theory building strategy of Metatriangulation. The
   paper provides descriptive research insight into exploring the
   application of information science theories, organizational theory
   concepts, and information systems models to the emerging field of
   digital curation in the development of a data management plan that
   includes defining digital curation, data curation, and digital
   preservation. Because of the chosen research approach, the research
   results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged
   to further develop research. The paper aims to contribute to the body of
   knowledge of digital curation through OAIS Reference Model, The DCC
   Curation Lifecycle Model, and Data Management Model digital curation
   theory building through the theory building strategy of
   Metatriangulation. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified
   need to study how digital curation theory building via Metatriangulation
   can be enabled and mapped to Boyer's Model of Scholarship.},

Abstract = {Off-site construction is receiving increasing attention as this
   construction method offers such benefits as improved productivity,
   shortened duration, greater quality, less whole-life cost, and less
   environmental impact. The concept of just-in-time has been applied in
   the manufacturing industry, improving performance and reducing waste;
   however, it has not been commonly used in the construction industry.
   When optimal delivery dates of components deviate from the schedule due
   to unexpected events, contractors and manufacturers tend to comply with
   contracts instead of seeking coordination to achieve just-in-time, which
   results in non-optimal solutions. In addressing this issue, the proposed
   conceptual model incorporates a dynamic and distributed solution: (1)
   manufacturers provide the surcharges or incentives of potential delivery
   changes via an information-sharing platform; (2) based on data from
   manufacturers and on-site resources, contractors carry out automated
   changes of the delivery plans when their progress deviates from the
   assembly schedule; ( 3) contractors make possible automated changes to
   the assembly schedule when manufacturers offer incentives for delivery
   delay. This paper investigates the development of just-in-time
   application in prefabricated building and proposes a solution to reduce
   the time and storage waste resulted from underutilised resources in
   component delivery. The proposed model incorporates a data-sharing
   platform, dynamic resource management system of manufacturers and
   optimisation system of contractors, which encourages stakeholders to
   coordinate to reach optimal. The model is expected to contribute to
   just-in-time delivery with dynamic compensation and offer a solution to
   balance the benefits of stakeholders.},

Abstract = {This study's goal is to investigate impediments to successful enterprise
   system (ES) implementation across the system lifecycle. Drawing from the
   opinions of 82 ES practitioners and building on the authors' previous
   work on source problems in ES adoption, this study performs the further
   data analysis incorporating the ES lifecycle. The analysis employs the
   Cooper and Zmud's six-stage model of IT diffusion and investigates how
   the difficulties change along the ES lifecycle. Our findings suggest
   that Adaptation phase, which is the main implementation stage, is the
   most challenging period of the ES adoption project. The results also
   indicate that problems with employees are the most significant
   impediments to ES adoption success. The findings imply that difficulties
   during later stages of the ES adoption can be minimized by an
   appropriate system choice, a good training schedule, and the preparation
   of an appropriate IT infrastructure and database needed by the new
   system.},

Abstract = {Increasing integration of different disciplines such as mechanics,
   electrics/electronics and control software has led to higher complexity
   in the development of an automated production system (aPS), bringing
   forth some challenges along with it. In order to address these
   challenges, a multi-disciplinary engineering workflow can be built using
   a model-based system engineering (MBSE) approach. However, the various
   tools in different disciplines impede the efficient collaboration of
   different models. Because of the implicit dependencies between different
   disciplines, it is difficult to ensure the consistency after a change.
   This paper provides an approach to building an efficient
   multi-disciplinary engineering workflow based on MBSE. Through a
   combination of SysML4Mechatronics modeling language with inconsistency
   management and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), the proposed
   engineering workflow facilitates the design of multi-disciplinary aPS
   and supports information tracking, consistency assurance, as well as
   change analysis across disciplines. The benefits of the proposed
   approach are demonstrated with a case study on a lab-sized production
   plant.},

   Applications to Industrial Plant Facilities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While industrial plant projects are becoming bigger, and global
   attention to the plant as a construct is increasing, space arrangement
   in plant projects is inefficient because of the complex structure of
   required facilities (e.g., complex MEP (mechanical, electrical, and
   plumbing) installations, specialized tools, etc.,). Furthermore,
   problems during installation, operation, and maintenance stages caused
   by inconsistencies between floor plans and actual layout are on the
   rise. Although some of these conflicts can be addressed through clash
   detection using BIM (building information modeling), quality BIM models
   are scarce, especially for existing industrial plants. This study
   proposes a way to address the complexities caused by changes during
   plant construction and securing space for the installation of equipment
   during the construction and lifecycle of built facilities. 3D cloud
   point data of space and equipment were collected using 3D laser scanning
   to conduct space matching. In processing the space matching, data were
   simplified by applying the 3D grid and by comparing the data, easier
   identification of the space for target equipment was accomplished. This
   study also proposed a pre-processing method based on sub-sampling that
   optimizes the point cloud data and verifies the processing speed and
   accuracy. Lastly, it finds free space for various equipment layouts
   required in industrial plant projects by space analysis, proposed
   algorithms, and processes for obtaining the coordinates of valid space
   for equipment arrangement. The proposed method of this study is expected
   to help solve the problems derived from arrangement and installation of
   new equipment in a complex plant site.},

Abstract = {The need for efficient and sustainable infrastructure - always critical
   to a city - is further gaining momentum as urbanisation creates the
   challenge of sustainably designing, constructing and operating the built
   environment. The AECOO industry, directly responsible for addressing
   this challenge, has adopted the use of BIM and GIS to aid in this
   endeavour. Both BIM and GIS overlap with respect to capturing aspects of
   the built environment, but are not interoperable by nature. To ensure a
   consistent and structured way of managing the information produced
   within these environments, industry standards such as IFC are
   implemented. Research to date focuses on addressing the integration
   between BIM and GIS for buildings by delving into the IFC and CityGML
   interoperability, which has highlighted significant geometric and
   semantic barriers that in the stage of integration, cannot be easily
   manoeuvred. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight regarding
   the information lifecycle during Design \& Construction in the HS2 Rail
   Infrastructure project and investigate the impact of current information
   management processes - and in particular Standards such as IFC, - on
   BIM-GIS interoperability and lifecycle management of an asset. Results
   demonstrate the levels of mis mapping during the export to IFC which
   varies depending on the infrastructure asset type. Discussion shows that
   these can be addressed by the introduction of additional semantic
   property sets to facilitate downstream BIM-GIS interoperability for O \&
   M, enabling scope for future work.},

Title = {Maintaining focus on clients' requirements using the DQI tool Towards a
   requirements-oriented project process},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {271-283},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the contribution of
   the design quality indicator (DQI) tool in the management of client
   requirements in construction projects, and propose a
   requirements-oriented project process (ROPP) to ensure continued focus
   on client requirements throughout the lifecycle of a project.
   Design/methodology/approach - Direct participant involvement and case
   studies of building projects that have used the DQI tool are used to
   analyse the extent to which DQI contributes to the management of client
   requirements.
   Findings - Case study analysis suggests that the DQI enhances focus on
   client and project stakeholder requirements through the initial quality
   aspirations set out at the beginning of a project, but it is limited in
   its scope to address a more comprehensive requirements profile.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed ROPP model is
   conceptual and requires further development to test its effectiveness in
   enhancing focus on client requirements. However, given current
   developments in automated checking in BIM and other environments, this
   offers scope for further research in this area.
   Originality/value - Maintaining focus on client requirements throughout
   the process is a key criterion for project success. However, given the
   many stakeholders involved, and the progressive translation into various
   project documents, there is a risk that focus on the original/evolving
   requirements of the client can be lost. Current approaches such as the
   DQI have limitations and a robust ROPP is, therefore, a key contribution
   to securing clients' objectives over the project lifecycle.},

   analyze different building materials (using the model) by exploiting
   different BIM simulation capabilities (i.e. energy analysis, cost,
   schedule, etc.). Amongst a range of benefits (using evolutionary
   systems), integration of building materials is capable of having a
   notable impact on the construction process lifecycle if considered
   correctly. This paper present a conceptual framework which exploits
   genetic algorithm for generation of design alternatives by reflecting
   materials at the early design stages (through parameterization).
   Therefore, material parameters will be added to the evolutionary system
   as design requirements and constraints for generation.},

Abstract = {The DiMoWind-Inspect research project explored the essential
   requirements for implementing digital methods in the maintenance of
   offshore wind turbines. Currently, data from all stages of the turbines'
   lifecycles are underutilized, leading to suboptimal maintenance actions
   being taken in terms of location, timing, and cost. A consistent
   structuring of previously often unstructured construction and
   maintenance data developed in the project enables their
   cross-disciplinary, user-specific availability. To accomplish this, the
   principles of the Reference Designation System for Power Plants RDS-PP
   are applied. In this way, additional information, such as maintenance
   measures or defects, can be structured alongside components. The
   components of the structures are directly linked with information from
   inspections and other maintenance activities, following the Building
   Information Modeling approach. This allows for processing operational
   information about the condition of the structure and providing it for
   relevant calculations and assessments. As a use case, a two-stage
   concept is presented, utilizing maintenance information to assess the
   fatigue life of a corrosion-damaged structural detail in the support
   structure of an offshore wind turbine.},

Abstract = {Digital twins run concurrently with the assets and systems they mirror.
   They offer real-time execution of advanced control schemes, e.g., for
   smart buildings, but also various analysis tasks, e.g., for predictive
   maintenance that ensures resilience. In this, they need to cope with
   change: The physical twins they mirror operate in a highly dynamic
   environment with unknown or unexpected variables and impact factors to
   which they adapt or are adapted to via upgrades, maintenance, or
   behavioral changes. Keeping digital twins fit for their purpose over
   their lifecycle is thus a demanding governance challenge that needs to
   be addressed in tandem with the lifecycle management of the mirrored
   system. We argue that the best practices of Systems Engineering (SE) and
   Information Technology (IT), especially software development, need to be
   brought together to succeed. In this paper, we present a joint SE and IT
   lifecycle model called the Double Helix model. It highlights the
   concurrent governance processes of both twins, capturing the temporal
   dynamics of the environment and the system itself. It accents the
   important concept of the leading twin. The Double Helix model captures
   both design and operational phases of SE and management, going from
   cradle to grave, by empowering a shift from using data in offline
   simulations during design, to the online operational phase.},

Title = {Digital Twin Approach in Buildings: Future Challenges via a Critical
   Literature Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In 2011, the term Digital Twin was originally introduced by Michael
   Grieves to define the synchronization between two realities: physical
   objects placed in a real space and virtual objects within in virtual
   space, linked through the mutual exchange of data throughout the entire
   lifecycle, both in real-time and asynchronously. Nowadays, Digital Twin
   is among the principal and emerging technological innovations of both
   Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0, enabling an interaction
   between physical and virtual objects, Big Data, Internet of Things, and
   Artificial Intelligence. The construction sector, too, is now exploring
   the potentialities offered by the Digital Twin approach in enhancing
   innovative, responsible, and sustainable governance of buildings'
   lifecycles. Concerning these issues, this paper proposes visualizing
   future challenges with a specific focus on the operation and maintenance
   phase and its related impact on decarbonization via a critical
   literature review of the current statements. The applied methodology is
   based on three different questions related to certain research issues
   performed in the Scopus database. The selected findings were filtered,
   classified, and discussed. Some future challenges on specific issues
   have been identified, defining and promoting novel research ideas.},

Title = {BIM and DfMA: A Paradigm of New Opportunities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The main goal of this study is to explore the adoption of a design for
   manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) and building information management
   (BIM) approach during the whole lifecycle of assets. This approach aims
   to tackle issues inherent in the design of traditional construction
   methods, such as low productivity and quality, poor predictability and
   building performance, and energy use, through the implementation of a
   BIM library of off-site components. In recent years, a renewed interest
   has been directed to the attempt to provide solutions to these urgent
   problems through the adoption of new advancements in technologies.
   However, while there are studies focussing on a BIM-DfMA approach, there
   is a lack of research regarding how this approach should be adopted
   during the whole lifecycle of the assets. Furthermore, to the best of
   our knowledge, defining an efficient way of developing a component-based
   BIM object library has not yet been included in any of the available
   studies. A mixed methodology approach has been used in this research. A
   conceptual framework was developed as the result of an extensive
   literature review to investigate new advancements in the AEC sector.
   Following the literature review, the framework was tested and validated
   through a case study based on the production and adoption of a BIM
   library of off-site components at the design stage of an asset. The
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has
   recognised the necessity of a new approach that helps to resolve the
   well-known issues presented in traditional methods of construction. The
   conceptual framework and case study proposed presents a valuable new
   method of construction that support the implementation of a BIM and DfMA
   approach, highlighting their benefits. This framework has been created
   using many valuable and reliable sources of information. The result of
   this research supports the idea of a novel new construction method that
   focuses on a manufacturing-digital-driven industry, with the use of DfMA
   in a BIM-integrated approach. This novel method will add significance
   and be beneficial for a wide range of aspects in the construction
   sector, contributing to the theoretical and practical domain.},

Abstract = {Building a virtual machine tool model not only is advantageous for

   operations, but also is a didactic resource for training users about
   operating physical machine tools. A generic procedure for developing a
   numerically controlled virtual machine tool in a standard PLM (product
   lifecycle management) platform is given. The procedure was applied to
   model the Hartford SMC5 machining center using the software Siemens NX
   9. The first step in the process simplifies the machining center into a
   hierarchy of components using kinematic chains; the second step assigns
   information regarding motion to each machine component; the final step
   controls the movements of the machine components by means of a virtual
   controller and a postprocessor. Once complete, a validation procedure of
   the model is provided by modeling, simulating, and executing the
   manufacturing process of a selected workpiece with complex surfaces.},

Title = {Predicting climatic threats to an endangered freshwater mussel in
   Europe: The need to account for fish hosts},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera has been
   suffering major population declines in Europe. This endangered species
   is a host specialist and exclusively requires salmonid species (Salmo
   trutta and Salmo salar) to complete its life cycle. In theory,
   obligatory biotic interactions should deserve special conservation
   attention, because the loss or massive decline of fish hosts may elicit
   the extirpation of their affiliated species. While many threats
   disturbing M. margaritifera are similarly affecting salmonids, climate
   change is particularly alarming, with the potential to significantly
   change the fish-mussel dynamics. To evaluate the importance of including
   the occurrence of fish hosts for predicting the distribution of M.
   margaritifera in Europe, three datasets were used to build species
   distribution models (SDMs) with a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach: (1)
   environmental variables (ENV); (2) probability of fish hosts occurrence
   (FH); and (3) environmental variables and probability of fish hosts
   occurrence (ENV + FH). We identified the environmental variables that
   better explain M. margaritifera distribution and modelled its current
   and future distribution under a suite of climate change scenarios.
   Furthermore, projections were used to evaluate the adequacy of current
   networks of European protected areas in covering the suitable habitats
   for M. margaritifera. Results showed that incorporating data about fish
   hosts into M. margaritifera SDMs avoided the overprediction of
   geographical projections and, to a minor extent, improved model
   performance (area under the curve: ENV = 0.851; FH = 0.848; ENV + FH =
   0.867). The distribution range of M. margaritifera in Europe is expected
   to contract in all future timeframes and emission scenarios considered.
   Forecasts point to large contractions particularly in central and
   southern Europe and lowland regions. The European network of protected
   areas fails to protect 69\% of the current and 66\%-67\% of the future
   predicted M. margaritifera distribution. This study clearly illustrates
   the importance of including mussel-fish hosts interactions for
   accurately predicting M. margaritifera's distribution. The response of
   M. margaritifera to environmental variables highlights its vulnerability
   to the higher temperatures, particularly in southern Europe. While
   predictions indicate large contractions in M. margaritifera's
   distribution as a result of future climate change, the current European
   network of protected areas fails to safeguard M. margaritifera. This
   work provides strong evidence for proposing the generalised use of
   biotic information about hosts in addition to purely environmental
   variables to model the distribution of freshwater mussels, as well as
   for other species with obligatory biotic interactions. Building SDMs
   such as those discussed here can inform political decision-making about
   the likely scenarios for species occurrence in future decades, the
   requirements needed for an effective conservation strategy, and the
   regions where conservation should be a priority.},

Abstract = {Construction Project Planning, as one of the key processes in the
   project lifecycle, shapes the empirical foundation of the project
   success and plays a primary role in optimizing and managing construction
   operation. Dependence on the traditional techniques and documents in
   construction planning and scheduling still faces numerous difficulties
   and obstacles.
   Recently, research efforts have tried to enhance planning capabilities
   with improved and even new methods and techniques.
   This paper reviews the current planning techniques utilized in the
   construction industry, inspects the current construction planning
   approach challenges and suggests an integrated solution for better
   construction plans.
   This research paper is divided into three main stages. In the first
   stage, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify the
   construction planning processes, construction planning techniques and
   the major limitations and challenges facing the current planning
   process. Then, a survey was carried out in order to verify the
   construction planning challenges found throughout the literature review.
   Based on the extracted facts from the survey, the suggestions were
   introduced as an integrated approach starting from adopting new project
   delivery methods toward using improved planning techniques.},

Abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) uses models as first-class artefacts
   during the software development lifecycle. MDE often relies on
   domain-specific languages (DSLs) to develop complex systems. The
   construction of a new DSL implies a deep understanding of a domain,
   whose relevant knowledge may be scattered in heterogeneous artefacts,
   like XML documents, (meta-)models, and ontologies, among others. This
   heterogeneity hampers their reuse during (meta-)modelling processes.
   Under the hypothesis that reusing heterogeneous knowledge helps in
   building more accurate models, more efficiently, in previous works we
   built a (meta-)modelling assistant called Extremo. Extremo represents
   heterogeneous information sources with a common data model, supports its
   uniform querying and reusing information chunks for building
   (meta-)models. To understand how and whether modelling assistants-like
   Extremo-help in designing a new DSL, we conducted an empirical study,
   which we report in this paper. In the study, participants had to build a
   meta-model, and we measured the accuracy of the artefacts, the perceived
   usability and utility and the time to completion of the task.
   Interestingly, our results show that using assistance did not lead to
   faster completion times. However, participants using Extremo were more
   effective and efficient, produced meta-models with higher levels of
   completeness and correctness, and overall perceived the assistant as
   useful. The results are not only relevant to Extremo, but we discuss
   their implications for future modelling assistants.},

Abstract = {In Europe the number of existing buildings is greater than new ones,
   therefore it is necessary to improve built heritage management through
   suitable IT tools. Actually, BIM is an innovative methodology to
   optimize building lifecycle. Since BIM was born for new buildings, there
   are difficulties in using it for historical architectural heritage.
   Thus, the purpose of the research is to describe a possible strategy to
   develop 3D parametric models that can be easily used for many uses
   through a set of rules based on the description of construction
   components oriented to different objectives, e.g. restoration, energy
   saving, structural monitoring, healthcare facilities. This paper aims to
   discover a possible approach to implement a generic HBIM model which can
   be developed through the combination with a model based on intelligent

Title = {Parametric embodied carbon prediction model for early stage estimating},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {106-119},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The focus of carbon management is shifting from operational carbon to
   embodied carbon as a result of the improved operational energy
   efficiency of buildings. Measuring and managing embodied carbon right
   from the early stages of projects will unlock a range of opportunities
   to achieve the highest possible emissions reduction which could not be
   achieved otherwise during the latter stages. However, measuring embodied
   carbon during the early stages of design is challenging and highly
   uncertain due to the unavailability of detailed design information.
   Therefore, the research presented in this paper addresses this problem
   in a structured and an objective way. A parametric embodied carbon
   prediction model was developed using regression analysis to estimate
   embodied carbon when only minimal design information is available and
   with less uncertainty. The model was developed by collecting historical
   data of office buildings in the UK from four different data sources and
   estimating embodied carbon by combining several estimating techniques.
   Wall to floor ratio and the number of basements were identified as the
   model predictors with a model fit of 48.1\% (R-2). A five-fold
   cross-validation ensured that the model predicts within the acceptable
   accuracy range for new data. The developed model had an accuracy of +/-
   89.35\% which is within the acceptable accuracy range for an early stage
   prediction model. In addition, the need for standardising embodied
   carbon measurements and to develop embodied carbon benchmarks to
   facilitate embodied carbon estimating throughout the project lifecycle
   were emphasised. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The management of the processes related to proposal, design,
   construction, start-up, operation and decommissioning of industrial
   plants, in few words the whole Plant Lifecycle, are usually performed
   each by means of a specialised information tool, because of the
   peculiarities of the Engineering and Contracting (E\&C) sector. The E\&C
   Companies are aware of the need to move towards an integration of such
   tools, under the umbrella of the PLM (Product Lifecyclc Management) new
   acronym. As in other sectors, like the manufacturing industry, such
   convergence happens in two different ways: a) the modular offer of a
   single software vendor, usually a market leader, who tries to establish
   a proprietary data warehouse of all the lifecycle information; b) an
   agreement of different players on some standard for the representation
   of such information, in order to develop IT tools which are able to
   access and exchange meaningful information. Whichever approach will
   emerge as a winner, the authors think that it would be useful to define
   a Reference Model for the Plant Lifecycle processes, proposing an
   ontology for their business and technical objects, their relationships
   and management. Such reference model, developed in a standard modelling
   language, could be of great help both in developing new integrated PLM
   solutions, and to enable stand-alone packages to establish an effective
   integrations based on the data and information.},

   within the lifecycle of a DES study. It is recognized that for large
   companies the data collection and representation phase differs when

   prohibitively high. DES-related data can be stored in a variety of
   formats and it is not always evident what data is required (if even
   available) to support a DES model in relation to specific problem
   scenarios. Building on previous research output, this paper presents the

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning
   (DL) are technologies that have recently transformed many industries.
   The construction industry has traditionally been a laggard industry in
   terms of digital-technology adoption. When leading firms in this
   industry have experimented with these technologies, many of these
   experiments have met resistance. In this paper we take an institutional
   lens to study why and particular social structures appears to have
   contributed to the resistance and paucity of success stories. Within
   institutional research, we focus on research with traces to cognitive
   science and psychology. We have carried out a qualitative embedded
   multiple-case study on resistance to new technologies and how to
   overcome such resistance. The study involves four use cases in the
   Finnish construction industry: (1) automation of a material-product
   subcontractor's production planning; (2) business-model innovation by
   contractor on how to best work across multiple construction sites at
   once; (3) machine learning and automation of documentation by a software
   firm; and (4) promotion of a vision of information sharing across
   organizations by the above software firm. Based on within and cross-case
   analyses, preliminary empirical findings are that AI, ML and DL have in
   the Finnish construction industry challenged institutionalized forms of
   organizing and workflow established long since in the industry and,
   until about the time of this piece of research, taken for granted.
   Resistance was nonetheless beginning to be overcome at the time of
   writing this piece of research with small-group interaction across
   firms- such as those in this study- in the industry ecosystem.
   Human-human mediation and face-to-face encounters were building trust in
   and across the organizations. The implication for practice and policy is
   that business transformation will not quickly and autonomously transform
   into ``impersonal{''} or machine-machine exchange but, before that,
   requires human-human mediation. ``In the long-term, Al and analytics
   have boundless potential use cases in E\&C {[}i.e. engineering and
   construction]. Machine learning is gaining some momentum as an
   overarching use case (that is, one applicable to the entire construction
   life cycle, from preconstruction through O\&M 8i.e. operations and
   management), particularly in reality capture (for example, in
   conjunction with computer vision) as well as for comparison of in situ
   field conditions with plans (for example, supporting twin models).
   Indeed, by applying machine learning to an ongoing project, schedules
   could be optimized to sequence tasks and hit target deadlines, and
   divergences from blueprints could be caught closer to real time and
   corrected using a variety of predetermined potential scenarios.{''}

Abstract = {The digital transformation in agriculture introduces new challenges in
   terms of data, knowledge and technology adoption due to critical
   interoperability issues, and also challenges regarding the
   identification of the most suitable data sources to be exploited and the
   information models that must be used. DEMETER (Building an
   Interoperable, Data-Driven, Innovative and Sustainable European
   Agri-Food Sector) addresses these challenges by providing an overarching
   solution that integrates various heterogeneous hardware and software
   resources (e.g., devices, networks, platforms) and enables the seamless
   sharing of data and knowledge throughout the agri-food chain. This paper
   introduces the main concepts of DEMETER and its reference architecture
   to address the data sharing and interoperability needs of farmers, which
   is validated via two rounds of 20 large-scale pilots along the DEMETER
   lifecycle. This paper elaborates on the two pilots carried out in region
   of Murcia in Spain, which target the arable crops sector and demonstrate
   the benefits of the deployed DEMETER reference architecture.},

Title = {Building on Digital Twin: Overcoming Barriers and Unlocking Success in
   the Construction Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) link physical and virtual spaces, providing
   analytical and diagnostic value for built assets. Despite DT's potential
   benefits, its adoption in the construction industry is nascent, hindered
   by underexplored barriers and a lack of practical strategies. This study
   (1) identified barriers to DT adoption, (2) proposes strategies to spur
   DT adoption, and (3) prioritizes identified barriers and strategies and
   assesses the varying perceptions of organizations with different types
   and sectors on these factors. This study conducted a comprehensive
   literature review and content analysis, complemented by pilot
   interviews, to identify and categorize 25 barriers and 23 strategies. A
   survey questionnaire was distributed to industry professionals, and 91
   valid responses were received for analysis. The survey and postsurvey
   interviews helped prioritize these barriers and strategies and assess
   different construction organizations' perceptions of DT adoption.
   Additionally, two case studies were conducted to gain deeper insights
   into DT's real-world applications, barriers, and strategies. This study
   enriches the knowledge base by identifying and assessing the barriers
   and strategies for DT adoption and provides construction practitioners
   with actionable guidance for adopting DT.
   This study presents five key insights for implementing digital twins in
   the construction industry. First, it identified 25 barriers and 23
   strategies for DT adoption. Practitioners should pay attention to the
   top barriers, such as cost pressures, lack of models and data, and
   uncertain economic returns, while prioritizing effective strategies such
   as senior management support, clear objectives and expected outcomes
   from clients, and financial subsidies. Second, facility management (FM)
   and architect organizations face more challenges in adopting DT, so
   their needs should be prioritized when applying strategies. Third, the
   private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, encounters
   greater challenges in DT adoption than the public sector due to limited
   IT infrastructure. Collaboration between the public and private sectors
   is recommended to overcome this challenge. Fourth, senior management
   plays a crucial role in creating a DT-friendly environment by training
   DT-competent employees and shifting conservative organizational
   cultures. The study presents two real-life examples of successful DT
   adoption in construction, providing valuable insights for practitioners.},

Title = {Acoustic Characteristics of Cross-Laminated Timber Systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The growing diffusion of cross-laminated timber structures (CLT) has
   been accompanied by extensive research on the peculiar characteristics
   of this construction system, mainly concerning its economic and
   environmental benefits, lifecycle, structural design, resistance to
   seismic actions, fire protection, and energy efficiency. Nevertheless,
   some aspects have not yet been fully analysed. These include both the
   knowledge of noise protection that CLT systems are able to offer in
   relation to the possible applications and combinations of building
   elements, and the definition of calculation methods necessary to support
   the acoustic design. This review focuses on the main acoustic features
   of CLT systems and investigate on the results of the most relevant
   research aimed to provide key information on the application of acoustic
   modelling in CLT buildings. The vibro-acoustic behaviour of the basic
   component of this system and their interaction through the joints has
   been addressed, as well as the possible ways to manage acoustic
   information for calculation accuracy improvement by calibration with
   data from on-site measurements during the construction phase. This study
   further suggests the opportunity to improve measurement standards with
   specific reference curves for the bare CLT building elements, in order
   to compare different acoustic linings and assemblies on the same base.
   In addition, this study allows to identify some topics in the literature
   that are not yet fully clarified, providing some insights on possible
   future developments in research and for the optimization of these
   products.},

Abstract = {In the 21(st) century, sedimentary basins are moving rapidly from
   single-use zones - such as petroleum - to highly complex, vertically and
   laterally stratified, multiple-use zones. Several independent industry
   and community sectors, such as petroleum, water, geological carbon
   storage, coal seam methane and geothermal, will be competing for access
   to, and the use of, limited pore space and the resources within it.
   These sectors are often in direct conflict, for example geothermal
   energy production and geological carbon storage (GCS) are almost
   mutually exclusive. Geothermal is also in competition with the water
   sector (agriculture, communities etc) for the right-to-produce fluids.
   This new environment requires an innovative and proactive response from
   government, one in which the relative value and benefit of a wide
   variety of known and potential resources can be quantitatively assessed,
   and thereby managed, for the benefit of the State. This requires the
   building of robust and high-resolution geoscience information and
   knowledge systems which support the informed management of basins as
   multiple use zones, thus enabling the GCS, geothermal, petroleum and
   water sectors to co-exist and prosper. These basin resource management
   frameworks must be constructed at a regional-scale to allow assessments
   to be made of potential impacts and relative values of all relevant
   earth resources.
   As part of the Victorian Government's geological carbon storage
   assessment, GeoScience Victoria's VicGCS initiative has been collating,
   interpreting and integrating a wide-range of disparate geoscientific
   data from the onshore and offshore Gippsland Basin, the premier
   geological carbon storage location in Australia. The data include the
   distribution and properties of sedimentary horizons and faults
   (including the construction of basin-scale 3D models), rock property
   data, fluid compositions (water, hydrocarbons etc) and fluid flow
   properties, pressure data, reservoir data and extensive investigations
   of containment, to build highly complex and predictive geoscience
   models. In addition to providing a quantitative and agreed means of
   assessing and managing earth resources, the models provide data and
   ideas which dramatically improve the understanding of the current and
   undiscovered resource inventory.
   The basin resource management framework for the Gippsland Basin provides
   government with the management tool-kit and knowledge necessary to
   develop an informed strategy to manage the basin's pore space and other
   resources, in order to maximize the benefit from each resource and to
   minimize potential conflicts between competing resource sectors. This
   knowledge will also facilitate the gazettal of GCS acreage, GCS
   roll-out, and provide the basis for monitoring the basin through the GCS
   life-cycle. For example, through sufficient understanding of fluid
   migration in the basin, it is possible to monitor plumes of injected
   CO2, as well as the far-field effects of the injected plumes (e.g.
   formation pressure and the water table) across the entire basin. The
   regional or basin-scale knowledge required by government complements the
   focused and much more site-specific studies undertaken by industry. (C)

Title = {Survey on the use of BIM methodology for railway 3D modeling},
Journal = {DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {This article explores the development of Augmented Reality (AR) models
   for railway projects, as illustrated in Fig. 1, with particular emphasis
   on interoperability between different systems and platforms. The
   historical development of Building In- formation Modeling (BIM) is
   traced from its origins in computer-aided de- sign (CAD) to its recent
   applications in diverse fields. Significant milestones and the evolution
   of BIM into project lifecycle management are highlighted. Fundamental
   aspects such as Level of Development (LOD) and Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) file types are reviewed. The integration of BIM with
   machine learning and AR has enormous po- tential to improve asset
   management and decision-making in railway projects. The importance of
   interoperability when integrating AR into railway projects using BIM
   methodology, highlighting tools and models that ensure seamless
   operation across various platforms and software systems, is discussed.
   Stan- dards such as ISO 19650 and ISO 16739 are fundamental in this
   context. Studies that demonstrate the advantages of BIM in railway
   projects, in- cluding cost control, error detection and better
   maintenance planning, are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities
   associated with integrating BIM into rail are discussed, including the
   importance of technological advances in promoting increasingly
   efficient, collaborative and sustainable maintenance projects. This
   research is important for advancing the study and development of
   integration and compatibility with new technologies, specifically in the
   con-text of the use of BIM methodologies in railways, particularly in
   locomotives and carriages, and the application of AR, making a
   significant contribution to the fields of computer engineering,
   maintenance engineering and others.},

Title = {Integrated Structural Processes on Innovative Multidisciplinary Projects
   Supported by Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study sought to develop a formalized integrated structural process
   that is enhanced by information and communication technologies (ICT).
   Formalized integrated structural processes can significantly improve the
   design of the building structural system in relation to other engineered
   and aesthetic systems through making a complementary and cohesive
   solution when followed. That said, current practices lack this
   significant workflow. The more multidisciplinary the design is, the more
   robust, innovated, and integrated the solution is with respect to the
   owners' vision. Such a process has the ability to eliminate barriers and
   limitations on effective and efficient collaboration with other
   disciplines. The resulting integrated structural process model (ISPM)
   presented here was developed through literature, industry expert
   interviews, and case study projects. The end result is overarching in
   nature, in that it is not structural material or structural system
   specific, yet its scope is comprehensive because it encompasses a
   project from planning through construction. Results show that adopters
   of the ISPM can strengthen their integrated design practices within
   their structural firms. Core contributions of the ISPM add to
   traditional processes, including adopting later lifecycle notions as
   early as possible to provide a positive impact, detailing what modeling
   and technology can be used to support integrated design, determining
   what is necessary from other trades at different design points, carrying
   design options and solutions along further for more objective decision
   making, and more strictly adhering to meeting and achieving
   cross-competitive goals. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {THE IDEALIZED MODELS OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS REENGINEERING},
Journal = {RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL},
Year = {2019},
Number = {1},
Pages = {150-156},
Abstract = {Content. Software systems are used in a variety of branches of life and
   human activities, but they are most widely used in industries where it
   is necessary to work with many routine operations - this applies to
   industry, production, transportation, training and info communications.
   Of course, in the process of exploiting these systems there is an
   evolutionary aging of the different types of security. This trend leads
   to a deterioration of high-speed, information-communication, graphic,
   time and other characteristics, up to the complete failure of the
   software system. The subject of the article is aimed to the design of
   ergative systems, project management and programs for re-designing or
   improving these systems. Reengineering allows the system to evolve, by
   making positive changes to its structure in order to improve operational
   characteristics and technical support.
   Objective. To form a representation of the estimation of resource cost
   parameters for the reengineering of software systems with the help of a
   mathematical tools for describing design models.
   Method. The idea of the article is based on the Boehm method and the
   principles of building an Archimedes spiral. Author's research led to
   the idea of combining Boehm and Archimedes structures, adapting them to
   the software engineering methodology and transferring them to a
   cylindrical coordinate system. The basis of the obtained models is laid
   spiral principle of the organization of the reference.
   Results. The article deals with the process of creating and visualizing
   mathematical models in relation to the process of reengineering software
   systems. Transactions with these models can occur in projections of time
   and cost, in the isometric projection of software components, and in the
   logarithmic projection of lines of software code.
   Conclusions. For the first time, idealized models of reengineering have
   been formed, which will allow to increase the accuracy of cost
   estimation from the redesign of software systems. The model of cost
   visualization for reprogramming of software systems has been improved,
   which will increase the efficiency of forecasting the order of expenses.
   For the first time dependencies were obtained on the construction of the
   graphical cost model trajectory from the introduced reengineering
   automation coefficient and the similarity coefficient of the components
   that would make changes to the configuration of the model. The proposed
   idealized models for reengineering of software system security are
   evolutionary spirals, which are constructed in a cylindrical coordinate
   system. Reengineering, which will be accomplished with the help of
   developed idealized reengineering models, will not only reduce the cost
   of reprogramming software systems, but also increase the efficiency of
   technical support, increase the life cycle of software systems which are
   already in service and overcome the contradictions between the rapid
   pace of development of science, technology and processes of designing
   new software systems.},

Abstract = {Any product, especially those with safety features or concerns, is
   normally subject to compliance audit with various standards and legal
   requirements at different stages throughout its lifecycle. These
   requirements are typically conveyed in voluminous written natural
   language texts requiring much expert interpretation. The compliance
   audit process has conventionally been a manual undertaking, which is
   known to be laborious, costly, and error-prone. In an era of increased
   legislation and electronic representations of products, it is prudent
   that some of these manual processes should be automated. This paper
   describes the capabilities of an automated compliance audit framework
   that can be incorporated into the compliance management of a product
   lifecycle. Apart from the product data model that is subject to audit,
   essential components of the framework include machine-readable legal
   knowledge and executable audit process models, support for supplementary
   human input and interface with simulation tools.},

Abstract = {This study aims to compare the technological solutions that can
   contribute to more sustainable energy use in the residential sector.
   Specifically, the goal of the study is to evaluate the environmental
   impact of different energy (heat and electricity) supply technologies
   applicable for an average size single-family building in Latvia, a
   country known for climatic condition characterized by cold winters with
   frequent snowfall. The study applies the lifecycle assessment
   methodology of ISO 14040 and the impact assessment method known as
   ReCiPe 2016 v1.1, which has not been used before for the scope addressed
   in the study in the context of single-family building energy supply
   technologies for climatic conditions in Latvia. Thus, the results of the
   study will provide new information for more sustainable energy solutions
   in this area of study. The technologies included in the defined
   scenarios are conventional boiler, electricity from the grid, Stirling
   engine, and solar photovoltaics (PV). The results of the lifecycle
   impact assessment for damage categories revealed that all scenarios have
   a high impact on human health due to fine particulate matter formation
   followed by global warming. Regarding the damage to the ecosystem, the
   terrestrial ecotoxicity category has highest impact, followed by global
   warming. Sensitivity analyses affirmed the model's validity and also
   showed that the impacts of conventional systems were most sensitive to
   changes in electricity consumption, and therefore, the scenarios with
   electricity supply from a Stirling engine or PV can be considered a more
   robust solution under changing electricity demands from an environmental
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Cells define the minimal building blocks of life. How cellular life
   emerged and evolved implies to cross the boundary between living and
   nonliving matter. Here we explore this problem by presenting several
   relevant components of the whole picture involving chemistry, physics
   and natural selection. Available evidence suggests that the basic logic
   of life can be understood and eventually translated into synthetic forms
   of cellular life. A simple, physically sound model of information-free
   protocell replication suggests that the basic logic of how to couple
   metabolism and container can be more relevant than the specific set of
   parameters used, thus indicating that the emergence of cells might have
   been easier than we would expect. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents a new conceptual model of the Universal Contemporary
   Information Center and its role both in supporting the individual
   development of people in the sustainable and harmonious development of
   society as a whole and community building. A key role in the concept of
   the model is the active use of the new information and communication
   technologies providing a timely and adequate response to the new
   information needs.
   Modern society is characterized by a qualitatively new attitude towards
   information. Information is recognized as the main resource for all
   areas - politics, economy, education, health, culture, etc. The change
   process covers the whole spectrum of social life; it is ubiquitous and
   irreversible. Changes in the environment have created the need to create
   modern information institutions that meet a variety of personal and
   community needs including the creation of communities.
   The Contemporary Information Center presented in this report reflects
   the demands and recommendations declared by the UN and IFLA in the UN
   Declaration on ``Transforming our World: the 2030 Sustainable
   Development Program{''} and the IFLA Strategic Plan 2016- 2021. The main
   objective of the second document is to determine the direction and way
   in which libraries and information institutions can participate and
   contribute to the transformation and sustainable development of the
   world in which we live.
   All these changes in the social and information environment, the new
   expectations of the users towards the library institutions give us a
   reason to offer a conceptual model of the library as a universal
   contemporary information center. The aim here is not to examine the
   structure and interconnections between the elements within the library
   exhaustively, but to specify its new structural and functional
   characteristics, tailored to the external environment and its relations
   with the other systems it interacts with. Its realization, in compliance
   with the changed conditions of the external environment, implies a
   significant change of the activities and the methods for their
   implementation. Generally speaking, the mission of libraries is to
   provide information that is adequate to the needs of society. In order
   to meet the real needs of information and services, the library has to
   come out of the traditional frameworks and enrich and develop both the
   resources provided and the activities carried out.
   Each Universal Contemporary Information Center, based on the proposed
   concept, could play a significant role not only in the information and
   educational provision of society but also in building communities within
   it.},

Title = {Roles of artificial intelligence in construction engineering and
   management: A critical review and future trends},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI),
   construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid
   digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the
   current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In
   this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both
   scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of
   AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research
   trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore
   the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473
   journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been
   an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along
   with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building
   information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief
   understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the
   emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high
   efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have
   been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in
   CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2)
   information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language
   processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The
   goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a
   data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex
   project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key
   directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual
   and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things
   (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to
   constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper intends to establish a model for the service life prediction
   of natural stone claddings with indirect fastening system based on a
   survey of the degradation state of 142 buildings in the Lisbon area. The
   state of degradation is evaluated through visual inspections that allow
   describing the extent of the cladding area affected by the different
   anomalies, thereby enabling the level of severity of the anomalies
   detected to be established. A numerical index of the degradation
   severity of stone claddings (Sw) is established; this is intended to
   express the global degradation level of these claddings, thus allowing
   the study of the evolution of their degradation with time to estimate a
   reference service life of this type of cladding. The results achieved in
   this study allow analyzing the influence of some intrinsic and extrinsic
   characteristics on the durability and service life of natural stone
   claddings with indirect fastening system. The information provided by
   the proposed models is essential for the definition of maintenance
   strategies, promoting a rational and sustainable management of the built
   heritage, optimizing the use of resources, and minimizing the overall
   cost of the building over its lifecycle.},

Abstract = {With the development of IoT, virtual reality, cloud computing, and
   digital twin technologies, the advent of metaverse has attracted
   increasing world attention. Metaverse integrates and applies multiple
   emerging technologies to cloud education, smart health, digital
   government, and emergency evacuation. Evacuation systems are of great
   importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may
   not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to
   leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a
   branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model
   an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd
   distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a
   path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through
   dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this
   article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency
   evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system
   built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most
   efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The
   information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and
   smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building
   in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers
   in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees.
   Experiments in different simulation scenes demonstrate that the proposed
   method is superior to the traditional static guidance method in saving
   evacuation time. It can effectively avoid major crowding along the
   evacuation route and improve evacuation efficiency.},

Abstract = {This paper will present a model that uses the Supply-Chain Operations
   Reference (SCOR) model as a foundation for a framework to illustrate the
   information needed throughout a product lifecycle to support a healthy
   supply chain management function and the subsequent contract
   requirements to enable it. It will also show where in the supply chain
   the information must be extracted. The ongoing case study used to
   exemplify the model is NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration) Ares I program for human spaceflight.
   Effective supply chain management and contract requirements are ongoing
   opportunities for continuous improvement within government agencies,
   specifically development of systems for human spaceflight operations.
   Multiple reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
   reinforce this importance. {[}1]-{[}5]
   The SCOR model is a framework for describing a supply chain with process
   building blocks and business activities. It provides a set of metrics
   for measuring supply chain performance and best practices for
   continuously improving. This paper expands the application of the SCOR
   to also provide the framework for defining information needed from
   different levels of the supply chain and at different phases of the
   lifecycle. These needs can be incorporated into contracts to enable more
   effective supply chain management. Depending on the phase of the
   lifecycle, effective supply chain management will require involvement
   from different levels of the organization and different levels of the
   supply chain. (12)},

Abstract = {In this chapter, an integrated approach for a holistic (involving
   notions of safety, resiliency and sustainability) building design is
   presented to select the optimal design alternative based on multiple
   conflicting criteria under uncertainty. A probabilistic framework of the
   Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) is adopted, where MAUT is
   developed in conjunction with Performance-Based Engineering (PBE)
   approach, giving rise to a general framework, namely the PBE-MAUT. In
   PBE-MAUTdifferent design alternatives may be ranked based on the
   expected utility. The discrepancies from the expected utility theory may
   be modelled through a risk-averse modelling of the utility functions
   based on the individual perceptions, or a more detailed description of
   the consequences valuable to the decision makers. Moreover, a
   risk-averse decision-maker towards extreme events can consider suitable
   quantiles or superquantiles. The distribution of the utility function is
   obtained from the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) which, through
   the design point, gives also the most critical realizations of the
   consequences for different degrees of risk aversion. The decision-making
   process is dynamic, in the sense that the optimal decision changes
   accordingly when new information is available. Such dynamic behavior is
   effectively represented using the Bayesian analysis, here modeled by
   combining PBE-MAUT with the Bayesian Network (BN). In this manner, the
   proposed framework represents a powerful Decision Support Tool (DST) for
   holistic building design. The BN, in conjunction with an array of
   sensors, can also be effectively used to determine the multi-criteria
   optimal decision considering the building lifecycle for a sustainable
   and resilient building design. The key features of the DST are
   demonstrated by an application to an office located on the Create
   Building, in Singapore.},

Title = {Independent mitochondrial and nuclear exchanges arising in
   <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> crossed-isolates support the presence of
   a mitochondrial segregation mechanism},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are members of the phylum
   Glomeromycota, an early divergent fungal lineage that forms symbiotic
   associations with the large majority of land plants. These organisms are
   asexual obligate biotrophs, meaning that they cannot complete their life
   cycle in the absence of a suitable host. These fungi can exchange
   genetic information through hyphal fusions (i.e. anastomosis) with
   genetically compatible isolates belonging to the same species. The
   occurrence of transient mitochondrial length-heteroplasmy through
   anastomosis between geographically distant Rhizophagus irregularis
   isolates was previously demonstrated in single spores resulting from
   crossing experiments. However, (1) the persistence of this phenomenon in
   monosporal culture lines from crossed parental isolates, (2) its
   correlation with nuclear exchanges and (3) the potential mechanisms
   responsible for mitochondrial inheritance are still unknown. Using the
   AMF model organism R. irregularis, we tested whether the presence of a
   heteroplasmic state in progeny spores was linked to the occurrence of
   nuclear exchanges and whether the previously observed heteroplasmic
   state persisted in monosporal in vitro crossed-culture lines. We also
   investigated the presence of a putative mitochondrial segregation
   apparatus in Glomeromycota by identifying proteins similar to those
   found in other fungal groups.
   Results: We observed the occurrence of biparental inheritance both for
   mitochondrial and nuclear markers tested in single spores obtained from
   crossed-isolates. However, only one parental mitochondrial DNA and
   nuclear genotype were recovered in each monosporal crossed-cultures,
   with an overrepresentation of certain mitochondrial haplotypes. These
   results strongly support the presence of a nuclear-independent
   mitochondrial segregation mechanism in R. irregularis. Furthermore, a
   nearly complete set of genes was identified with putative orthology to
   those found in other fungi and known to be associated with the
   mitochondrial segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and filamentous
   fungi.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mitochondrial segregation might
   take place either during spore formation or colony development and that
   it might be independent of the nuclear segregation machinery. We present
   the basic building blocks for a better understanding of the
   mitochondrial inheritance process and segregation in these important
   symbiotic fungi. The comprehension of these processes is of great
   importance since it has been shown that different segregated lines of
   the same isolate can have variable effects on the host plant.},

Title = {Digital Twins in the Construction Industry: A Perspective of
   Practitioners and Building Authority},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {As the notion of data-driven analytics and turning data into action is
   becoming more salient in the construction industry, researchers and
   practitioners have recently devoted considerable effort to investigate
   the digital transformation of the industry. Along this journey, Digital
   Twin has been introduced to the industry as a concept that holds the
   promise to challenge the status-quo and address long standing problems
   of productivity, efficiency, and value. While this concept is becoming
   more familiar among practitioners, there is a lack of universal
   definitions of what the Digital Twin of a construction project is.
   Additionally, while identifying the purpose of Digital Twin is
   recognized as the first step in implementing Digital Twins, there is
   little discussion on the perception of construction practitioners of the
   extent to which Digital Twin can deliver value. To address these
   research gaps and building on the existing work on Digital Twins in the
   context of the construction industry, this paper first proposes a
   definition of the Digital Twin of a construction project. Next, a series
   of semi-structured interviews are conducted with nine construction
   practitioners to understand their perceptions on the use and challenges
   of Digital Twins. Thematic analysis is then used to analyze interview
   data and summarize Digital Twins applications, capabilities, and
   challenges. Forty direct applications were identified and grouped into
   seven capabilities. Digital Twins capabilities of Increase Transparency
   of Information and Real-Time Monitoring, Analysis, and Feedback were the
   most discussed with a total of eight applications each, followed by
   Better Stakeholder Collaboration which had seven applications. The
   discussion on challenges led to the identification of 34 challenges to
   implementing Digital Twin, grouped into six categories coded through
   thematic analysis. The category on Data Understanding, Preparation, and
   Usage Challenges was found to be the most critical for the interviewees.
   Additionally, the paper presents a case study on how building authority
   can be integrated into Digital Twins and leverage its use throughout the
   lifecycle of a building. Future work can further investigate the
   challenges and develop prototypes that can help in quantifying the
   benefits of implementing Digital Twins on a Construction Project.},

Title = {A Decentralized Approach for Modeling Organized Convection Based on
   Thermal Populations on Microgrids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, a spectral model for convective transport is coupled to a
   thermal population model on a two-dimensional horizontal
   ``microgrid,{''} covering the typical gridbox size of general
   circulation models. The goal is to explore new ways of representing
   impacts of spatial organization in cumulus cloud fields. The thermals
   are considered the smallest building block of convection, with thermal
   life cycle and movement represented through binomial functions. Thermals
   interact through two simple rules, reflecting pulsating growth and
   environmental deformation. Long-lived thermal clusters thus form on the
   microgrid, exhibiting scale growth and spacing that represent simple
   forms of spatial organization and memory. Size distributions of cluster
   number are diagnosed from the microgrid through an online clustering
   algorithm, and provided as input to a spectral multiplume
   eddy-diffusivity mass flux scheme. This yields a decentralized transport
   system, in that the thermal clusters acting as independent but
   interacting nodes that carry information about spatial structure. The
   main objectives of this study are (a) to seek proof of concept of this
   approach, and (b) to gain insight into impacts of spatial organization
   on convective transport. Single-column model experiments demonstrate
   satisfactory skill in reproducing two observed cases of continental
   shallow convection. Metrics expressing self-organization and spatial
   organization match well with large-eddy simulation results. We find that
   in this coupled system, spatial organization impacts convective
   transport primarily through the scale break in the size distribution of
   cluster number. The rooting of saturated plumes in the subcloud mixed
   layer plays a key role in this process.
   Plain Language Summary Recent studies have emphasized the importance of
   the spatial structure of convective cloud fields in Earth's climate, yet
   this phenomenon is not yet represented well in Earth System Models
   (ESMs). This study explores a new way to achieve this goal, by
   considering spatial organization at the scale of small bubbles of rising
   air called thermals that together make up convective clouds. Populations
   of interacting thermals are modeled in a computationally efficient way
   on a small two-dimensional grid. This microgrid is then coupled to a
   convection scheme, which stands for the set of equations used to
   statistically represent the impact of convective transport at scales
   that remain unresolved in ESMs. The coupling makes the scheme
   decentralized, in that the transport becomes dependent on a population
   of longer-lived convective structures that slowly develop and evolve on
   the microgrid. The new scheme is tested for observed conditions at a
   meteorological site in the Southern Great Plains area of the United
   States, making use of a combination of high-resolution simulations and
   measurements to evaluate performance. Apart from proof of concept for
   the new modeling approach, the results provide new insights into how the
   spatial structure of convective cloud populations can affect its
   vertical transport.},

Title = {Energy Modelling as a Trigger for Energy Communities: A Joint
   Socio-Technical Perspective},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mainstreaming energy communities has been one of the main challenges in
   the low-carbon transition of cities. In this sense, urban building
   energy modelling (UBEM) has an untapped role in enabling energy
   communities, as simulations on urban models provide evidence-based
   decision support to reduce risks, engage, motivate and guide actors,
   assert wider policy goals and regulatory requirements. This accelerating
   role and the potential of UBEM is not sufficiently understood, as
   research into energy community focuses on its barriers and impacts,
   while the research of UBEM is mainly technologically oriented. This
   review takes a sociotechnical approach to explore whether UBEM is a
   technological trigger for energy communities, furthering the conceptual
   framework of transition management. factors influencing energy community
   progression in different use-cases and stages of their lifecycle are
   compiled to assess the affordances of distinct capabilities of prevalent
   UBEM tools. The study provides a guide for energy community planners to
   UBEM. It matches different tool capabilities to the various stages of
   the project lifecycle for the different use-cases, equipping them with
   the means to accelerate the low-carbon transition of cities from the
   bottom-up. Finally, the study defines a development trajectory oriented
   towards application in urban sustainability to a rather new UBEM field.},

Title = {Analysis and GIS Mapping of Flooding Hazards on 10 May 2016, Guangzhou,
   China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {On 10 May 2016, Guangdong Province, China, suffered a heavy rainstorm.
   This rainstorm flooded the whole city of Guangzhou. More than 100,000
   people were affected by the flooding, in which eight people lost their
   lives. Subway stations, cars, and buses were submerged. In order to
   analyse the influential factors of this flooding, topographical
   characteristics were mapped using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) by the
   Geographical Information System (GIS) and meteorological conditions were
   statistically summarised at both the whole city level and the district
   level. To analyse the relationship between flood risk and urbanization,
   GIS was also adopted to map the effect of the subway system using the
   Multiple Buffer operator over the flooding distribution area. Based on
   the analyses, one of the significant influential factors of flooding was
   identified as the urbanization degree, e.g., construction of a subway
   system, which forms along flood-prone areas. The total economic loss due
   to flooding in city centers with high urbanization has become very
   serious. Based on the analyses, the traditional standard of severity of
   flooding hazards (rainfall intensity grade) was modified. Rainfall
   intensity for severity flooding was decreased from 50 mm to 30 mm in
   urbanized city centers. In order to protect cities from flooding, a
   ``Sponge City{''} planning approach is recommended to increase the
   temporary water storage capacity during heavy rainstorms. In addition,
   for future city management, the combined use of GIS and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) is recommended to evaluate flooding hazards.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development is an inclusive concept, which has, among other
   things, significance for the shaping of architecture and urban planning
   assumptions related to the principles of sustainable design. They
   include the need to respect the land, care for present and future
   generations, rational management of the natural resources, energy
   efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources. The indicated
   attitude in the field of project activity is vital for its effect, which
   directly influences the comfort of living and social satisfaction, so
   important for the success of the investment. Sustainable design requires
   expressing the concern the natural environment, which is an inseparable
   part of the human habitat. It affects the comfort of living, the shape
   of pro-health conditions, and also has a positive effect on the
   psychological wellbeing of a person. The study aims to assess the impact
   of the climatic conditions on the quality of residential areas. Rational
   use of the characteristic features of climatic zones and the conditions
   that are associated with them determine the improvement of the quality
   of the built environment shaped by the man Climatic factors such as
   solar radiation, temperature, air circulation and air humidity are
   essential for low-energy building, whose indicators depend on the use of
   appropriate technologies and materials as well as on natural factors
   such as climatic features. The object - in its full life cycle, taking
   into account its parameters or the energy demand, is controlled by the
   BIM standard, which gains an ever-growing number of supporters. It is
   also a technology obligatory in many countries, applied in the field of
   design practice, which is of particular importance for facilities with
   large cubic capacity. Control over bigger structures allows to minimise
   errors in the functioning of the facilities or plan the costs associated
   with their maintenance, including scheduled repairs and modernisation.
   BIM is particularly useful for controlling energy indicators of the
   facilities, whose sizes depend on the relationship between the natural
   environment and the constructed one. The analysis of the indicated
   compounds allows to formulate guidelines useful at particular stages of
   shaping housing development, and thus forming buildings and urban
   spaces. Variable meteorological factors are possible to be defined by
   conditions allowing the determination of climatic zones with their
   characteristic features. The degree of solar radiation depends on: the
   state of the atmosphere, the properties of the ground and other
   surfaces, the geometric layout of the considered urban interior
   including biologically active areas, population density, the size of the
   city, and the extent of its industrialisation. The temperature is also
   influenced by the size of the urban centre and the developed areas,
   population, the morphology of the place and accompanying meteorological
   factors (cloudiness, windfall). The article presents the influence of
   the insolation on the architectural object and housing conditions. It
   should be emphasised that solar radiation is necessary for the physical
   and biological processes on Earth, essential for human life. In
   addition, the energy of radiation is obtained without inputs associated
   with the source of the origin. Therefore it is crucial for spatial
   planning, conditioning proper lighting of urban interiors and promoting
   thermal comfort in places of residence, using a natural source of heat.},

Abstract = {The digital twin (DT) is a virtual replica of real-world buildings,
   processes, structures, people, and systems created and maintained to
   answer questions about its physical part, the physical twin (PT). In the
   case of the built environment, the PT is represented by smart buildings
   and infrastructures. Full synchronization between the DT and the PT will
   allow for a perpetual learning process and updating between the two
   twins. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of DT called
   risk-informed digital twin (RDT). In the DT the model predictions are
   developed through data-driven tools and algorithms. However, multiple
   sources of uncertainty during the lifecycle challenge our understanding
   and ability to effectively model the performance of the modeled systems.
   The RDT's importance lies in its integration of the methods and tools of
   statistics and risk analysis with machine learning. To this aim, the
   platform incorporates a novel framework of data-driven uncertainty
   quantification and risk analysis rooted in information theory. At the
   core of the RDT is a framework of sustainable and resilient based
   engineering (SRBE), introduced in this work and considered the first
   step toward the extension of performance-based engineering (PBE)
   approaches to socioecological-technical systems under uncertainty. A
   risk-informed multicriteria decision support tool able to incorporate
   social aspects is also included, and it can be used for sustainable and
   resilient design in the early stage, or management under uncertainty of
   smart buildings and infrastructure systems. (C) 2022 American Society of

Abstract = {Climate change has become a major area of concern over the past few
   years and consequently many governments, international bodies,
   businesses, and institutions are taking measures to reduce their carbon
   footprint. However, to date very little research has taken place on
   information and sustainable development in general, and on the
   environmental impact of information services in particular. Based on the
   data collected from various research papers and reports, this review
   article shows that information systems and services for the higher
   education and research sector currently generate massive greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, and it is argued that there is an urgent need for
   developing a green information service, or green IS in short, that
   should be based on minimum GHG emissions throughout its lifecycle, from
   content creation to distribution, access, use, and disposal. Based on an
   analysis of the current research on green information technology (IT),
   it is proposed that a green IS should be based on the model of cloud
   computing. Finally, a research agenda is proposed that will pave the way
   for building and managing green ISs to support education and

   These limitations have motivated recent interest in alternative
   approaches such as business artefact modelling that provide a unified
   representation of data and processes in the form of business artifacts.
   In this paper we describe the Unicorn Universe Process method that uses
   business artifacts as a fundamental building block of information
   systems. We illustrate the application of this method using a University
   Assignment Submission case study scenario.},

Abstract = {Purpose The improper maintenance affects the performance of management
   practices for Green Building (GB) in Malaysia. This is due to the issues
   of lack of GB knowledge and competency for maintenance activities in GB
   projects. However, only a few researchers have investigated maintenance
   within the GBs. This may be due to industry's lack of awareness
   concerning the currently existing maintenance problems and their causes.
   The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This
   paper intends to develop a new Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) based approach for managing maintenance in GB schemes. As a
   precursor to this work, the current maintenance management activities,
   ICT tools and techniques are reviewed and explored in such projects to
   gather processes and information database of maintenance and management.
   Findings The findings reveal the need for more sophisticated maintenance
   management solutions that accord with the needs of GB schemes to manage
   quality and reduce associated defects. Originality/value The paper
   concludes by presenting a research framework for developing such a
   system in the future. It is also suggested that further research into
   maintenance of GB should consider issues in terms of concern for
   lifecycle assessment and sustainability.},

   construction projects},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {221-232},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The construction sector ranks among those with the highest accident
   rates. The incorporation of Health and Safety (H\&S) concepts in a
   construction project has the potential to minimize accident rates and to
   reduce project costs. However, these concepts must be fully incorporated
   throughout the building lifecycle: design, construction, useful life,
   and reintegration. Attention should be paid to the initial design phase,
   because of its greater impact on accident reduction.
   In response to this reality, a mathematical model has been developed for
   decision-taking purposes using multi-criteria analysis. It is
   hierarchically structured in accordance with the four lifecycle phases
   of a building (design, construction, useful life, and reintegration).
   The present research is of relevance to ensure that H\&S matters are
   effectively and properly integrated into management projects, through
   the use of a methodology at the design stage that grades sustainability
   from low to high on a rising scale of 0-1.
   The Health and Safety Costs Index (H\&SC Index) is presented as a second
   index, based on economic criteria, that quantifies the first index in
   economic terms. Both indices are empirically related by an exponential
   function. The model is validated through its application to two
   alternative construction design projects for industrial premises. (C)

Title = {Transformation of the AECO industry through the metaverse: potentials
   and challenges},
Journal = {DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {The integration of the metaverse into the real estate and construction
   industry reveals various potentials, but also challenges. The increasing
   digitization in the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   operation (AECO) sector requires a critical examination of aspects such
   as the metaverse. This paper is dedicated to examining the impact of the
   metaverse on the real estate and construction industry. The following
   specialist article is primarily aimed at the target group of the AECO
   sector, with the aim of gaining an initial overview of the opinions
   within this sector. The methodology used includes an in-depth literature
   review and a representative survey. Respondents from different age
   groups and areas of activity within the construction and real estate
   industry took part in this survey. The research questions of this paper
   are aimed at identifying the range of metaverse applications in the AECO
   industry, assessing their potential impact on business potential and
   challenges. The aim is to develop initial definitions and use cases and
   to create an overview of opinions in the industry. In this context,
   potential opportunities and risks will be examined to derive
   recommendations for an effective integration of the metaverse into the
   AECO industry. The results of this paper conducted indicate that there
   is still considerable uncertainty in the construction and real estate
   industry. It appears that the term ``metaverse{''} and the associated
   potential through targeted use cases are not yet widespread in this
   industry. The survey participants recognize a potential for 3D
   visualizations in the metaverse that extends over the entire life cycle
   of buildings. An exemplary scenario for this is the use of 3D
   visualizations both during the planning phase and in marketing. The
   challenges identified shed light on uncertainties relating to data
   protection, privacy, and the influence of the internet. The results of
   the study reveal a high level of uncertainty and ignorance within the
   industry when it comes to understanding the metaverse. Based on the
   results, further studies are needed to establish the understanding and
   real potential of the metaverse in the industry. Conducting workshops
   specifically aimed at the AECO sector can help to deepen understanding
   of the potential of possible use cases.
   Analysis of potentials and challenges of metaverse in architecture,
   engineering, construction, and operations (AECO)Methodology comprises
   literature review, workshops and a representative surveyResults show a
   high level of uncertainty and ignorance of the construction industry

Abstract = {Software traceability provides a means for capturing the relationship
   between artifacts at all phases of software and systems development. The
   relationships between the artifacts that are generated during systems
   development can provide valuable information for software and systems
   Engineers. It can be used for change impact analysis, systems
   verification and validation, among other things. However, there is no
   consensus among researchers about the syntax or semantics of trace links
   across multiple domains. Moreover, existing trace links classifications
   do not consider a unified method for combining all trace links types in
   one taxonomy that can be utilized in Requirement Engineering, Model
   Driven Engineering and Systems Engineering. This paper is one step
   towards solving this issue. We first present requirements that a trace
   links taxonomy should satisfy. Second, we present a technique to build a
   trace links taxonomy that has well-defined semantics. We implemented the
   taxonomy by employing the Link data and the Resource Description
   Framework (RDF). The taxonomy can be configured with traceability models
   using Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) in order to
   capture traceability information among different artifacts and at
   different levels of granularity. In addition, the taxonomy offers
   reasoning and quantitative and qualitative analysis about trace links.
   We presented validation criteria for validating the taxonomy
   requirements and validate the solution through an example.},

Title = {Circular information flows in industrialized housing construction: the

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1354-1379},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to conduct a qualitative assessment of synergies
   between information flows of a multifamily product platform used for
   industrialized housing and materials passports that can promote a
   circular economy in the construction industry.
   Design/methodology/approachUsing a single case study method, the
   research assesses the availability and accessibility of materials
   passport-relevant information generated by a leading Swedish
   industrialized housing construction firm. Data is collected using
   semistructured interviews, document analysis and an extended research
   visit. FindingsThe research findings identify the functional layers of
   the product platform, map the information flow using a process diagram,
   assess the availability and accessibility of material passport relevant
   information by lifecycle stage and actor, and summarize the key points
   using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)
   analysis. Research limitations/implicationsThe three main implications
   are: the technical and process platforms used in industrialized
   construction allow for generating standardized, digital and reusable
   information; the vertical integration of trades and long-term
   relationships with suppliers improve transparency and reduce
   fragmentation in information flows; and the design-build-operate
   business model strategy incentivizes actors to manage information flows
   in the use phase. Practical implicationsIndustrialized construction
   firms can use this paper as an approach to understand and map their
   information flows to identify suitable approaches to generate and manage
   materials passports. Originality/valueThe specific characteristics of
   product platforms and industrialized construction provide a unique
   opportunity for circular information flow across the building lifecycle,
   which can support material passport adoption to a degree not often found
   in the traditional construction industry.},

Title = {Architectural heritage knowledge modelling: An ontology- based framework
   for conservation process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {124-133},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents an ontology-based model to support the
   representation and management of information and knowledge during
   investigation activities for the conservation of architectural heritage.
   Despite the significant impact of information and communications
   technology (ICT) on architectural heritage, current approaches to its
   use in this context are often conceived only to provide flexible and
   reusable tools and methodologies, thus proposing oversimplified
   procedures that are ultimately insufficient for a truly accurate
   conservation project. A few experiences recently have focused much
   attention on the specifics of conservation. Although they have generally
   been concerned with the specific activities and knowledge domains
   related to conservation processes (such as cataloguing or monument
   damage), the importance of dealing with them in an integrated way is
   often neglected. Hence, each step of the process - such as the
   preliminary phase of knowledge acquisition, the summaries, which
   facilitate the assessment of value, diagnostics, design, the
   construction phase, and maintenance- is treated in isolation from all
   the other activities. This lack of synergy often compromises the final
   result. In order to deal with the complexity of representing historical
   architecture, and its conservation process, this proposed model defines
   four main knowledge domains (artefact- lifecycle- architectural heritage
   investigation process- actors), in which all the knowledge related to
   each artefact is formalized through semantic networks, in terms of
   entities, properties and relationships. Specific reasoning and inference
   rules allow checking of the model for coherence, in order to reduce
   information discrepancies, inconsistencies and errors. The proposed
   model offers a high level of accuracy in its capacity for description
   and, at the same time, a broad versatility within representation
   modelling, allowing such a reliable representation of multiple issues
   that eventually it may be required for every historical building,
   depending on its features and state of conservation. Moreover, the
   versatility of the model provides a suitable representation even for the
   different nature of the investigation activities results- whether
   analytical or hermeneutical. Finally, the knowledgebase has been
   connected with a building information modelling environment, providing
   an effective integration between geometrical and non-geometrical
   information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (FM) industries have been applying various emerging
   digital technologies to facilitate the design, construction, and
   management of infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged
   as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer,
   analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM.
   Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past
   decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on
   DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct
   bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and
   co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors,
   sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are
   identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM
   focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber-physical
   system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management.
   Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health
   management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep
   learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically
   rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and
   autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review
   contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart
   FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and
   future needs with regard to DT in FM.},

Title = {Experience and challenges of long-term performance research on asphalt
   pavement},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Number = {30},
Pages = {3228-3237},
Abstract = {The long-term performance of China's asphalt roads has exhibited
   significant improvements in the past decades. The material-performance
   testing methods are being gradually established, the structural
   thickness-design method has been constructed, and construction
   technologies and quality-control methods have been developed.
   Additionally, hundreds of field-test sections were monitored, and
   accelerated-loading tests were conducted to identify the significant
   determinants that could potentially affect field performance, including
   the surface friction, permanent deformation, transverse crack, and
   fatigue crack. Field-distress-detection method and equipment have been
   developed to quickly obtain the performance information and provide
   critical feedbacks to road designers. The mechanisms that correspond to
   the most observed distresses in China were explored, and predictive
   models with varied performance in field roads were accordingly developed
   and validated. Road maintenance strategies were established, and
   materials that fit the varied field distresses were developed to improve
   maintenance quality. Despite the aforementioned efforts, asphalt
   pavements in different regions in China exhibit dramatically varying
   service lives, and we can see that the service life of roads is commonly
   lower than the design life. The main reasons are that the long-term
   performance studies mostly concentrated on small-scale test sections
   that could not fully represent the full-scale field-pavement sections,
   and the field test of roads were too concentrated in specific areas to
   include the effects of key parameters such as the variation in climatic
   conditions, traffic loads, water table, and local material properties.
   Furthermore, most research lacked national-level coordination and
   planning with short time duration, and obtaining the research reports
   online was difficult. In addition, the long-term performance-prediction
   models relied more on laboratory tests and lacked diversity and
   continuity. They were limited to single environmental factor, mismatched
   traffic loads and actual conditions, limited simulation of
   long-term-failure forms, and insufficient field validation. Thus, using
   these models as a guide to effectively design pavements with reasonable
   durability is difficult. In general, the long-term performance research
   of asphalt pavement in China has good preliminary foundations, and most
   policy makers and researchers possess the enthusiasm and confidence to
   design and construct better roads. However, many challenges remain be
   solved in terms of performance prediction with higher prediction
   accuracy, research orientation, research duration, all-round continuous
   observation, data quality control and standardization, and establishment
   of open database. We recommend carrying out nationwide deep-level,
   large-scale, and long-term pavement-performance observation as well as
   prediction research.
   The main subjects of these studies include but are not limited to the
   following: (1) Scaling to supplement and improve nationwide long-term
   performance field projects based on existing research and layout; (2)
   building a national unified, continuous, and long-term
   performance-observation network; (3) establishing a road life-cycle
   standardized database that includes design information, raw-material
   resource, construction procedure, service condition, and maintenance
   strategy and effectiveness; and (4) constructing performance prediction
   models that consider both mechanical calculated response (i.e., stress
   and strain) and statistical analysis, factors that cover climatic
   condition (i.e., environmental factors from different areas), traffic
   loads, structural thickness, and materials.},

   The framework is applicable in great generality and accounts for
   different sources of MR during the entire lifecycle of a model. The aim
   of this paper is to extend the framework in {[}5] by studying its
   relation with the uncertainty associated to the data used for building
   the model. We define a metric on the space of samples in order to
   measure the data intrinsic distance, providing a novel way to probe the
   data for insight, allowing us to work on the sample space, gain business
   intuition and access tools such as perturbation methods.},

   projects, studies, reports, and surveys, commissioned at a national and
   European level, as well as a wide consultation with Construction
   industry key players across Europe. The ROADCON ICT vision, established
   from the synthesized industrial requirements, has been expressed using
   the following attributes: human centered ICT, flexible interoperability,
   performance driven process, virtual teams, adaptive systems, total
   lifecycle, knowledge re-use, ambient access, model-based ICT, and
   intelligent products and buildings. It is worth mentioning that the ICT
   dedicated vision presented in this paper (that complies with the scope
   of ROADCON) contributes to a wider vision, which is the one of smart
   buildings and sustainable cities. The former envisions future buildings
   to be self-configurable, functionally adaptable, remotely manageable,
   socially cohesive, human supportive, and environmental friendly; while
   the latter sees the dominance of the concept of urban ambient

Title = {Cybersecurity: From ad hoc patching to lifecycle of software engineering},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The role of information assurance (IA) is critical for cyber-based
   technologies and products, and the risk of cyberterrorism to IA is
   omnipresent. In particular, to achieve IA, young and dynamic developing
   technologies and products should be using a defined lifecycle that
   leverages and builds (throughout the developmental lifecycle) on a rich
   and proven body of knowledge and practices in risk assessment and
   management. The lifecycle of software development must include the
   following (not necessarily sequentially): the needs and requirements;
   specifications; contractor selection; conceptual design; systems
   integration, demonstration, and validation; engineering manufacturing,
   development, and production; and maintenance and major upgrade. In
   addition to addressing the functionality of the lifecycle development,
   from the risk analysis perspective it is just as important to focus on
   (1) the people's perspectives - namely, the individual, the team, the
   management, and the stakeholder, (2) the hardware-software perspectives,
   especially the risks associated with the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
   products and (3) the environment within which the entire system
   operates. This paper follows and builds on two papers previously
   published in this journal on the risks of terrorism associated with
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other
   cyberdependent systems. Its thesis is that the reliability and integrity
   of such systems, and thus, the corresponding interdependent
   infrastructures served by them, are contingent on the following three
   principles of IA and cybersecurity. Adhering to these principles can be
   instrumental in achieving the desired level of IA and cybersecurity:
   (1) Risk of software intrusion must be assessed and managed throughout
   the lifecycle of software development, focusing on both the
   functionality of software development and on the people involved in the
   process, knowing that hackers will exploit every weakness in the system.
   (2) Achieving information assurance and cybersecurity must be placed
   high on the priority list of top management. (The two are intricately
   dependent on software quality and telecommunications fidelity). This is
   synonymous with performing a holistic risk assessment and management.
   (3) Risk management of cyberterrorism must be the domain priority of the
   entire development team and the organization's management. It must be
   achieved from the perspectives of the total system throughout the
   software and system development's lifecycles.
   Building on the multifarious sources of risk envisioned during the
   lifecycle of software development through Hierarchical Holographic
   Modeling, resilience in cybersecurity through risk management is
   discussed. The human role in IA and cybersecurity and the centrality of
   the educational dimension in risk management are also introduced.},

Abstract = {In the Oya area of Utsunomiya City in Tochigi prefecture, because of the
   decline of the Oya-stone industry due to the rise of new construction
   materials and overseas production materials, abandoned agricultural
   lands and empty houses increased. However, recently in the Oya area,
   local government has tackled with the revitalization of the area
   utilizing abundant underground water of the Oyastone quarry, which was
   once a facility of Oya-stone industry. For example, the place in which
   groundwater is accumulated in the quarry is utilized for underground
   lake cruise. Also, attention has been recently paid to the fact that the
   average water temperature of the quarry groundwater is about 7 degrees
   lower than that of ordinal groundwater, and business projects utilizing
   the quarry groundwater as a heat source for heat exchange system have
   recently been promoted by local government. As well as those approaches
   for revitalization, local government of Utsunomiya city has been
   tackling with reuse of empty houses.
   Therefore, this study explores the possibility of region revitalization
   utilizing regional resources in the Oya area, evaluating proposed empty
   house utilization that makes use of the quarry groundwater as a heat
   source of heat exchange system from the viewpoint of environmental
   burden.
   In this study, we investigated buildings in the Oya area, and made a
   building information database. Assuming a case where a empty house is
   renovated and utilized as a restaurant that is short in Oya area, Eight
   buildings with different insulation performance and air conditioning
   method were modeled using the building information database. We
   evaluated the lifecycle CO2 emissions of those building models when
   utilized. As a result, it is estimated that about 70\% of CO2 emissions
   can be reduced by improving insulation performance and air conditioning
   system and by utilizing quarry groundwater as heat source of heat
   exchange system.},

Abstract = {Evaluating the value of a building is a complex matter in itself. With
   an ambition to evaluate the value of a building embedded in its
   surroundings, and with a wider societal perspective, the task becomes
   even more complex. A new conceptual evaluation model was introduced at
   the 8th Nordic conference in Tampere, 2015. The model is further
   developed and tested since then, and this paper gives an update on the
   results.
   The original model was based on principles from well-established
   evaluation methods and inspired by the OECD integrated evaluation model.
   It was made as simple as the authors found reasonable, considering the
   reduction in precision that comes with simplification. The authors
   tested the original model on three real-life case-projects in the
   development phase. Initial results proved promising, but also indicated
   issues for further development.
   After this initial development, the authors tested the model on two
   real-life building projects in parallel with testing a different
   evaluation model developed by Sweco Norway. The purpose of the two
   models are similar, but the methods have different takes on the process
   and what information is used as basis for evaluation. The direct
   comparison gave interesting findings and signals for further development
   of both models. Both models are developed in Norway and may be
   characterized as adapted to the Nordic context.
   The model evaluates the whole urban planning situation, including the
   neighborhood and transport infrastructure. The model has the potential
   to help practitioners achieve better results in terms of real
   sustainability in urban planning. Successful implementation and use of
   the model may lead to more conscious choices in urban planning and a
   more sustainable community.
   The authors also wanted to test the application of the tool as a
   self-assessment-tool, and one case study was conducted as self-study.
   And although the results clearly indicated that the tool need some
   improvements, the results shows that the method has a potential as a
   self-assessment-tool, for early phase decision making.},

Abstract = {In our country, fire from high-rise buildings happens from time to time
   and produced economic loss could be well over 100 billion that will give
   rise to great harm to safety of the people's life and property even to
   the development of the whole national economy. In the fire protection
   work for High-rise building's safety assessment, prevention, cause and
   salvation, all of this controlled by multiple factors. With their
   different attributes, fire problem and management work became more
   complex and even harder. When we want to integration and judgment the
   information which including many main bodies that with multi-aspect and
   evaluation index characteristics to be evaluated, Fuzzy mathematics
   evaluation method can help us. It can consider fully the fuzzy and
   uncertain in the assessment. For the problems in high-rise Building fire
   protection management. And it is frequently viewed as a multi-attribute
   group decision-making (MAGDM) issue. Thus, a novel MAGDM method is
   needed to tackle it. Depending on the conventional TOPSIS (Technique for
   Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method and
   intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), this essay designs a novel intuitive
   distance based IF-TOPSIS method for fire safety assessment based on the
   high building. Afterwards, relying on novel distance measures between
   IFNs, the conventional TOPSIS method is extended to the intuitionistic
   fuzzy environment to calculate assessment score of each alternative.
   Eventually, an application about fire safety assessment based on the
   high building and some comparative analysis have been given to
   demonstrate the superiority of the designed method. The results
   illustrate that the designed framework is useful for fire safety
   assessment based on the high building.},

Abstract = {The spreading of the Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) has involved new
   concepts in the management of construction projects generating a new
   demand for trained professionals with deep understanding of their
   principles and collaborative skills. In this order of ideas, a query
   arises as a non-negligible concern about how to teach and prepare
   students for this challenge. This paper presents a teaching and learning
   proposal for project development in the subject of final design project
   (8th-semester civil engineering-Universidad de los Andes), through the
   adoption of integrated project delivery (IPD) principles for their
   professional development through the project-based learning (PBL)
   methodology in accordance with the needs of the industry. The main
   objective of the course is to promote the professional and personal
   skills needed to thoroughly develop a design project, in order to solve
   a tangible social need identified in the municipalities and communities
   across the country and aligned with their development plans. It is a
   requirement that the students explicitly and holistically frame their
   project under the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic
   and environmental, and the project has to be ambitious enough so that it
   can involve all areas of the Civil Engineering program. The students
   develop and deliver the project in the real phases of the design
   lifecycle of an integrated civil project during the course: conceptual
   project, basic project, project draft, design project and the final
   deliverable which includes a complete and detailed
   descriptive-constructive memory, a complete design memory of all
   systems, the financial viability and construction schedule established
   to a high level of precision and a 3D BIM model with complete details.
   Students often take a step further and perform 4D and 5D simulations, as
   well as virtual reality applications. As a result, the students
   recognize the value of this methodology that allows a full rapprochement
   to a real world situation with innovative solutions and
   multidisciplinary teams.},

Abstract = {Materials database is widely used in materials science nowadays It can
   be used to manage the lifecycle of materials, to accomplish the material
   data sharing. and to save time and cost spending on experiments for
   users. However. since properties of materials are often affected by the
   constructed structures and their service environments, it is difficult
   to describe those properties properly by database
   Fortunately, the Logic Data Model is very helpful in describing and
   managing the whole lifecycle of materials, from the beginning of
   materials production, to structure construction, fill the failure of
   structure and materials. Usually, LDM describes data in three steps.
   Firstly. it collects data from different resources including experiment
   result data, basic scientific data (such as basic properties, structures
   and chemical composition, etc), regular numeric methods and information
   about their service environments, and so on Then, it organizes all the
   collected data using an object-oriented design method and unified logic
   language At last, the organized data is saved in a data warehouse using
   more abstract, more unified and stable structures Thus. it can support
   many, analysis methods, and build the former basis for realizing
   intelligent application, and suppose an efficient way to manage and
   analyze the experiment data
   This paper has built a LDM for the service safety evaluation of civil
   buildings This model is expressed by model-specified definition
   language, which has super classes, classes, objects and their
   interactions and constraints etc. Several super classes are derived from
   the procedure of the service safely evaluation They are Evaluation
   Objects (Interest Objects), Evaluation Activities, and Properties Thus,
   a network reflecting the elements' relationships we interested in, has
   become true It describes the logic relationships of data and supposes a
   background meaning to each data, which the LDM just works on
   This paper focuses on how to accomplish the LDM By using this model, the
   description of the data in materials database becomes very easy and
   simple Furthermore, properties of any materials can be traced properly,
   which is very important to batch processing the defected components},

Title = {A regression-based model for estimating the energy consumption of school
   facilities in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {A considerable amount of the oil used in Saudi Arabia is consumed to
   generate power. In an effort to minimize such consumption, the
   government of Saudi Arabia has established an ambitious part of the 2030
   Vision that includes 96 strategic objectives. In recent years, the
   advancement in information technology has made it possible to develop
   accurate prediction models of energy consumption for constructed
   facilities, which can assist with establishing plans to reduce future
   energy consumption. This research proposes a regression-based model for
   predicting the energy consumption of one of the most significant
   energy-consuming types of facilities in Saudi Arabia: schools. The model
   was developed utilizing 350 actual data points of energy consumption
   gathered from schools operating in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.
   The factors affecting consumption of energy were identified from two
   sources. The first was a review of the literature, and the second was
   interviews with local experts. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the
   most important factors (i.e., inputs/independent variables) affecting
   energy consumption (i.e., output) were AC capacity and building age. An
   investigation of the correlations among the independent variables
   revealed that the highest correlation of 0.864 was found between the
   total built area and total roof area. The developed model was validated
   using 35 new data points of school buildings across the eastern province
   of Saudi Arabia. The results show that the model predicted the energy
   consumption of school buildings with an accuracy higher than 90\%. The
   findings of this study will assist schools and maintenance managers in
   effectively managing such facilities by allowing them to allocate the
   required budget in advance. Also, the predictions can be used economic
   lifecycle analysis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Digital Transformation in the Construction Sector: A Digital Twin for
   Seismic Safety in the Lifecycle of Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The construction sector is currently undergoing a deep digital
   transformation resulting from the prioritization of emerging
   technologies, among which are digital twins. New goals and opportunities
   are appearing that minimize the impact on a building's lifecycle, reduce
   economic, environmental, and extra-social costs, optimize energetic
   performance, decrease energy consumption and emissions, and enhance the
   durability and service life of buildings and their components. Among the
   research activities that have led to the development of a maintenance
   management model (MMM), this paper deals with the digital-twin approach,
   considering it instrumental to the innovative governance of the building
   environment from a lifecycle-based and sustainable perspective. It
   includes paying attention to efficiency in terms of resource use, energy
   consumption, and the energy performance of buildings, supporting
   decarbonization processes, and environmental vulnerability due to
   natural disasters, extreme weather, and seismic events. Its current
   implementation is presented here. In this scenario, the authors,
   operating at BIG srl, an academic spinoff of the Mediterranean
   University of Reggio Calabria, Italy, working together with the startup
   Sysdev, based in Torino, Italy, the company Berna Engineering srl, based
   in Reggio Calabria, Italy, and ACCA Software spa, based in Avellino,
   Italy, introduce the experimental application of the DT4SEM for safety
   and well-being in buildings, which is specifically oriented to seismic
   behavior monitoring. The proposal, while highlighting the innovative
   character of DT approaches, responds to the need for reliable data for
   increasingly effective forecasts and the control of the seismic behavior
   of buildings, facilitating informed decision-making for building
   management while also optimizing maintenance schedules.},

Title = {Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Devices as a Use Case for Postmarketing
   Surveillance of Medical Devices},
Journal = {JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {183},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1090-1097},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is building a
   national postmarketing surveillance system for medical devices, moving
   to a ``total product life cycle{''} approach whereby more limited
   premarketing data are balanced with postmarketing surveillance to
   capture rare adverse events and long-term safety issues. OBJECTIVE To
   assess the methodological requirements and feasibility of postmarketing
   device surveillance using endovascular aneurysm repair devices (EVARs),
   which have been the subject of safety concerns, using clinical data from
   a large health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This
   retrospective cohort study included patients with electronic health
   record (EHR) data in the Veterans Affairs Corporate DataWarehouse.
   EXPOSURE Implantation of an AFX Endovascular AAA System (AFX) device
   (any of 3 iterations) or a non-AFX comparator EVAR device from January
   1, 2011, to December 21, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary
   outcomeswere rates of type III endoleaks and all-cause mortality; and
   rates of these outcomes associated with AFX devices compared with
   non-AFX devices, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression
   models and doubly robust causal modeling. Information on type III
   endoleaks was available only as free-text mentions in clinical notes,
   while all-cause mortality data could be extracted using structured data.
   Device-specific information required by the FDA is ascertained using
   unique device identifiers (UDIs), which include factors such as model
   numbers, catalog numbers, and manufacturer-specific product codes. The
   availability of UDIs in EHRs was assessed. RESULTS In total, 13 941
   patients (mean {[}SD] age, 71.8 {[}7.4] years) received 1 of the devices
   of interest (AFX with Strata {[}AFX-S]: 718 patients {[}5.2\%]; AFX with
   Duraply {[}AFX-D]: 404 patients {[}2.9\%]; or AFX2: 682 patients
   {[}4.9\%]), and 12 137 (87.1\%) received non-AFX devices. The UDIs were
   not recorded in the EHR for any patient with an AFX device, and partial
   UDIs were available for 19 patients (0.1\%) with a non-AFX device. This
   necessitated the development of advanced natural language processing
   tools to define the cohort of patients for analysis. The study
   identified a significantly higher risk of type III endoleaks at 5 years
   among patients receiving any of the AFX device iterations, including the
   most recent version, AFX2 (11.6\%; 95\% CI, 8.1\%-15.1\%) compared with
   that among patients with non-AFX devices (5.7\%; 95\% CI, 2.2\%-9.2\%;
   absolute risk difference, 5.9\%; 95\% CI, 2.3\%-9.4\%). However, there
   was no significantly higher all-cause mortality for any of the AFX
   device iterations, including for AFX2 (19.0\%; 95\% CI, 16.0\%-22.0\%)
   compared with non-AFX devices (18.0\%; 95\% CI, 15.0\%-21.0\%; absolute
   risk difference, 1.0\%; 95\% CI, -2.1\% to 4.1\%). CONCLUSIONS AND
   RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinical data
   can be used for the postmarketing device surveillance required by the
   FDA. The study also highlights ongoing challenges to performing
   larger-scale surveillance, including lack of consistent use of UDIs and
   insufficient relevant structured data to efficiently capture certain
   outcomes of interest.},

Abstract = {Analysis and design are important phases in the system development
   lifecycle. In these phases, developers record information necessary for
   properly understanding the nature of the systems under consideration.
   We consider a particular type of system, named Remote Lab that allows
   both teachers and students to perform real experiments over the internet
   and we focus on Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR).
   We describe a summarized web interface of VISIR using the Unified
   Modeling Language (UML). Our case study aims at identifying the
   requirements of VISIR and at creating a set of UML diagrams that
   succinctly provide enough information to both developers and users so
   that they acquire enough information for building a general
   understanding of it.
   Additionally, we provide elements for extending UML to better support
   further user interface development in VISIR.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, information and communication technologies (mobile phones,
   connected objects) strongly occupy our daily life. The increasing use of
   these technologies and the complexity of network infrastructures raise
   issues about radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (Rf-Emf) exposure.
   Most previous studies have assessed individual exposure to Rf-Emf, and
   the next level is to assess populational exposure. In our study, we
   designed a statistical tool for Rf-Emf populational exposure assessment
   and mapping. This tool integrates geographic databases and surrogate
   models to characterize spatiotemporal exposure from outdoor sources,
   indoor sources, and mobile phones. A case study was conducted on a 100 x
   100 m grid covering the 14th district of Paris to illustrate the
   functionalities of the tool. Whole-body specific absorption rate (SAR)
   values are 2.7 times higher than those for the whole brain. The mapping
   of whole-body and whole-brain SAR values shows a dichotomy between
   built-up and non-built-up areas, with the former displaying higher
   values. Maximum SAR values do not exceed 3.5 and 3.9 mW/kg for the whole
   body and the whole brain, respectively, thus they are significantly
   below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection
   (ICNIRP) recommendations. Indoor sources are the main contributor to
   populational exposure, followed by outdoor sources and mobile phones,
   which generally represents less than 1\% of total exposure.},

Abstract = {Evident boost in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   industry now is possible using BIM concept - Building Information
   Modelling. A similar workflow under a term Product Lifecycle Management
   (PLM) is known for quite a time. Successful introduction of these
   technologies require extensive application of 3D geometric models.
   Development of spatial imagination and 3D models by means of CAD systems
   should be tackled in the engineering courses. Universities have to
   participate more actively in the process of faster implementation of
   these technologies into life. A common background knowledge required to
   handle this problem is a development of spatial visualization skills
   since in the backbone of the both these concepts there is a
   three-dimensional (3D) geometric model or database. The former classic
   university courses like descriptive geometry and engineering graphics
   used in the last century have undergone considerable reduction in credit
   points, sometimes caused by administrative orders or experienced decent
   content changes dictated by IT achievements. However, development of the
   spatial comprehension and visualization skills should not be under
   estimated in the future syllabuses, because they are crucial for 3D
   modelling in a wide range of engineering applications. The paper will
   share an experience about recent research about teaching spatial
   comprehension, 3D visualization and CAD communication skills in
   technical universities. Results of the experience gained from a 2011
   Fulbright Scholarship teaching and research project about the measuring
   the engineering graphics literacy skills and further application in
   practice are represented as well. The paper will focus on a review of
   adopted and tested teaching methods and approaches rather than detailed
   analysis of the situation in general.},

Abstract = {IEC 62304 is a standard for the medical device software lifecycle.
   Developers must develop software that complies with all specifications
   in the standard for licensing. However, because the standard contains
   not only a large number of specifications, but also domain-specific
   information and association relationships between specifications, it
   requires considerable effort and time for developers to understand and
   interpret the standard. To support developers, this paper presents a
   method for extracting the contents of the IEC 62304 standard as a goal
   model, which is the core methodologies of requirements engineering. The
   proposed method analyzes the grammar of the standard to robustly extract
   complex structures and various information from standard specifications
   and define rules that extract goals and links from syntactic element
   units. We validated the actual extraction process for the standard
   document experimentally. Based on the extracted goal model, developers
   can intuitively and efficiently comply with the standard and track
   specific information within the medical software and standard domains.},

Title = {Automatic Generation of Pipelines Into a 3D Industrial Process Model},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {26591-26603},
Abstract = {Simulation has become an established technique to support the design of
   complex, mechatronic or cyber-physical systems. Ideally, simulations
   should already be performed at an early design phase before high-cost
   design commitments are made, and the recent advances in the
   digitalization of design information open possibilities for automatic
   generation of simulation models. However, high-fidelity simulation model
   building depends on accurate data. In particular, first-principles
   models are desirable source information for simulations, but such models
   generally are not available at an early design stage. This paper
   investigates the automatic generation of first-principles 3-D models for
   piping intensive systems based on design information that is available
   at an early design stage, namely piping \& instrumentation diagrams
   (P\&ID). An algorithm is presented for the generation of such 3-D models
   based on machine-readable P\&ID information. The main focus of the
   algorithm is the automatic generation of feasible pipelines into the 3-D
   models, so that the model has sufficient information, which can be
   exploited in further work to automatically generate high fidelity
   first-principles thermo-hydraulic simulations.},

Abstract = {One of the main themes of this work is to incorporate the geometric
   aspects that characterize a certain type of architecture within a
   broader rule system, which, in the whole, generate the forms. Therefore,
   the solution would be to draw the reconstruction of a parametric model,
   through the application to a selected case study: Palazzo del Lavoro of
   Pier Luigi Nervi. The identification of some weaknesses of the project
   is important in order to digitally intervene on them, to prefigure a new
   life of the artifact in a virtual environment. By doing so, it will be
   possible to have truthful feedback in the real environment. The survey
   phase did not intend to reason on the architecture in its complexity,
   but rather on the observation of the matrices that regulate the similar
   geometries between them. The translation of these matrices into
   mathematical models, following the logic of HBIM and Algorithmic Design
   (AD), has allowed the creation of two different models. The first one,
   an informed model, characterized by a more traditional workflow,
   consists of building components based on design drawings of the time,
   aimed at graphically and quantitatively describe the entire artifact.
   The second one, a partial model of the only vertical component of the
   facade, is based on the canons of the element, and it is structured
   through algorithms that describe only a part of the architecture. The
   research wanted to deepen the interoperability of the information coming
   from the parametric models BIM with those generated by the algorithms.},

Abstract = {In the field of infrastructure construction, progress in digital
   transformation remains limited; this is particularly true in road
   construction, an infrastructure facility involving design, construction,
   and operation stages. Many construction subjects are involved at each
   stage of this cycle, generating substantial construction information. To
   drive the digital transformation of the construction industry, a
   construction information classification system is necessary for the
   development of a systematic construction information model. This study
   focuses on categorizing construction information into objects and
   activities, defining unit work by combining these two categories, and
   allowing for the flexible processing of construction information. A
   construction information classification system was developed,
   representing the evolving construction-related methodological
   information throughout the project's lifecycle. Applying this
   multi-story expandable systematic hierarchical system to a highway
   project demonstrates the representation of key tasks in each
   construction phase, enabling the future stage-specific expansion of
   construction information for individual tasks. The proposed system could
   advance the digital transformation in infrastructure construction.},

Abstract = {Computational models have long been used to support decision making in
   water management. With growth in the availability of data and plummeting
   cost of computation, the way these models are deployed is changing.
   Single simulations for ``best estimate{''} conditions are giving way to
   the use of multi-run computational experiments as exemplified by risk,
   uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. In this paper we look beyond these
   techniques to a new generation of tools. Building on simulation and risk
   analysis, these tools will enable systematic, quantitative decision
   analysis, allowing the merits of sets of options to be examined and
   compared, according to a variety of metrics and under a range of
   possible future conditions.
   We outline a conceptual framework for decision analysis for strategic
   planning. The life cycle of flood defence assets lasts 100 to 150 years,
   and option appraisal must encompass this cycle. The many processes that
   will influence the state of the system on this time scale must be
   explicitly represented, allowing for the considerable uncertainties
   involved.
   The approach described is novel in a number of respects, among which the
   following stand out.
   Processes of long term change, including the implementation of
   management interventions, are simulated. System states at future times
   are calculated conditional upon a simulated future, not manually
   assembled.
   The costing of interventions and options (timed sets of interventions)
   is integrated into the framework. Costs can be a function of system
   state at the time of implementation of the intervention, and can
   therefore be influenced by long term change processes and uncertainty.
   The assessment of option benefits and costs is integrated and the
   results combined into measures of option performance. This makes it
   possible to ensure that performance estimates are based on internally
   consistent scenarios and account for dependence between variables
   influencing costs and benefits.
   Computational experiments such as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
   are applied to the overall performance analysis rather than its
   component parts, leading to information of greater value to decision
   makers.
   We describe an implementation of this framework in the context of a
   simple flood risk management situation. The performance metric used is
   Net Present Value of reduction in Expected Annual Damage. Processes of
   long term change include increasing relative mean sea level and
   increasing damage potential resulting from economic growth. In both
   cases the rates of increase are uncertain, as are the costs of
   implementing the interventions from which options are constructed. These
   various uncertainties are expressed as probability density functions
   (PDFs) over the variables in question. They are propagated through to
   option performance by means of a Monte Carlo experiment, allowing a PDF
   on performance to be constructed for each option (figure 1). A range of
   additional diagnostic outputs can also be generated.},

Abstract = {Information management (IM) is a critical component to projects in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction industry. A defined IM
   process can improve a project's lifecycle, from project delivery to
   operations and maintenance. Typically, owners are the project
   stakeholders that can benefit the most from having a defined IM process
   as having current, relevant, and accurate information can improve
   decision-making and overall project performance. To this end, a
   longitudinal study of university construction contract documents with
   respect to IM was carried out. The focus was on universities as they are
   owners and operators who have a vested interest in their project's
   lifecycle. Researchers evaluated contract documents comprised of the
   construction manager at risk (CMAR) agreement and the general conditions
   document for one university system and these documents span 2002-2019.
   Three versions of the CMAR agreement and three versions of the general
   conditions documents were analyzed and compared using qualitative
   analysis and coding. The main areas of analysis were information
   transactions, IM systems, and legal factors impacting IM. Results of
   this analysis show that as new IM processes, such as building
   information modeling, were adopted in the organization, more specific
   language regarding the process of IM were included in the contract
   documents. These findings illustrate how IM has evolved over time in
   university contracts between owners and contractors.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The initial core product model (CPM), developed at NIST for the support
   of in-house research projects, has been extended to create CPM2,
   intended to support a broad range of information relevant to product
   lifecycle management. CPM2 is a generic, abstract model with generic
   semantics. CPM2 gives equal status to three aspects of a product or
   artifact: its function, its form, and its behavior Thus, CPM2 can
   support functional reasoning about a product in the conceptual stages of
   design, the recording and the modeling of its behavior in the postdesign
   stages as well as the ``traditional{''} design phases. Three levels of
   CPM2 models, denoted as the conceptual, intermediate, and implementation
   models, are described. Extensions of the initial CPM are briefly
   presented. The facilities in CPM2 for building experimental intermediate
   systems are demonstrated and a short illustrative example is given. The
   full practical evaluation of CPM2 will require the development and use
   of implementation models.},

Title = {<i>IFCdiff</i>: A content-based automatic comparison approach for IFC
   files},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {53-68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the growth in popularity of the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)
   format used in construction industry, it often requires effective
   methods of IFC comparison to keep track of important changes during the
   lifecycle of construction projects. However, most IFC comparisons are
   based on a visual inspection, a manual count and a check of selective
   attributes. Although a few techniques about automatic IFC comparisons
   have been developed recently, they are usually time-consuming, and are
   sensitive to the GUID change or redundant instances in IFC files. To
   address these issues, we propose a content-based automatic comparison
   approach, named IFCdiff, for detecting differences between two IFC
   files. The proposed approach starts with a comprehensive analysis of the
   structure and content of each IFC file, and then constructs its
   hierarchical structure along with eliminating redundant instances. Next,
   the two hierarchical structures are compared with each other for
   detecting changes in an iterative bottom-up procedure. Our approach
   fully considers the content of IFC files without the need of flattening
   instances in IFC files. In contrast with previous methods, our approach
   can greatly reduce the computational time and space, and the comparison
   result is not sensitive to redundant instances in IFC files. Finally, we
   demonstrate a potential application to incremental backup of IFC files.

Title = {Holistic approach to achieving low-energy, high-rise residential
   buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {522-541},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As codes and standards evolve toward low-or net zero-energy buildings,
   the practicality of achieving these targets in high-rise concrete
   construction gets increasingly challenging. High-rise residential
   buildings are becoming more common as cities redevelop and add density.
   Current design and construction practice for high-rise multi-unit
   residential buildings present a number of constraints with regard to
   achieving high levels of energy performance. These practice issues
   typically include ( a) the desire to maximize glass to enhance
   marketability, daylight, and views; ( b) the desire to provide access to
   the outdoors via extended balconies; ( c) the need for Code-mandated
   non-combustibility and life safety requirements; ( d) a preference for
   building systems that minimize exterior construction access and
   streamlines construction sequencing; ( e) the adoption of increased
   structural load requirements; and/ or ( f) the drive to minimize initial
   capital costs. The outcome of these combined constraints is often poor
   energy efficiency, with the burden of higher operating costs deferred to
   future owners. There has been significant industry discussion on the
   poor energy performance of this class of building, but there is very
   little guidance or long-term factual strategic information beyond broad
   principles of minimizing glazing areas, maximizing glazing performance,
   increasing airtightness, and adding more insulation to opaque areas.
   This article explores the prospect of energy use becoming a primary
   consideration in high-rise residential buildings and what that will
   likely mean for the typical competing constraints mentioned earlier.
   This article utilizes the current common construction practices for
   concrete-framed, high-rise residential buildings in heating dominated
   climates ( ASHRAE Zones 4 to 7) as a baseline to evaluate the impact of
   the interconnected variables related to reducing overall heating energy
   use. The objective is to weigh the impact of individual improvements
   against integrated bundles of measures to develop a roadmap and a better
   understanding of a practical path toward low-energy, high-rise
   residential buildings. The article focuses on solutions related to
   building envelope performance but from a holistic perspective that
   recognizes the interaction and contribution of mechanical systems
   typical of this construction type. The building envelope parameters
   covered includes glazing performance ( for both conventional and
   innovative technologies) and opaque wall performance ( with a focus on
   specific details to reduce thermal bridging rather than increasing
   insulation levels). The analysis presented draws upon three-dimensional
   thermal modeling, whole building energy analysis, field testing and
   monitoring, and typical construction costs. The goal is to develop
   realistic targets for high-rise buildings and identify improvements that
   can be arrived at by market forces rather than those that can only be
   realized through more stringent and enforceable codes and standards.},

   design, construction and performance in the post-digital era},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION GEOTECHNICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Industry 4.0 revolution signifies a pivotal transition in pavement
   technology, emphasising the integration of digital and physical systems
   to revamp traditional, empirical -based pavement design, construction,
   and maintenance practices. This shift promises enhanced efficiency,
   sustainability, and a move towards integrated practices, highlighted by
   adopting `` Digital Twin `` technology. Unlike traditional Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), Digital Twin technology offers a real-time,
   dynamic representation of physical infrastructure, enabling improved
   asset management through distributed sensing and predictive performance
   analytics. Leveraging findings from the Australian Research Council
   (ARC) ` s Industry Transformation Research Hub for Smart Next Generation
   Transport Pavements (SPARC Hub), this paper focuses on the integration
   of pavement testing, design, construction, condition assessment and
   asset management into the lifecycle of unbound road pavements. The paper
   outlines how such technological integration streamlines decision -making
   processes and significantly boosts the functionality and longevity of
   pavement infrastructures. Despite facing challenges like cost, data
   security, and the need for specialised skills, the potential for digital
   technologies to improve pavement durability, efficiency, and
   sustainability is significant. Future research directions are identified
   to overcome implementation barriers, explore untapped technological
   potentials, and assess the sustainability benefits of digital approaches
   in pavement engineering, aiming to forge more resilient, efficient, and
   sustainable road networks for future generations.},

Abstract = {Software testing groups are playing an increasingly prominent role in
   both the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and in the long-term

   architectures (EA) provides new opportunities for testing groups to play
   a proactive role in building consistent and testable guidelines for
   improving enterprise-wide software quality. Given that testing groups
   historically have not been invited to participate in EA decisions, there
   is little academic literature or industry best practices on approaches
   that testers might use to guide their participation. This article draws
   lessons from the experience of a Fortune 100 corporation whose testing
   group used theoretical notions of ``testability{''} to guide its
   involvement in an EA acquisition process. It describes how it
   operationalized testability criteria, incorporating controllability,
   observability, and simplicity, into various stages of the process and
   illustrates the benefits and challenges of taking such an approach.},

Title = {Financial Digital Twin for Public Sector Capital Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {As facility owners and operators, public sector organizations (such as
   government agencies) that provide public facilities and services not
   only maintain the existing capital assets but also plan for future
   developments on an ongoing basis through a capital improvement program
   (CIP). The CIP identifies capital projects and is typically funded
   through several distinct funding sources with specific usage, timing,
   and reporting restrictions. The continuous nature of capital improvement
   planning compounded by the potential for scope or funding availability
   changes further makes it a challenge to retain the flexibility to add
   new and different funding sources to an existing funding allocation
   plan. Existing literature about this problem is sparse, and a systemic
   solution is yet to be proposed that enables an owner organization to
   meet its goals while maintaining fiscal responsibility toward its
   funding agencies. The financial digital twin (FinDT) framework developed
   in this study integrates fund allocation and accounting with project
   acquisition in real time and enables the owner to automate funding
   allocation tasks and to synchronize change management while ensuring
   compliance with funding restrictions. The goal of this framework is to
   leverage rule-based knowledge management to consolidate and continually
   optimize the efficient use of accurate financial information at all
   stages of the capital asset lifecycle. This is accomplished through
   automation and digital twin (DT) integration. A use case was developed
   to demonstrate and evaluate the FinDT, which was found to hold potential
   for more efficient information management and support for decision
   making through enterprise-level data integration. The framework
   developed in this study can be used to display other nongeometric
   attribute information in a building information model for the purposes
   of visualization and interactive, efficient decision making.},

Title = {Evaluation of a multi-species test system for assessing acute and
   chronic toxicity of sediments and water to aquatic invertebrates -:
   Effects of pentachlorophenol on <i>Daphnia magna</i> and <i>Chironomus
   prasinus</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-58},
Abstract = {Background, Aims and Scope. Single-species toxicity tests are currently
   used as main tools for assessing effects in ecological risk assessments.
   Nevertheless, in higher-tier evaluations, alternative ecotoxicological
   methods can be required. Alternative methods should cover more realistic
   exposure conditions and/or additional species or endpoints.
   Water/sediment systems can be considered for covering additional
   exposure routes. A typical feature of water/sediment systems is the
   modification of exposure levels with time. The simultaneous exposure of
   different species within the same system can cover differences in
   sensitivity and relevance of exposure routes. The aim of this study was
   to develop a water/sediment test that could detect relevant effects on
   two selected species and explore the relevance of sediment and
   waterborne exposure routes. This alternative method may provide relevant
   information facilitating the design of microcosm and mesocosm studies.
   Methods. A multi-species water/sediment system was designed using two
   invertebrates: Chironomus prasinus a benthic detritivote invertebrate
   and Dapbnia magna a pelagic filtering invertebrate. Seven static
   water/sediment systems were built up: two controls and five treatments
   where sediments were spiked with NaPCP at nominal concentrations of
   1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Each system contained caged
   and free (unrestrained) Daphnia magna organisms to consider differences
   in the exposure route (through sediment and/or water column) and
   Chironomus prasinus organisms. Fate and partitioning of PCP within the
   water/sediment compartments were assessed. Acute (lethality) and chronic
   effects (reproduction) for Dapbnia magna were monitored after 48 h and
   16 days of exposure, respectively. Adult emergence and oviposition
   success of Chironomus prasinus were monitored at the end of test (16
   days).
   Results and Discussion. Mortality and reproduction inhibition of Daphnia
   magna occurred at the two higher doses, corresponding to maximum
   measured PCP water concentrations of 1.95 and 0.746 mg/l, respectively.
   Chironomus prasinus was less sensitive to PCP than Daphnia magna.
   Concentrations inhibiting reproduction and provoking almost 100\% adult
   mortality in D. magna only reduced slightly the emergence and
   reproduction of chironomids. The experimental design focussed on
   suitability of the system for simultaneously assessing effects on D.
   magna and C. prasinus instead of calculations of toxicity endpoints for
   PCR The results indicate that this experimental design can be useful to
   the field of sediment/aquatic toxicity testing, particularly through the
   comparison with single-species results. Assessment of relative
   contribution of two exposure routes for Daphnia magna and complementary
   chronic endpoints derived from two different species can be achieved.
   Another advantage is that differences in reproduction strategies of
   selected species (sexual vs. parthenogenetic) should permit one to
   detect mechanisms of action associated with endocrine disrupters.
   Conclusion. The feasibility of a two-species test built-up in an
   artificial sediment/water system has been demonstrated. This
   experimental design represents a cost/effective test which can assess
   effects through water and sediment pathways and incorporates several
   relevant chronic endpoints in a single assay.
   Recommendation and Outlook. By building on the experience gained,
   improvements for further test designs are discussed. Test validation
   with a set of model chemicals will contribute to address the
   effectiveness of the test developed as compared to single-species tests.},

Title = {Digital Twin Hospital Buildings: An Exemplary Case Study through
   Continuous Lifecycle Integration},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings usually contain sophisticated facility systems and
   special medical equipment, strict security requirements, and business
   systems. Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of
   real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing
   innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle
   integration{''} method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and
   ``early movement{''} of the general contractor, this paper reported a
   successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized
   continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of
   more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O\&M
   phase up to the O\&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time
   visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was
   developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have
   the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual
   management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation
   suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building
   to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in
   the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy
   consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested
   repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

Abstract = {With billions of pounds in lost time and mistakes, the digitisation of
   information in the construction industry provides the biggest
   opportunity for improving the built environment assets that people use
   every day. There is a continued push to improve management and delivery
   of the best possible products for the users. With growing recognition
   that more intelligent methods for planning and designing assets is
   required. Whilst the construction sector made significant gains through
   the current information digitisation efforts, there is still vast
   amounts of information that needs to be digitised to ensure usability
   and add more value to the lifecycle of an asset. This paper provides the
   initial framework to analyse the impact of requirements validation of an
   infrastructure asset with real world data, using ifc, asset register and
   GIS files to demonstrate compliance. It uses systems engineering
   principles for the application of requirements decomposition, breakdown,
   and modelling of various MBSE models to show how a function and
   capability can be validated using semantic web techniques to exchange
   data. The framework is demonstrated through a high-level case study for
   the compliance of a fire safety system of a railway station, based on
   system and construction data models. Further validation has been
   accomplished through subject matter expert feedback.},

Abstract = {Working memory plays a crucial role in our daily lives, and brain
   imaging has been used to predict working memory performance. Here, we
   present an improved connectome-based predictive modeling approach for
   building a predictive model of individual working memory performance
   from whole-brain functional connectivity. The model was built using
   n-back task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI data from the Human
   Connectome Project. Compared to prior models, our model was more
   interpretable, demonstrated a closer connection to the known anatomical
   and functional network. The model also demonstrates strong
   generalization on nine other cognitive behaviors from the HCP database
   and can well predict the working memory performance of healthy
   individuals in external datasets. By comparing the differences in
   prediction effects of different brain networks and anatomical feature
   analysis on n-back tasks, we found the essential role of some networks
   in differentiating between high and low working memory loads conditions.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how the needs to exchange information across
   organizational boundaries in the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction, and Facilities Management industry in Finland have been
   satisfied by means of stakeholder integration at the technical, business
   and socio-organizational levels. We interviewed practitioners about
   their motivations and goals for interorganizational integration and
   observed different discourses. The information exchange needs in the
   context of individual building projects were often described as
   ``addressed{''}. These needs focused mainly on managing complex
   stakeholder relations or handling the variable conditions with other
   building projects. In the scope of the whole built environment
   lifecycle, the needs were rather portrayed as ongoing problems still
   ``unaddressed{''}. Existing information sources remained inadequate when
   the benefits of inter-organizational integration had not yet been
   clarified. The process workflow discontinuities demanded better
   understanding of the value of information beyond design as well as
   better coordination. The uncertainty of how much data to collect and for
   what purposes can be mitigated by defining ``useful minimum{''}
   information exchange between stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to improve the usability and adaptation
   of complex information system (CIS) by reducing the complexity. The
   paper introduces CIS, the complexity of CIS, usability and adaptation
   issues of CIS, and potential solutions for these issues. Research
   suggests User Interface (UI) customization can address usability and
   adaptation issues in CIS. This research proposes the Object-Oriented
   User Interface Customization (OOUIC) framework to reduce the complexity
   of CIS, in order to improve the usability and adaptation. The OOUIC
   approach suggests that classifying users by user roles, e.g., job roles,
   can reduce the complexity. Use Case Analysis (UCA) can identify actors
   (job roles) and use cases (goals, tasks, and functions) to develop use
   case diagrams, tasks diagrams, and function models. Based on
   model-driven modeling, the mapping between use case diagrams, task
   diagrams, and function models enables automatic selection of abstract UI
   and development of concrete UI for each job role. Building connections
   between vendor UI (V-UI) and concrete UI to generate the adaptable
   vendor-free UI (MyUI) can ensure the reuse of UI customization on
   whichever V-UI. The efficiency, robustness, and maintainability of the
   method had been justified in previous studies. This research proposes a
   two-phase study by using the product lifecycle management (PLM) system
   as an example to illustrate that the framework can reduce complexity and
   improve usability and adaptation.},

Abstract = {Despite the great potential of LPS and BIM to improve construction
   project productivity, the full integration of these modern production
   and information management systems at the data processing level is not
   yet achieved. After matching the literature to empirical studies in a
   Constructive Research Approach, it emerged that very few studies have
   investigated how buildings' data could be preserved and continuously
   evolve during the project lifecycle. Accordingly, we underline the
   potential role of data warehousing in rendering operational data as a
   strategic asset for decision making. These findings motivate the present
   research, which aims to capitalize on quantity surveying data in order
   to automate the generation of M \& E installation schedules. This paper
   first introduces the system functional requirements. Then, it proposes a
   conceptual scheme for the planning data mart (a data warehouse subset
   dedicated to planning subject area). Furthermore, we shed light on the M
   \& E fragnet standardization procedure and how data have been processed.
   Finally, we present the current software developments to demonstrate the
   feasibility of this concept.},

Abstract = {This paper shows two applications of a theory of part-whole relations
   that has been introduced in {[}1] in two different areas: natural
   language semantics and modelling parts of physical objects. A short
   overview of the theory will be given, followed by two sections which
   present results in the two application areas. In Section 2 we provide an
   analysis of the domain of solid objects like devices, buildings and
   other artifacts of our daily life. We first examine in more detail the
   relevant part-whole relations in that domain. The second part describes
   how these relations can be represented and manipulated in a hybrid
   system. In Section 3 it will be shown that there is a strong and
   immediate correspondence between classes of part-whole-relations and
   syntactically or lexically motivated classes of genitive constructions.
   The two applications illustrate the generality of the theory as well as
   its usefulness for representing and reasoning about part-whole
   information in totally different domains.},

Title = {A Semantic Product Modeling Framework and Its Application to Behavior

Abstract = {Supporting different stakeholder viewpoints across the product lifecycle
   requires semantic richness to represent product-related information and
   enable multiview engineering simulations. This paper proposes a
   multilevel product modeling framework enabling stakeholders to define
   product models and relate them to physical or simulated instances. The
   framework is defined within the Model-Driven Architecture using the
   multilevel (data, model, metamodel) approach. The data level represents
   real-world products, the model level describes models (product models)
   of real-world products, and the metamodel level describes models of the
   product models. The metamodel defined in this paper is specialized from
   a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the
   semantics of product models in an engineering-friendly way. The
   interactions between these three levels are described to show how each
   level in the framework is used in a product engineering context. A
   product design scenario and user interface for the product metamodel is
   provided for further understanding of the framework.
   Note to Practitioners-The views of stakeholders in a product lifecycle
   may be different according to their concerns. However, they develop
   product models and data for a same product. The product models and data
   should be managed in a single framework to validate consistency of
   product information. The framework proposed in this paper enables
   stakeholders to define their product models and relate them to physical
   or simulated instances. A generic metamodel is also proposed to guide
   engineers in building their product models using engineer-friendly
   terms. A product design scenario and user interface prototype was
   implemented for further understanding of the framework and the
   metamodel. If the prototype is integrated with a Computer-Aided Design
   (CAD) system, it can be a powerful mechanism for semantically annotating
   CAD models.},

Abstract = {Recent introduction of data mining methods has led to a paradigm shift
   in the way we can analyze space data. This paper demonstrates that
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially the field of Knowledge
   Representation and Reasoning (KRR), could also be successfully employed
   at the start of the space mission life cycle via an Expert System (ES)
   used as a Design Engineering Assistant (DEA). An ES is an AI-based agent
   used to solve complex problems in particular fields. There are many
   examples of ES being successfully implemented in the aeronautical,
   agricultural, legal or medical fields. Applied to space mission design,
   and in particular, in the context of concurrent engineering sessions, an
   ES could serve as a knowledge engine and support the generation of the
   initial design inputs, provide easy and quick access to previous design
   decisions or push to explore new design options. Integrated to the User
   design environment, the DEA could become an active assistant following
   the design iterations and flagging model inconsistencies.
   Today, for space missions design, experts apply methods of concurrent
   engineering and Model-Based System Engineering, relying both on their
   implicit knowledge (i.e., past experiences, network) and on available
   explicit knowledge (i.e., past reports, publications, data sheets). The
   former knowledge type represents still the most significant amount of
   data, mostly unstructured, non-digital or digital data of various legacy
   formats. Searching for information through this data is highly
   time-consuming. A solution is to convert this data into structured data
   to be stored into a Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be traversed by an
   inference engine to provide reasoning and deductions on its nodes.
   Knowledge is extracted from the KG via a User Interface (UI) and a query
   engine providing reliable and relevant knowledge summaries to the Human
   experts. The DEA project aims to enhance the productivity of experts by
   providing them with new insights into a large amount of data accumulated
   in the field of space mission design. Natural Language Processing (NLP),
   Machine Learning (ML), Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Machine
   Interaction (HMI) methods are leveraged to develop the DEA. Building the
   knowledge base manually is subjective, time-consuming, laborious and
   error bound. This is why the knowledge base generation and population
   rely on Ontology Learning (OL) methods. This OL approach follows a
   modified model of the Ontology Layer Cake. This paper describes the
   approach and the parameters used for the qualitative trade-off for the
   selection of the software to be adopted in the architecture of the ES.
   The study also displays the first results of the multi-word extraction
   and highlights the importance of Word Sense Disambiguation for the
   identification of synonyms in the context. This paper includes the
   detailed software architecture of both front and back-ends, as well as
   the tool requirements. Both architectures and requirements were refined
   after a set of interviews with experts from the European Space Agency.
   The paper finally presents the preliminary strategy to quantify and
   mitigate uncertainties within the ES.},

Title = {BIM-Based Parametric Design Methodology for Modernized Korean

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {With rising social interest in the quality of life and sustainable
   development in architecture, demands are growing for Hanok, traditional
   buildings of Korea, as a viable alternative to modernized architecture
   of Western origin. However, even as the so-called ``New Hanok{''} -
   which updates the traditional structure with modern design - is gaining
   popularity among the general public, its design and construction are
   still a minor practice, in the sense that they rely on a small group of
   professional carpenters whose practice largely rests on their personal
   experience. Aiming to build an information system of Hanok that can
   contribute to the industrialization of its production, this research
   proposes a new design process for traditional architecture, utilizing a
   parametric design methodology. This process, based on the understanding
   of tectonic joints and spatial composition of our traditional
   architecture, defines a parametric relationship among the structural
   elements that compose Hanok. The research uses Gehry Technologies'
   Digital Project and Autodesk Revit Architecture - most useful commercial
   programs of parametric (and associate) design among today's CAD/CAE/CAM
   applications - to apply a concurrent parametric design methodology,
   approaching the project from both ``bottom-up{''} (building initiated by
   the assembly of smallest elements) and ``top-down{''} (building from
   partial modifications on a pre-determined whole), to present a new
   design process for Hanok elements.},

   of Urban Digital Twins},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Solar radiation impacts diverse aspects of city life, such as harvesting
   energy with PV panels, passive heating of buildings in winter, cooling
   the loads of air-conditioning systems in summer, and the urban
   microclimate. Urban digital twins and 3D city models can support solar
   studies in the process of urban planning and provide valuable insights
   for data-driven decision support. This study examines the calculation of
   solar incident radiation at the city scale in Sofia using remote sensing
   data for the large shading context in a mountainous region and 3D
   building data. It aims to explore the methods of geometry optimisation,
   limitations, and performance issues of a 3D computer-aided design (CAD)
   tool dedicated to small-scale solar analysis and employed at the city
   scale. Two cases were considered at the city and district scales,
   respectively. The total face count of meshes for the simulations
   constituted approximately 2,000,000 faces. A total of 64,379 roofs for
   the whole city and 4796 buildings for one district were selected. All
   calculations were performed in one batch and visualised in a 3D web
   platform. The use of a 3D CAD environment establishes a seamless process
   of updating 3D models and simulations, while preprocessing in Geographic
   Information System (GIS) ensures working with large-scale datasets. The
   proposed method showed a moderate computation time for both cases and
   could be extended to include reflected radiation and dense
   photogrammetric meshes in the future.},

Title = {Analysis of Guidelines and Identification of Characteristics Influencing
   the Deconstruction Potential of Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Growing concerns regarding environmental preservation and the fact that
   the construction industry is one of the sectors with the highest rates
   of resource consumption and waste generation, have encouraged the
   adoption of deconstruction as an alternative to the demolition of
   buildings at the end of their lifecycle. However, the choice of
   strategies to enable deconstruction requires an in-depth knowledge of
   how the building's characteristics, combined with the procedures adopted
   in the deconstruction process, will affect the reutilization of
   materials and components. In this paper, characteristics relating to
   design for deconstruction (DfD) are identified and the influence of each
   characteristic on the viability of a deconstruction is analysed. A
   literature review is conducted to assess the guideline of DfD and to
   identify relevant characteristics. These characteristics are then
   divided into the following categories: direct influence enabling
   deconstruction; influence on the ease of the process; and, influence on
   prolonging a building's lifecycle. A number of questions are suggested
   for analysing each characteristic, and these can be employed in the
   development of a methodology for evaluating a building's deconstruction
   potential. The identification of characteristics involved in the
   deconstruction guidelines may assist in the optimization of projects and
   the planning of deconstruction processes.},

Abstract = {The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a unique, specialized chemical
   synapse that plays a crucial role in transmitting and amplifying
   information from spinal motor neurons to skeletal muscles. NMJ
   complexity ensures closely intertwined interactions between numerous
   synaptic vesicles, signaling molecules, ion channels, motor neurons,
   glia, and muscle fibers, making it difficult to dissect the underlying
   mechanisms and factors affecting neurodegeneration and muscle loss.
   Muscle fiber or motor neuron cell death followed by rapid axonal
   degeneration due to injury or disease has a debilitating effect on
   movement and behavior, which adversely affects the quality of life. It
   thus becomes imperative to study the synapse and intercellular signaling
   processes that regulate plasticity at the NMJ and elucidate mechanisms
   and pathways at the cellular level. Studies using in vitro 2D cell
   cultures have allowed us to gain a fundamental understanding of how the
   NMJ functions. However, they do not provide information on the intricate
   signaling networks that exist between NMJs and the biological
   environment. The advent of 3D cell cultures and microfluidic
   lab-on-a-chip technologies has opened whole new avenues to explore the
   NMJ. In this perspective, we look at the challenges involved in building
   a functional NMJ and the progress made in generating models for studying
   the NMJ, highlighting the current and future applications of these
   models.},

   for wood based houses is unavailable. This is a barrier to responsible
   cost estimation in the pre construction phases of projects, as well as
   to proper lifecycle-cost analysis and optimisation. The present study
   had two objectives. The first was to answer the fundamental question of
   whether the investment costs of wood-based houses are lower than those
   of brick-based houses, with an emphasis on the construction systems
   commonly used in the Czech Republic. Ordinary least squares and
   generalised linear model regression analyses indicated that wood-based
   houses are 4.3\% more expensive than brick-based houses. The second
   objective of this study was to identify and verify other factors that
   influence the investment costs of houses in the Czech Republic. The
   research was conducted using databases containing 1520 catalogue houses
   with defined specifications and investment costs based on market data.
   Furthermore, single-floor houses were found to be more expensive than
   double-floor houses regardless of the material base. The design of
   easy-shaped houses is preferred to reduce the investment cost. The `m'
   index was not suitable for reflecting the house shape in the investment
   cost.},

Abstract = {With the advent of the fourth Industrial Revolution, sensors, machines,
   tools, and intelligent systems became connected and can interact with
   each other along the production chain. Such changes tend to increase
   productivity, as well as to promote changes in the workforce profile,
   and intensify competitiveness. The construction industry, however, has
   not kept up with other sectors in terms of adding technologies to its
   processes. Among other reasons, the lack of understanding about how
   technologies can be helpful to the industry is one of the main factors
   hindering the adoption. The aim of this work is, therefore, to analyze
   how the changes driven by the so-called Industry 4.0 can impact the
   construction industry. A Systematic Literature Review was conducted to
   identify the technology trends discussed and analyzed by the academy in
   the last years. We grouped the technologies according to their
   similarity and analyzed which phase of the construction lifecycle they
   could mainly impact. The results provide an essential overview of the
   vectors that may transform the industry in the coming years. It is
   possible to see that technologies such as BIM, along with other virtual
   environment concepts, and 3D Printing are subjects with great
   expressiveness among the selected papers. Also, the planning and
   management phase tends to be most revolutionized by introducing new
   technologies, followed by the construction stage. This work can
   contribute to developing an innovative vision and culture within the
   construction industry.},

Abstract = {With the continually expanding of city construction scale in china,
   metropolitan area network transmission system is established at present.
   But with the increase of network users, the network capacity can not

   to expand the capacity of the network developed. According to its size,
   building the appropriate model for the metropolitan area network is the

Title = {Critical success factors for implementing 3D printing technology in
   construction projects: academics and construction practitioners'
   perspectives},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 11},
Abstract = {PurposeThe application of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in
   construction projects is of increasing interest to researchers and
   construction practitioners. Although the application of 3D printing
   technology at various stages of the project lifecycle has been explored,
   few studies have identified the relative importance of critical success
   factors (CSFs) for implementing 3D printing technology in construction
   projects. To address this research gap, this study aims to explore the
   academics (i.e. researchers) and construction practitioners'
   perspectives on CSFs for implementing 3D printing technology in
   construction projects. Design/methodology/approachTo do this, a
   questionnaire was administered to participants (i.e. academics and
   construction practitioners) with knowledge and expertise in 3D printing
   technology in construction projects. The collected data were analysed
   using mean score ranking, normalization and rank agreement analysis to
   identify CSFs and determine the consistency of the ranking of CSFs
   between academics and construction practitioners. In addition,
   exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the relationships and
   underlying constructs of the measured CSFs. FindingsThrough a rank
   agreement analysis of the collected data, 11 CSFs for implementing 3D
   printing technology were retrieved (i.e. 17\% agreement), indicating a
   diverse agreement in the ranking of the CSFs between academics and
   construction practitioners. In addition, the results show three key
   components of CSFs including ``production demand enabling CSFs{''},
   ``optimize the construction process enabling CSFs{''} and ``optimized
   design enabling CSFs{''}. Originality/valueThis study highlights the
   feasibility of implementing the identified CSFs for 3D printing
   technology in construction projects, which not only serves as a
   reference for other researchers but also increases construction
   practitioners' awareness of the practical benefits of implementing 3D
   printing technology in construction projects. Specifically, it would
   optimize the construction lifecycle processes, enhance digital
   transformation and promote sustainable construction projects.},

   system analyses and detects architectural issues by leveraging
   information obtain from Software Development Kits (SDKs). For the
   evaluation of our proposal, we have focused on mobile codebases (private

   heterogeneous systems and technologies such as manufacturing execution
   system (MES), product lifecycle management (PLM), process mining (PM),
   discrete event simulation (DES), and virtual reality (VR) and its
   application case. The architecture and practice will help practical CPS

   critical discussions by applying the principles to existing works and

Abstract = {New product development (NPD) represents a significant portion of the
   product lifecycle. Recent years have seen the adoption of
   cross-functional stage-gate NPD process models by manufacturers. These
   models demand the effective sharing of knowledge among individuals with
   different functional backgrounds and levels of experience. This scenario
   presents various knowledge sharing challenges. These challenges have
   been further complicated by the emergence of global product development,
   in which project teams may be comprised of individuals with no common
   language. This paper presents a methodology for building a mechanism
   that allows information about knowledge in the NPD process to be made
   available in a multilingual environment. The mechanism is a component of
   an ontology based NPD knowledge sharing developed by the authors.
   Implementation of the methodology using data from an industrial case
   study have demonstrated that it can applied successfully in practice,
   but further development and user feedback from industry is required.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an innovative model-driven architecture enabling 3D
   web-based design processes in the field of large complex building (LBC)
   projects, such as power plant construction. This work was motivated by
   proposing new ways of achieving 3D CAD tasks not only for highly complex
   and temporary organization in the design stages but also for the whole
   lifecycle of such installations, which may last several decades. in this
   particular scenario, it is very important to share the right information
   with the right stakeholder at the right time, to maintain a high level
   of knowledge sharing. Taking into account these challenges, we propose a
   first implementation of interactive 3D CAD editing tools, based on the
   X3DOM technology and driven by a knowledge layer which utilizes a
   complete reference data and rules management system. To store the CAD
   models, a Macro-Parametric Approach has been investigated and a 3D
   server has been added to the traditional PDM (Product or Plant Data
   Management) to execute remotely complex CAD operations. This is a very
   promising start to deploy lightweight and smart web3D CAD editing
   services for the AEC (Architecture Engineering Construction) and power
   industries.},

Abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) of electrical demand for the
   purpose of identifying load components has thus far mostly been studied
   using univariate data, e.g., using only whole building electricity
   consumption time series to identify a certain type of end-use such as
   lighting load. However, using additional variables in the form of
   multivariate time series data may provide more information in ``terms of
   extracting distinguishable features in the context of energy
   disaggregation. In this work, a novel probabilistic graphical modeling
   approach, namely the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) is proposed
   for energy disaggregation using multivariate time-series data. The STPN
   framework is shown to be capable of handling diverse types of
   multivariate time-series to improve the energy disaggregation
   performance. The technique outperforms the state of the art factorial
   hidden Markov models (FHMM) and combinatorial optimization (CO)
   techniques in multiple real-life test cases. Furthermore, based on two
   homes' aggregate electric consumption data, a similarity metric is
   defined for the energy disaggregation of one home using a trained model
   based on the other home (i.e., out-of-sample case). The proposed
   similarity metric allows us to enhance scalability via learning
   supervised models for a few homes and deploying such models to many
   other similar but unmodeled homes with significantly high disaggregation
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {As the amount of information available on the Internet is growing very

   creation of customized tools for knowledge management is becoming
   increasingly important. The paper proposes an approach to construction
   of personalized information services that can be customized to the needs
   of different users. The approach is based on two models: model of user's
   information needs and information environment model (types of data
   sources). An implementation of the approach is considered on the example
   of system which is intended for concrete category of users: researchers
   in the area of the Semantic Web. Three basic types of users queries have
   been identified: news, general and analytical. Designing the
   personalized service is considered from the standpoint of the main
   stages of the queries lifecycle: its construction and execution. Two
   types of ontologies are used for initial query constructing: basic
   ontology of research activity and the domain ontology. Query execution
   algorithms include obtaining data from different types of sources (HTML,
   HTML+RDFa, RSS, SPARQL endpoints) and its processing depending on the
   features of the query. In addition the design pattern for effective
   building of queries management module is proposed. In conclusion future
   directions of prototype improvement are discussed.},

Abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) has become a hot topic in
   structural engineering. It has an immense potential in promoting the
   intelligence of construction, changing the traditional way of detection,
   optimizing the usage of building. Especially during the last ten years,
   the number of publications focus on this technology has increased
   dramatically. In this paper, we presented a literature review of
   articles which focus on the applications of RFID in structural
   engineering. According to the different effects of RFID in different
   stages of the lifecycle of a building, we organized these applications
   into three main categories: intelligent construction, structural health
   monitoring (SHM) and intelligent management and operation. The basic
   theory of RFID technology, the tendency and status of current researches
   were discussed in this paper. Finally, the gap and latent improvement of
   existing applications in each category were proposed. It is hoped that
   our analysis of these researches will provide meaningful information on
   the comprehension of the applications of RFID in structural engineering.},

Title = {How to define clean vehicles? Environmental impact rating of vehicles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {77-86},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How to compare the environmental damage caused by vehicles with
   different fuels and drive trains? This paper describes a methodology to
   assess the environmental impact of vehicles, using different approaches,
   and evaluating their benefits and limitations. Rating systems are
   analysed as tools to compare the environmental impact of vehicles,
   allowing decision makers to dedicate their financial and non-financial
   policies and support measures in function of the ecological damage. The
   paper is based on the ``Clean Vehicles{''} research project,
   commissioned by the Brussels Capital Region via the BIM-IBGE (Brussels
   Institute for the Conservation of the Environment) (Van Mierlo et al.,
   2001). The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (ETEC) and the Universite Libre de
   Bruxelles (CEESE) have jointly carried out the workprogramme. The most
   important results of this project are illustrated in this paper. First
   an overview of environmental, economical and technical characteristics
   of the different alternative fuels and drive trains is given. Afterward
   the basic principles to identify the environmental impact of cars are
   described. An outline of the considered emissions and their
   environmental impact leads to the definition of the calculation method,
   named Ecoscore. A rather simple and pragmatic approach would be stating
   that all alternative fuelled vehicles (LPG, CNG, EV, HEV, etc.) can be
   considered as `clean'. Another basic approach is considering as `clean'
   all vehicles satisfying a stringent emission regulation like EURO IV or
   EEV. Such approaches however don't tell anything about the real
   environmental damage of the vehicles. In the paper we describe ``how
   should the environmental impact of vehicles be defined?{''}, including
   parameters affecting the emissions of vehicles and their influence on
   human beings and on the environment and ``how could it be defined ?{''},
   taking into account the availability of accurate and reliable data. We
   take into account different damages (acid rain, photochemical air
   pollution, global warming, noise, etc.) and their impacts on several
   receptors like human beings (e.g.: cancer, respiratory diseases, etc);
   ecosystems, or buildings. The presented methodology is based on a kind
   of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in which the contribution of all
   emissions to a certain damage are considered (e.g. using
   Exposure-Response damage function). The emissions will include oil
   extraction, transportation refinery, electricity production,
   distribution, (Well-to-Wheel approach), as well as the emission due to
   the production, use and dismantling of the vehicle (Cradle-to-Grave
   approach). The different damages will be normalized to be able to make a
   comparison. Hence a reference value (determined by the reference vehicle
   chosen) will be defined as a target value (the normalized value will
   thus measure a kind of Distance to Target). The contribution of the
   different normalized damages to a single value ``EcoScore{''} will be
   based on a panel weighting method. Some examples of the calculation of
   the Ecoscore for different alternative fuels and drive trains will be
   calculated as an illustration of the methodology.},

   Processing Software},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Engineering graphics are present in the design stage, but also
   constitute a way to communicate, analyse, and synthesise. In the
   Architecture-Engineering-Construction sector, graphical data become
   essential in analysing buildings and constructions throughout their
   lifecycles, such as in the thermal behaviour assessment of building
   envelopes. Scientific research has addressed the thermal image mapping
   onto three-dimensional (3D) models for visualisation and analysis.
   However, the 3D point cloud data creation of buildings' thermal
   behaviour directly from rectified infrared thermography (IRT)
   thermograms is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this paper develops an
   open-source software graphical method to produce 3D thermal data from
   IRT images for temperature visualisation and subsequent analysis. This
   low-cost approach uses both a geographic information system for the
   thermographic image rectification and the point clouds production, and
   3D point cloud processing software. The methodology has been proven
   useful to obtain, without perspective distortions, 3D thermograms even
   from non-radiometric raster images. The results also revealed that
   non-rectangular thermograms enable over 95\% of the 3D thermal data
   generated from IRT against rectangular shapes (over 85\%). Finally, the
   3D thermal data produced allow further thermal behaviour assessment,
   including calculating the object's heat loss and thermal transmittance
   for diverse applications such as energy audits, restoration, monitoring,
   or product quality control.},

Title = {Ontology-assisted GPT-based building performance simulation and
   assessment: Implementation of multizone airflow simulation},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {325},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Building performance simulation (BPS) is crucial for building
   performance assessments across its lifecycle. However, the complexity of
   buildings and the iterative nature of simulation poses challenges,
   leading to high costs and low values. Previous studies focused on
   simplification, but did not fully utilize advanced simulation engines.
   Despite recent advancements, there is a lack of research on leveraging
   artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative pre-trained
   transformer (GPT), for BPS. Therefore, this study proposes a GPT-based
   BPS system, enhancing simulation efficiency and value by integrating
   simulation engines and advanced data analytics in the GPT environment.
   The ontology for GPT-based BPS is also developed to enable
   comprehensive, reliable, informative BPS environments. Based on this
   framework, case studies were conducted for GPT-based multizone airflow
   network simulation in a high-rise residential building using CONTAM
   software. They demonstrate GPT's capabilities in retrieving simulation
   data, visualizing results with data mining, answering questions based on
   building knowledge, checking compliance with design guidelines, and
   proposing design alternatives. Finally, this study emphasizes expert
   interventions with ontological engineering informatics to utilize
   strictly structured BPS engines.},

Abstract = {The application of computer in industrial design has become very
   important with the development of information technology and network
   technology. The computerization of design tools will change the ideology
   and management of industrial design inevitably.
   In order to solve the problem of document management, communication and
   knowledge management in industrial design, this paper studied the
   position of industrial design in product development procedure; proposed
   the architecture of a collaborative platform for industrial design based
   on Product Lifetime Management(PLM); analyzed the key technologies of
   building such a platform; and built a collaborative platform with
   features of industrial design. The platform establishes project
   management templates for industrial design and design document templates
   based on common expression mode, solves the problem of large size model
   transfer, realizes online browsing of 3D model and improves the
   communication among designers and product data sharing.
   The platform helps product design overcome the limitation of time and
   space, shortens product lifetime cycle and enhance the ability of
   personalized product development. All of the above features prove that
   this platform has preferable practicability.},

Abstract = {The number of defects alone does not provide software companies with
   enough information on the effort required to fix them. Defects have
   different impacts on the overall defect correction effort - defects
   introduced in one phase may be found and corrected in the same or later
   phase. The later they are found, the more effort is required to correct
   them. The main aim of this paper is to build and validate a model
   (Bayesian Network) for predicting the defect correction effort at
   various phases of the software development process. The procedure of
   building the model covers the following steps: problem analysis, data
   analysis, model definition and enhancement, simulation runs, and model
   validation. Developed Defect Cost Flow Model (DCFM), which is an
   implementation of the V-model of a software project lifecycle, correctly
   incorporates known qualitative and quantitative relationships.
   Application of DCFM in a real industrial process revealed its high
   potential in finding the appropriate amount of review effort for
   specific development phases to minimize the overall costs. The model may
   be used in the industry for decision support. It can be extended and
   calibrated to meet the needs of specific development environment.},

Title = {Butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin:: the
   role of natural and human-induced factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {905-915},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim We developed a model enabling us to evaluate the contribution of
   both natural and human-related factors to butterfly species richness in
   Catalonia, a Mediterranean area that harbours one of the most diverse
   butterfly faunas in Europe.
   Location The study was carried out in Catalonia (north-east Iberian
   Peninsula), a region of 31,930 km(2) lying between the Pyrenees, the
   Ebro depression and the Mediterranean sea.
   Methods Data from the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme were used to
   assess butterfly species richness from 55 transects spread all over the
   region. Three groups of environmental variables likely to affect the
   presence of butterfly species were calculated, above all from geographic
   information system data: (1) climatology and topography, (2) vegetation
   structure and (3) human disturbance. Because climatic and topographic
   variables are expected to be strongly correlated, we first performed a
   principal component analysis (PCA) to create a summarizing factor that
   would account for most of the variance within this set of variables.
   Subsequently, a backward stepwise multiple regression was performed in
   order to assess the effects of environmental factors on butterfly
   species richness.
   Results A total of 131 species were detected in the monitoring
   transects, representing 75.7\% of the butterfly fauna known from
   Catalonia. Mean species richness per transect and per year was 41.4,
   although values varied greatly among sites (range: 14-76.8). The final
   regression model explained more than 80\% of the total variance, which
   indicated a strong association between butterfly species richness and
   the studied environmental factors. The model revealed the very important
   contribution of climatic and topographic variables, which were combined
   into a single factor in the PCA. In contrast to what has been found in
   other, more northerly countries, species richness was negatively
   correlated with temperature and positively correlated with rainfall,
   except for extreme cold and wet conditions. This may be a consequence of
   the predictably adverse effects of the Mediterranean summer drought on
   herbivorous insects, and the fact that the limits of distribution of
   many butterflies correlate well with climatic variables. Human
   disturbance (defined as the proportion of urban and agricultural
   landscape cover in buffer areas of 5 km around the transect sites) was
   the second most important predictor for species richness. We found that
   a significant decrease in species numbers was associated with an
   increase in human pressure, a finding that indicates that not only
   building development, but also modern-day agricultural practices are
   detrimental to the conservation of Mediterranean butterflies.
   Surprisingly, vegetation variables had an almost negligible effect on
   butterfly species richness.
   Main conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the current motors
   of global change will have a negative effect on Mediterranean butterfly
   assemblages. First, changes in land-use are transforming and fragmenting
   the landscape into an inhospitable and less permeable matrix for
   butterflies. Secondly, the negative correlation between species richness
   and temperature will lead to a predictable loss of diversity over the
   coming years, as predicted in the most plausible scenarios of climate
   change. Considering the high butterfly richness characterizing the
   Mediterranean Basin, this future trend will pose a serious threat to
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Anaerobic digestion and integration at urban scale: feedback and
   comparative case study},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Background: The anaerobic digestion process is well studied and
   developed since the last 50 years, notably for farming implementation.
   Furthermore, the international energy agenda has shifted in favor of
   renewable resources. In this context, anaerobic digestion has been
   highlighted as a valuable source of green energy. At urban scale, since
   the 2000s, some eco-friendly districts and cities tried to integrate
   this process as valorization treatment, with different approaches and
   results. The objective of this study is to provide a feedback from these
   anaerobic digestion projects at urban scale.
   Methods: To construct this paper, 15 international projects of urban
   waste valorization were selected and studied. Three of these projects
   are developed to describe the different elements and processes implied
   in these valorization systems. Thus, in situ and ex situ anaerobic
   digestions are described with functional implementation and units in
   development or abandoned. Once the leading steps and main parameters on
   waste management system identified, the discussion is performed to
   compare the operational systems implemented in the 15 cases studies. The
   analysis takes processes and biological parameters into account in
   addition to social, financial, and ecological elements available. The
   achievements and limits of case studied linked to their context,
   bringing advice and recommendations.
   Results: From these real cases and projects, we highlighted relevant
   information for further urban waste valorization system. Among others,
   the most frequent organic deposits produced at urban scale are
   identified, as well as the typical quantities generated. Collection,
   storage, and pretreatment processes were investigated to provide
   information about how they are conducted in situ and ex situ. Concerning
   some technical points, CSTR and UASB configurations are also identified
   as predominant reactors used to lead wet AD process at urban scale, due
   to practical aspects and characteristics of feedstock. Concerning the
   digestate, nutrients contents make it an interesting fertilizer for
   agricultural valorization. To its stabilization, the composting process
   is mainly deployed after anaerobic digestion of urban waste. The
   valorization of biogas produced with in situ urban AD is generally
   performed with CHP unit, due to the small quantity of methane. When the
   valorization is operated ex situ, processes are in link with local
   users' needs and energy transition policy.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, we identified among others that available
   deposits, collection and storage processes, local grid, and scale
   mechanisms influence the urban integration of AD. Thus, anaerobic
   digestion in situ is emphasized for new district buildings with low
   urban density, while ex situ process could be more accommodated to high
   urban densities or projects including preexistent waste management. From
   the 15 case studies, co-digestion process is highlighted to perform
   global waste management and produce valuable AD reactions. Nevertheless,
   the use of blackwater, for in situ units, involves specific processes to
   limit amount of water and reduce the reactor sizing. Further knowledge
   is also currently needed about the development of collection systems for
   urban waste and the impact of pretreatment on AD. The involvement of
   scientific, economic, social, and political communities is also
   highlighted as essential for the long-term success of valorization
   system integrated at urban scale.},

Title = {Digitalizing building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) conceptual design:
   A framework and an example platform},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The design of a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system involves
   considering various factors such as geophysical, technical, economic,
   and environmental aspects throughout its lifecycle. Although many
   studies have proposed approaches to support the BIPV design process,
   there is a need for a comprehensive BIPV design framework that
   integrates climate, BIPV product, regulation, technical, and economic
   data to create optimal BIPV solutions for individual building projects.
   This study proposes a solution that provides a comprehensive solution
   for all BIPV stakeholders including those in the solar power, energy,
   construction, and regulatory fields. The study examines the process of
   designing and analyzing BIPV in Australia during the conceptual design
   phase. The study employs a literature review, semi-structured interviews
   and a questionnaire survey to investigate the current practices,
   methods, and workflows employed in BIPV design and analysis in
   Australia. The objective is to develop a framework that can facilitate
   this process. The framework includes five segments for simulation and
   analysis: Analysis of building design and solar performance, Assessment
   of BIPV system energy output, Evaluation of cost-benefit analysis for
   BIPV systems, Environmental assessment of BIPV systems, and Optimization
   of BIPV system designs. An example tool is developed based on the
   proposed framework and the effectiveness of the framework has been
   verified through a case study. The findings indicate that the suggested
   framework has the potential to assist professionals in the building
   design, construction, and BIPV industry in identifying viable BIPV
   design alternatives during the initial design phase. The proposed
   framework can serve as a valuable resource for guiding the design of
   BIPV projects in Australia, facilitating the development of efficient
   and cost-effective solutions. This, in turn, has the potential to
   promote the widespread adoption of BIPV in building projects across the
   country.},

Abstract = {Background: There is a long tradition of writing about future work in
   research papers, and information systems design science research (IS
   DSR) is no exception. However, there is a lack of studies on (1) how IS
   DSR authors currently envision the next steps for their work and (2)
   guidelines to improve the communication of opportunities to accumulate
   knowledge. Method: This paper contributes to this topic, building on a
   systematic literature review of 123 IS DSR papers published between 2018
   and 2022. Results: Design-oriented research requires the research team
   to decide which tasks to carry out immediately in building the future
   and which to postpone as research debt. The paper's contribution is
   threefold. First, we propose a research debt lifecycle to support (1)
   project stakeholders, (2) IS DSR community, and (3) societies looking
   for better futures. Second, we discuss the anatomy of future work in
   recent IS DSR. Finally, we suggest guidelines to manage and report the
   next research steps. Conclusion: This paper presents a pioneering
   assessment of future work suggestions in the IS field, focusing on the
   design science research paradigm. Future work directions emerge from
   researchers' choices during the IS DSR process that must be continuously
   managed.},

Abstract = {Oversize deformations and local damages may occur in steel structures
   due to inappropriate design, inadequacy of construction, improper uses
   and some other factors. Such damages could produce serious safety
   problems and shorten the service life of the structures. We proposed in
   this paper an effective and accurate method for analyzing the ultimate
   bearing capacity of steel framework based on the fiber hinge model and
   time-varying structure theory. A detailed study was conducted to
   investigate a cantilever column with I shaped cross section. The effects
   of cross section division and fiber hinge unit length on computation
   accuracy were investigated using SAP2000 finite element software. The
   proposed method was then applied to a real-life engineering problem, in
   which the steel structure of a mechanical building was gradually damaged
   under the action of uneven foundation settlement. The detailed
   information was obtained for the whole structural damage process as well
   as for the structural improvements after reinforcement. The results
   presented in this paper provided valuable information for strengthening
   of the damaged structures that are usually difficult to obtain in field
   detection, as well as the critical information for evaluating the
   structure conditions. In addition, the results in this paper could also
   provide useful information for safety assessment of new constructions.},

Title = {NORMATIVE MODEL OF PERSONALITY DISCOURSE SELF-DESIGNING},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Number = {11},
Pages = {105-113},
Abstract = {The relevance of the issue is determined by social demands for
   identifying ways of a personality development, aimed at self-improving,
   self-designing, the person responsible for his/her deeds and the destiny
   of the whole society, the person able to act successfully under changing
   conditions of the modern information society. The paper aims to
   characterize a normative model of discursive self-designing of a
   personality as an active life-creativity subject. Research methods:
   modeling as a method of constructing and analyzing the normative model
   of personality discursive self-designing, systematization,
   generalization and interpretation in the analysis of the content of the
   selected self-designing process stages. The result of the designed and
   presented normative model of personality's discourse selfdesigning is
   the person's maturity as the author of his/her own life. The model
   includes the following components: 1. The formation of protodesign as a
   state of uncertainty, a premonition of the desired future. 2. Creation
   of the personality prototext, based on the formation of the idea of the
   desired way of life. 3. Choosing a desired socio-cultural model. 4.
   Building a design-guide, which can be formulated in the form of a
   symbol, slogan, general idea, which reflects future meanings, values, ``
   purpose of life{''}, strategies and general reflected ways to achieve
   it. 5. Pre-event designing, in the process of which a revision and
   overflow of possible life practices take place. 6. Eventful designing,
   that is, filling the pre-event design with events. 7. Building a life
   design on the basis of life events predictable by a personality and the
   generation of the story of the desired life, which contributes to the
   implementation of the design-guide. 8. Modeling various variants
   (stories) of the life design and assessment of their viability based on
   the analysis of one's own personal resources and socio-cultural
   conditions. 9. Creating a personality design that can be interpreted as
   a design of changing personality characteristics based on the ``versions
   of himself/herself{''} chosen by a person (personality models) necessary
   for the implementation of the personality design. 10. Realization of
   personality and life designs. 11. Assessment of the success of
   personality and life designs realization, which involves transformation
   of the self-development tasks and the formulation of new ones and,
   accordingly, elaboration of both life and personality designs, or
   refusal of further selfdesigning, further personal development.},

Title = {Facility management information taxonomy framework for queries in
   healthcare buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Healthcare facilities need to ensure providing safer services to
   patients without interruptions since disease diagnosis and treatments
   highly depend on medical equipment and spaces. Therefore, facility
   management (FM) of healthcare facilities requires a clear and rapid
   information flow for decision making processes to impede possible
   interruptions. Non-availability of information, accuracy problems and
   incomplete information induce more severe problems such as cost
   overruns, reduced productivity and decrease in customer satisfaction.
   Thus, this paper aims to develop a strategic information taxonomy
   framework for FM inquiries in healthcare facilities to address the
   research problem. Design Science Research methodology cycles such as
   relevance, rigor and design are adopted during the flow of the research.
   In the relevance cycle, research requirements and the importance of
   FMITs were firstly observed with two scenarios, then in the rigor cycle,
   64 FM information types (FMITs) were determined, classified and refined
   under three categories such as; managerial, technical, and financial as
   a result of literature review and pilot study. Determined FMITs were
   analyzed with newly developed MonteCarlo Simulation and TOPSIS
   Techniques on healthcare facilities. As a result of analysis, 62 FMITs
   were found important for healthcare facilities. The most important FM
   Informations Types were found as ``identification of hazardous or other
   risks to people or property{''} (0,985), ``real-time operation
   parameters/post occupancy data integration{''} (0,939), and ``predicted
   lifetime of assets{''} (0,818) in managerial, technical and financial
   information types respectively. Finally, in design cycle, facility
   management information taxonomy, which was created from determined
   FMITs, and importance levels of determined FMITs were evaluated with two
   case studies. Results showed that while maintenance contracts have a
   positive impact to prevent negative impact of costs, they can cause
   interruption in information management in facility management.
   Additionally, there are some view difference in professions. For
   example, construction management literature focuses wastes that are
   incurred at the end of building lifecycle or construction process.
   However, there aren't much attention to manage wastes that occurred
   during operation and maintenance stage. Beside this, regulations and
   standards have importance to store, use and manage FMITs. The analysis
   results acknowledged that the use of information taxonomy framework can
   increase the effectiveness of the healthcare FM.},

Title = {Big Data and Its Applications in Smart Real Estate and the Disaster
   Management Life Cycle: A Systematic Analysis},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated
   daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and
   internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of
   better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a
   challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as
   the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be
   tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing
   and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data
   in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic
   analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data
   and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a
   recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to
   top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search
   engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed
   down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were
   conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis,
   keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors' names,
   countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field
   of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data
   lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and
   research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with
   interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management,
   data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further
   show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the
   seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value,
   visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods
   for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions
   were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to
   ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient.
   The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage,
   retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data,
   which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and
   encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure
   Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation,
   building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks,
   checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State
   Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of
   frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including
   Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture
   the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful,
   swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in
   two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and
   disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for
   field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas
   through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big
   data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to
   poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate
   to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization
   that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the
   customers by the sellers and real estate managers.
   Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media,
   drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural
   disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan
   emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real
   estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from
   the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities
   management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with
   the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help
   prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.},

Abstract = {Many researchers found high potential of adopting building photovoltaic
   (PV) systems in urban areas, especially on building rooftop, to improve
   the sustainability of urban environment. However, the optimal energy
   output performance and economic benefit of the PV system are affected by
   the usable roof area, PV array layout, and shading effect considering
   high city density. This study aims to understand the effects of these
   design parameters in the urban environment of rooftop PV's economic
   performance. This study carries out a case study in the urban area of
   Melbourne with 90 PV designs under three shading conditions to generate
   270 scenarios. Through a lifecycle cost-benefit analysis, including net
   present value (NPV), NPV per kW, internal return rate (IRR), and payback
   year, the results can help in developing a comprehensive understanding
   of the economic performance of rooftop PV designs that cover most of the
   urban areas of Melbourne. The optimal PV design scenarios for the urban
   environment are identified, thereby providing investors and industry
   professionals with useful information on value-for-money PV design.
   Meanwhile, the maximum shading loss that makes the PV systems
   financially unfeasible is investigated, and design scenarios with
   greatest ability to sustain the shading effect are identified. This
   research can also support the policy makers' decision on the development
   and deployment of the roof PV systems in urban planning.},

Abstract = {Pyroclastic flows clearly present a serious threat to life for the
   inhabitants of settlements on the slopes of volcanoes with a history of
   explosive eruptions; but it is increasingly realised that buildings can
   provide a measure of protection to occupants trapped by such flows. One
   important example is Vesuvius, whose eruption history includes many
   events which were lethal for the inhabitants of the neighbouring
   Vesuvian villages. Recent computational fluid dynamics computer
   modelling for Vesuvius {[}Todesco et al., Bull. Volcanol. 64 (2002)
   155-177] has enabled a realistic picture of an explosive eruption to be
   modelled, tracing the time-dependent development of the physical
   parameters of a simulated flow at a large three-dimensional mesh of
   points, based on assumed conditions of temperature, mass-flow rate and
   particle size distribution at the vent. The output includes mapping of
   temperature, mixture density and mixture velocity over the whole
   adjacent terrain. But to date this information has not been used to
   assess the impacts of such flows on buildings and their occupants. In
   the project reported in this paper, estimates of the near-ground flow
   parameters were used to assess the impact of a particular simulated
   pyroclastic flow (modelled roughly on the 1631 eruption) on the
   buildings and population in four of the Vesuvian villages considered
   most at risk. The study had five components. First, a survey of
   buildings and the urban environment was conducted to identify the
   incidence of characteristics and elements likely to affect human
   vulnerability, and to classify the building stock. The survey emphasised
   particularly the number, location and type of openings characteristic of
   the major classes of the local building stock. In the second part of the
   study, this survey formed the basis for estimates of the probable impact
   of the pyroclastic flow on the envelope and internal air conditions of
   typical buildings. In the third part, a number of distinct ways in which
   human casualties would occur were identified, and estimates were made of
   the relationship between casualty rates and environmental conditions for
   each casualty type. In the fourth part of the study, the assumed
   casualty rates were used to estimate the proportions of occupants who
   would be killed or seriously injured for the assumed pyroclastic flow
   scenario in the Vesuvian villages studied, and their distribution by
   distance from the vent. It was estimated that in a daytime eruption, 25
   min after the start of the eruption, there would be 480 deaths and a
   further 190 serious injuries, for every 1000 remaining in the area. In a
   night-time scenario, there would be 360 deaths with a further 230
   serious injuries per 1000 after the same time interval. Finally, a set
   of risk factors for casualties was identified, and factors were
   discussed and ranked for their mitigation impact in the eruption
   scenario. The most effective mitigation action would of course be total
   evacuation before the start of the eruption. But if this were not
   achieved, barred window openings or sealed openings to slow the ingress
   of hot gases, together with a reduction of the fire load, could be
   effective means of reducing casualty levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Using semantic annotations on political debate videos for building open
   government based lawmaking},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The traditional concept and practice of lawmaking is being transformed
   by the open government paradigm. It involves a new digital model that
   links three principles: transparency, participation and collaboration.
   However, the information system-enabled solutions in this context are
   still in their infancy, which none available that address the three
   crucial challenges: (1) providing the functionalities for semantic
   search and retrieval of video clips on political debates about
   legislative proposals, (2) support of open participation and
   collaboration with contextual information in lawmaking processes and,
   (3) automatic generation of outcomes achieved in the lawmaking
   lifecycle. In this article, we describe the underlying methods and
   techniques leading to address these challenges when a semantic-driven
   approach is applied for the development and validation of the real-world
   scenario of open government-based lawmaking systems. To evaluate the
   value created by using a semantic-driven approach as computational
   backbone, the development and testing of a software platform as case
   study was carried out together with experts from a parliamentary
   institution and analysed the user experience in parliamentary settings
   with end-users. The results show how the use of the appropriate
   techniques for the adoption of a semantic assumption is a key enabler
   for the management and retrieval of information tasks relating to the
   lawmaking lifecycle providing a transparent, participatory and
   collaborative approach in a holistic way.},

Title = {Countering Service Information Challenges in the Internet of Services},
Journal = {BUSINESS \& INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Number = {5},
Pages = {370+},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Business Webs apply the idea of value networks to the WWW. The
   underlying delivery platform is commonly referred to as the Internet of
   Services and will certainly have to deal with a great variety and amount
   of information about services along several service information
   dimensions. As soon as brokerage, discovery, or community feedback parts
   are decentralized, there emerge a number of service information
   challenges (modeling the information in a holistic way, documentation,
   interlinkage, tool interoperability, distributed querying, inconsistent
   information, and cooperation of different stakeholders). In this paper,
   we propose to counter such service information challenges by two
   artifacts. First, we contribute a Service Ontology based on a sound and
   rigid foundational ontology. The Service Ontology provides a holistic
   and consistent way of capturing service information. We apply the
   recommendations of the W3C Semantic Web Activity whose recent
   standardization has already opened new possibilities for tool
   interoperability, interlinkage of information, and distributed querying
   on the web. However, building and prescribing an ontology in
   standardized languages is not enough to address all service information
   challenges. Therefore, as a second contribution, we provide a method
   around the ontology including a governance framework, guidelines for
   applying the W3C Semantic Web recommendations, a lifecycle-spanning tool
   chain, and different levels of applicability. We label our method
   Semantic Business Web approach, since we build on W3C Semantic Web
   standards, use and extend them in the Business Web setting. Both
   artifacts are constructed in an interdisciplinary way by experts
   participating in the German lighthouse project THESEUS/TEXO. The
   project's scenario also serves as a proof of concept evaluation of the
   artifacts.},

Title = {The impacts of green claims on coffee consumers' purchase intention},
Journal = {BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {117},
Number = {1},
Pages = {195-209},
Abstract = {Purpose - As huge environmental impacts caused by the coffee industry
   are significant and controversial in the course from cultivation to
   consumption, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether or not
   different types of green claims based on the product lifecycle can lead
   to different extents of green psychological variables including purchase
   intention.
   Design/methodology/approach - The green claims of Starbucks were chosen
   as the research target for this study not only because the coffee chain
   store is working on the ``Starbucks{''} Shared Planet' program, which
   makes a commitment to do business in ways that are good for people and
   the planet, but also because such a program can be categorized into
   three major green message elements on the basis of the product
   lifecycle. A total of 920 valid self-reported questionnaires collected
   in Taiwan were used for this empirical analysis.
   Findings - One-way ANOVA results reveal that all of the three green
   claims of Starbucks can lead to consumers building up the same level of
   green brand image of this company, with ``ethical sourcing{''}
   significantly possessing more impacts on the other green psychological
   variables (i.e. green trust, green satisfaction, green brand equity, and
   green purchase intention).
   Practical implications - The empirical results and findings from this
   study are helpful to the coffee industry marketers if they, in
   formulating various promotion campaigns, can communicate with the
   consumers with an eye to increasing their green brand image and other
   green psychological variables, including green purchase intention.
   Originality/value - This study is among the first to introduce different
   types of green claims on a basis of the product lifecycle to examine
   whether or not consumers' green psychological variables will be
   different.},

Abstract = {Since early cybernetics studies by Wiener, Pask, and Ashby, the
   properties of living systems are subject to deep investigations. The
   goals of this endeavour are both understanding and building: abstract
   models and general principles are sought for describing organisms, their
   dynamics and their ability to produce adaptive behavior. This research
   has achieved prominent results in fields such as artificial intelligence
   and artificial life. For example, today we have robots capable of
   exploring hostile environments with high level of self-sufficiency,
   planning capabilities and able to learn. Nevertheless, the discrepancy
   between the emergence and evolution of life and artificial systems is
   still huge. In this paper, we identify the fundamental elements that
   characterize the evolution of the biosphere and open-ended evolution,
   and we illustrate their implications for the evolution of artificial
   systems. Subsequently, we discuss the most relevant issues and questions
   that this viewpoint poses both for biological and artificial systems.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for evaluating facilities in regard
   to their designed intelligence. Facilities intelligence is defined as
   the designed capacity of a facility to acquire and process data and
   information to perform its adaptability to lifecycle circumstance
   changes in terms of people's requirements of wellbeing and energy
   efficiency. This definition is then formulated to quantify the Index of
   Facilities Intelligence, the level of facilities intelligence, and the
   reliability of facilities evaluation. STEEP (social, technical,
   economic, environmental, and political) criteria and their sub-criteria
   are used to set up an ANP (analytic network process) model, and ANP
   result such as synthesized priority weights is then used to calculate
   those parameters related to facilities intelligence. An experimental
   case study is given to prove the effectiveness of applying the proposed
   method to evaluate the intelligence of facilities in practice. (C) 2009

Abstract = {We present a whole-cell fully dynamical kinetic model (WCM) of
   JCVI-syn3A, a minimal cell with a reduced genome of 493 genes that has
   retained few regulatory proteins or small RNAs. Cryo-electron tomograms
   provide the cell geometry and ribosome distributions. Time-dependent
   behaviors of concentrations and reaction fluxes from
   stochastic-deterministic simulations over a cell cycle reveal how the
   cell balances demands of its metabolism, genetic information processes,
   and growth, and offer insight into the principles of life for this
   minimal cell. The energy economy of each process including active
   transport of amino acids, nucleosides, and ions is analyzed. WCM reveals
   how emergent imbalances lead to slowdowns in the rates of transcription
   and translation. Integration of experimental data is critical in
   building a kinetic model from which emerges a genome-wide distribution
   of mRNA half-lives, multiple DNA replication events that can be compared
   to qPCR results, and the experimentally observed doubling behavior.},

Abstract = {Man-machine collaboration will be the main way to work with robots join
   in human life in the future. This article introduces the man-machine
   collaboration model into the curtain wall installation of current
   construction, aiming to establish a man-machine collaboration system
   that can be used in actuality. Firstly, this article establishes a whole
   dynamic model including operator, collaborative robot and environment,
   then transforms it into an equivalent two-port model. In order to
   analyze the operating performance of the system quantificationally, this
   article introduces and analyzes the transparency of the system to
   represent the ability the operator using tactile senses to perceive the
   environment through the collaborative robot. Finally, through the
   experiments of three kinds of typical external force, the system got the
   feedback data collected from the environment. The results show that the
   interaction controller can truly reflect the external environment acting
   on the end effector of the cooperative robot, which is an important
   reference for the operator to control the cooperative robot.},

Abstract = {During last years, the federated interoperability framework (FIF) has
   been developed by Airbus Group Innovation (AGI) for establishing
   sustainable Product and Process data interoperability. FIF combines
   usage of open standards for Manufacturing, Information Systems (IS) and
   Information \& Communication Technologies (ICT). FIF evolvability was
   demonstrated by addressing successively Concurrent Engineering and
   Collaborative Product design in Virtual Enterprises. Due to the
   considered complex systems, FIF uses Enterprise Modelling (EM) and Model
   Driven Approach (MDAp) for preparing and building operational
   interoperability. Interconnected enterprise platforms behaviour and data
   flows are derived from business logic models. When exchanging data, FIF
   prevents data loss and semantic inconsistency relying on ontology: a
   semantic hyper-graph is produced per collaboration. Equivalent
   constructs of all the languages used in the MDAp are mapped for
   conceptualisation, design, development and realisation. But it requires
   more when addressing the complexity of the considered systems. Using
   semantic graphs and descriptive logic is not suited when dealing with
   multi-scale models and the various breakdowns with different
   granularity. This paper describes an innovative approach for extending
   the FIF, relying on modelling over UML2/SysML and introduces
   mereotopology. Usage is illustrated with a comprehensive use case
   combining Manufacturing 4.0 and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) of
   the future.},

Abstract = {Modern trend in operation and development of energy systems is to rely
   on data both in low-level control and strategic decisions. So, there is
   an urgent need in real-life data available for researchers and
   practioneers. We collected and published online data on real-time
   functioning of the energy grid of the Trapeznikov Institute of Control
   Sciences (ICS), a mediumsized research institution. The energy consumers
   in the ICS campus include office equipment, HVAC systems, elevators,
   cooking facilities, and some research equipment such as 3-d printers and
   CNC machines. The buildings are powered by a hundred of 3-phase (220/380
   V, 50 Hz) lines, equipped with smart energy meters. The dataset includes
   electric measurements such as active and reactive power, voltage and
   current collected at 1/15 - 1 Hz. The dataset also contains local
   weather and indoor climate measurements. Currently, the data are
   available for several months of 2020 and the whole 2021 year. We intend
   them to be used for several purposes. First, the data provide some
   insights into energy consumption patterns. Second, it may be used as a
   testbed for load prediction algorithms. Third, we provide separate
   measurements for each of the power lines which constitute the aggregate
   consumption of the buildings. One may consider an energy disaggregation
   problem where ground-truth labeling is provided not for every device,
   but at the higher level like several rooms with multiple devices. We
   believe our data will contribute to the research of smart energy
   systems. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is facing a data tsunami, while emerging
   information technologies (IT) show great potential for the effective
   processing of these data or information. However, a comprehensive review
   for technological change, the resulting process, and organizational
   changes in the Big Data context, especially from the angle of whole

   works published in the databases of Web of Science, Science Direct, and
   American Society of Civil Engineers library are systematically reviewed.
   The general trend in emerging IT application in terms of construction
   project management (CPM) phases, technology and application, and
   research topics are revealed. Following this analysis, the
   particularized proposals in relation to each of the main topics within
   CPM is discussed. Furthermore, according to the advances and limitations
   of the current literature, corresponding future agendas such as the
   implementation of comprehensive data-driven CPM scenario are proposed to
   bridge the gaps between theoretical research and practical demands.},

Abstract = {Nowadays more and more industrial design activities adopt the strategy
   of Concurrent Engineering (CE), which changes the way to carry out all
   the activities along the product's lifecycle from sequential to
   parallel. Various experts of different activities produce technical data
   using domain-specific software. To augment the interoperability among
   the technical data, a Digital Mock-Up (DMU), or a Building Information
   Model (BIM) in architectural engineering can be used. Through an
   appropriate Computer-Human Interface (CHI), each expert has his/her own
   point-of-view (POV) of a specific representation of DMU's technical data
   according to an involved domain. When multiple experts work
   collaboratively in the same place and at the same time, the number of
   CHIs is also multiplied by the number of experts. Instead of multiple
   CHIs, therefore, a unique CHI should be developed to support the
   multiview and multi-interaction collaborative works. Our contributions
   in this paper are (a) a concept of a CHI system with multi-view and
   multi-interaction of DMU for multiple users in collaborative design; (b)
   a state of the art of multi-view and multi-interaction metaphors; (c) an
   experiment to evaluate a collaborative application using multi-view CHI.
   The experimental results indicate that, in multi-view CHI working
   condition, users are more efficient than in the other two working
   conditions (multiple CHIs and split view CHI). Moreover, in multi-view
   CHI working condition, the user, who is helping the other, takes less
   mutual awareness of where the other collaborator works than the other
   two working conditions.},

Title = {Multi-objective integrated optimization of geothermal heating system
   with energy storage using digital twin technology},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {252},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Heat energy storage technology plays a significant role in energy
   systems, and the various technological solutions brought about by
   digitalization are especially valuable in the field of energy storage.
   This article proposes an innovative model based on digital twin
   technology to solve the supply-demand mismatch problem in geothermal
   heating systems. This model achieves multi-objective optimization of
   comprehensive cost, geothermal energy utilization rate, and carbon
   emission by constructing a heat storage geothermal heating system.
   Digital twin technology integrates data and information models of public
   buildings and facilitates their sharing and transmission throughout the
   entire lifecycle of the geothermal heating system. Initially, the
   proposed method employs a machine learning-based approach to accurately
   predict heating demand. Subsequently, the operation of the heat storage
   water tank and heat pump units is optimized to resolve difficulties in
   matching energy supply and demand. Finally, the method takes full
   advantage of time-of-use electricity pricing policies to reduce costs.
   The data utilized were collected from an office building in China over a
   period of six months. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) In
   terms of predicting heating demand, the improved neural network proposed
   in this study achieved a prediction accuracy of 98\%, which is a 10\%
   improvement over comparative algorithms. Additionally, the experimental
   comparison of four types of errors showed that the machine learning
   method proposed had smaller errors across the board. (2) The method
   realized collaborative multi-objective optimization, and in five
   scenarios, the comprehensive performance index increased by up to
   38.03\% compared to the benchmark system. This indicates that
   intelligent technology is an effective means of enhancing the energy
   sustainability of geothermal heating systems, and the use of geothermal
   energy as a clean energy source effectively addresses issues related to
   the storage, utilization, management, and energy conservation of
   buildings.},

Abstract = {NASA is conducting the Airspace Technology Demonstration-2 to evaluate
   an Integrated Arrival, Departure, and Surface (IADS) traffic management
   system. The IADS system is powered by real-time System Wide Information
   Management feeds which provide an accurate and high fidelity view of the

   there is opportunity for third party service providers to offer this

   investigates the gate conflict prediction problem as a concrete use case
   which could help drive efficiencies. We model gate conflicts as a
   regression problem and describe the iterative process of model building,
   model validation, and evaluation used to assess the efficacy of our
   approach. We quantify our predictive accuracy and identify paths for
   improvement. Through this iterative process we hope to evolve our models
   and methods to a near real-time prediction service.},

Abstract = {Higher education courses are increasingly created as student organized
   collections of interrelated modules. At the same time, frequent change
   of subject matter and knowledge in its background must be handled. Above
   and other factors created and recognized a need for efficient computer
   based course management. Conventional computer aided teaching methods
   are not suitable to organize, manage, and communicate the comprehensive
   course information any more. The authors considered an analogy with
   well-organized computer descriptions of interrelated objects in the form
   of comprehensive integrated models in product engineering. Modeling and
   management of information serve engineering activities during lifecycle
   of product. Relevant advanced characteristics of integrated product
   descriptions are process orientation, definition of application oriented
   building elements called as features, and assistance of decisions by
   knowledge representations. The authors considered higher education
   course as one kind of product and proposed a course model. They focused
   to integrating student, teacher, and institute demand driven
   characteristics of modeling. Model is developed for application by
   course procedures. While conventional virtual education systems
   concentrate to computer mediated distance education, the authors
   considered arbitrary mix of campus and distance styles of education. In
   this paper, the authors first give an introduction in their approach to
   classroom modeling by a comparison of conventional distance education,
   conventional virtual classroom, and the proposed model based virtual
   classroom. Next, functional elements of the proposed course modeling and
   components of virtual classroom are explained. Conflicts as consequences
   of inappropriate capability or breaking of human intent are analyzed.
   Following this, initial conditions for definition of course module and
   construction of course module using modification by features are
   detailed. Finally, future work for implementation of the modeling in an
   experimental system composed by professional product lifecycle
   management (PLM) system, configurable virtual teaching environment, its
   virtual classroom extension and virtual classroom extension to the
   engineering modeling system is concluded.},

Pages = {240-251},
Abstract = {Background: Bioluminescence is a unique and significant phenomenon in
   nature. Bioluminescence is important for the lifecycle of some organisms
   and is valuable in biomedical research, including for gene expression
   analysis and bioluminescence imaging technology. In recent years,
   researchers have identified a number of methods for predicting
   bioluminescent proteins (BLPs), which have increased in accuracy, but
   could be further improved.
   Methods: In this study, a new bioluminescent proteins prediction method,
   based on a voting algorithm, is proposed. Four methods of feature
   extraction based on the amino acid sequence were used. 314 dimensional
   features in total were extracted from amino acid composition,
   physicochemical properties and k-spacer amino acid pair composition. In
   order to obtain the highest MCC value to establish the optimal
   prediction model, a voting algorithm was then used to build the model.To
   create the best performing model, the selection of base classifiers and
   vote counting rules are discussed.
   Results: The proposed model achieved 93.4\% accuracy, 93.4\% sensitivity
   and 91.7\% specificity in the test set, which was better than any other
   method. a previous prediction of bioluminescent proteins in three
   lineages was also improved using the model building method, resulting in

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of objects, devices,
   machines, vehicles, buildings, and other physical systems with embedded
   sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, that sense and share
   and act on real-time information about the physical world. These
   objects, through standard communication protocols and unique addressing
   schemes provide services to the final users or systems. With the rise of
   low cost, low power single board computers, it is possible to perform
   certain business logic at the edge of the network utilizing such
   computers. This way the IoT application is distributed across many
   devices, some running at or near the edge of the network, at different
   locations and some running in the public or private cloud. This brings
   in new research and development challenges in the lifecycle of IoT
   applications, including modeling, deployment and support of
   non-functional requirements such as security, privacy, performance,
   provenance etc. In this paper we outline the challenges related to
   modeling and deployment of IoT applications and potential research
   directions in resolving these challenges.},

Abstract = {Engaging citizens with digital technology to co-create data, information
   and knowledge has widely become an important strategy for informing the
   policy response to COVID-19 and the `infodemic' of misinformation in
   cyberspace. This move towards digital citizen participation aligns well
   with the United Nations' agenda to encourage the use of digital tools to
   enable data-driven, direct democracy. From data capture to information
   generation, and knowledge co-creation, every stage of the data lifecycle
   bears important considerations to inform policy and practice. Drawing on
   evidence of participatory policy and practice during COVID-19, we
   outline a framework for citizen `e-participation' in knowledge
   co-creation across every stage of the policy cycle. We explore how
   coupling the generation of information with that of social capital can
   provide opportunities to collectively build trust in institutions,
   accelerate recovery and facilitate the `e-society'. We outline the key
   aspects of realising this vision of data-driven direct democracy by
   discussing several examples. Sustaining participatory knowledge
   co-creation beyond COVID-19 requires that local organisations and
   institutions (e.g. academia, health and welfare, government, business)
   incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms into their operational and
   governance structures, their integrated service models, as well as
   employing emerging social innovations.},

Abstract = {The article presents studies aimed at the formation of an adaptive
   management system based on the information approach and digitalization
   of management processes. A conceptual dynamic model of an adaptive
   control system for large-scale and technically complex construction
   objects, consisting of two control loops with a description of their
   functional purpose, is proposed. The material proposes a programming
   technique based on the schedule of key project events, which is the
   basis for building a reference model for project implementation. In
   turn, the reference model is the main element of the adaptive control
   loop, represented by transition operators written in a matrix form
   convenient for machine use. Based on the resource approach for the
   effective development of control actions, it is proposed to distinguish
   three levels of management decisions: operational, tactical and
   strategic. The interfaces and services of the adaptive control system
   are systematized and classified, as a description of its digital
   profile. The study presents the results of the practical implementation
   of the proposed approaches by the author's software package, which is
   the basis for the formation of an adaptive control system.},

Abstract = {Mobile applications are one of the most common software projects written
   nowadays. The software architectures used for building those type of
   products heavily impacts their lifecycle as the architectural issues
   affect the internal quality of a software system hindering its
   maintainability and extensibility. We are presenting a novel approach,
   Clustering ARchitecture Layers (CARL), for detecting architectural
   layers using an automatic method that could represent the first step in
   the identification and elimination of various architectural smells.
   Unlike supervised Machine Learning approaches, the involved clustering
   method does not require any initial training data or modelling phase to
   set up the detecting system. As a further key of novelty, the method
   works by considering as codebase's hybrid features the information
   inferred from both module dependency graph and the mobile SDKs. Our
   approach considers and fuses various types of structural as well as
   lexical dependencies extracted from the codebase, it analyses the types
   of the components, their methods signatures as well as their properties.
   Our method is a generic one and can be applied to any presentational
   applications that use SDKs for building their user interfaces. We assess
   the effectiveness of our proposed layer detection approach over three
   public and private codebases of various dimensions and complexities.
   External and internal clustering metrics were used to evaluate the
   detection quality, obtaining an Average Accuracy of 77,95\%. Moreover,
   the Precision measure was computed for each layer of the investigated
   codebase architectures and the average of this metric (over all layers
   and codebases) is 79,32\% while the average Recall on all layers
   obtained is 75,93\%.},
