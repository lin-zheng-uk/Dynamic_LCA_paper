Title = {Predicting whole-life carbon emissions for buildings using different
   machine learning algorithms: A case study on typical residential
   properties in Cornwall, UK},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Whole-life carbon emissions (WLCE) studies are critical in assessing the
   environmental impact of buildings and promoting sustainable design
   practices. However, existing methods for estimating WLCE are
   time-consuming and data-intensive, limiting their usefulness in the
   early building design stages. In response to this, this research
   introduces a novel approach by harnessing various machine learning
   algorithms to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity (normalised by floor area)
   for buildings. To evaluate the suitability of machine learning
   algorithms, we conducted an experiment involving ten algorithms to build
   the prediction models. These models were trained using data from 150
   typical residential properties in Cornwall, UK, along with 28 features
   obtained from a comprehensive survey, including floor area, heating
   type, and occupant characteristics. The ten algorithms include Multiple
   Linear Regression, and non-linear algorithms such as Decision Tree,
   Random Forest. Performance evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of
   determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), means squared error
   (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and elapsed time, were employed.
   Our research contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of
   machine learning models in predicting building WLCE. We reveal that all
   the tested machine learning algorithms have the capability to predict
   WLCE and WLCE intensity, non-linear models outperform linear ones, and
   the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates superior performance in terms
   of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This research encourages the
   integration of life cycle studies into the early design stage, even
   within tight building design schedules, offering practical guidance to
   architects and designers. Furthermore, these results also benefit a wide
   range of stakeholders, not only the architects but also the engineers,
   policymakers, and life cycle assessment (LCA) researchers, contributing
   to the advancement of data-driven sustainability approaches within the
   building sector.},

Title = {A multi-objective optimization strategy for building carbon emission
   from the whole life cycle perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {262},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This research proposed an integrated strategy for building performance
   optimization from the whole life cycle perspective to explore the
   optimal building scheme. After the feature elimination, the ensemble
   learning model (ELM) was trained to obtain a high-precision model for
   predicting life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle costs (LCC),
   and indoor discomfort hours (IDH). Then, the optimal optimization
   algorithm was selected among three different optimization algorithms.
   Finally, the best building scheme was chosen according to the newly
   proposed solution. The results showed that the ELM could achieve high
   prediction efficiency by combining input feature evaluation and
   screening, multi-sampling methods, and hyperparameter optimization. The
   R2 value of ELM can reach 0.980, while the Two-Archive Evolutionary
   Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimi-zation (C-TAEA) was the
   optimal optimization algorithm. The best equilibrium solution proposed
   in this study solved the problem of different optimization ranges of
   different objectives and maximized the optimization value. Finally, the
   best equilibrium scheme reduced the LCCE by 34.7\%, the LCC by 13.9\%,
   and the IDH by 26.6\%. Therefore, this strategy can efficiently optimize
   building objectives and produce a more balanced and optimal building
   scheme, thus making it widely applicable in building performance
   optimization.},

Abstract = {We have developed a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) intrusion
   detection framework that employs ML ensembles of both supervised and
   unsupervised classifiers that are complementary in reaching a
   corroborated classification decision. Our work has been limited to DDoS
   attack detection techniques. We propose to extend our framework to
   general ML system development, based on our review of current ML system
   development life cycles. We also propose to augment the general life
   cycle model to include security features to enable building security-in
   as the development progresses and bolt security-on as flaws are
   discovered after deployment. Most ML systems today operate in a
   black-box mode, providing users with only the predictions without
   associated reasoning as to how the predictions are brought about. There
   is heavy emphasis now to build mechanisms that help the user develop
   higher confidence in accepting the predictions of ML systems. Such
   explainability feature of ML model predictions is a must for critical
   systems. We also propose to augment our lifecycle model with
   explainability features. Thus, our ultimate goal is to develop a generic
   ML lifecycle process augmented with security and explainability
   features. Such an ML lifecycle process will be of immense use in ML
   systems development for all domains.},

Abstract = {Numerous costs are associated with the design, construction,
   installation, operation, maintenance, and deconstruction of a building
   or building system. One of the challenges usually faced by an
   organization's capital planning department and/or facility management
   department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly
   estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the
   programming phase when no building design is available. To provide
   facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to
   assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are
   developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple
   building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to
   predict facilities' LCC-initial design and construction cost, utility
   cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors
   propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using
   data provided by building systems. The corresponding domain
   ontology-LCCA-Onto-is also presented. The proposed approach provides
   organizations who own multiple facilities with an innovative solution to
   the LCC prediction issue.},

Title = {A novel LCSA-Machine learning based optimization model for sustainable
   building design-A case study of energy storage systems},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) in the built environment has
   increasingly drawn researchers' attention in the preceding years;
   however, the lack of an integrated LCSA based model is still a barrier
   for its effective implementation into the building design process. This
   paper proposes a new comprehensive LCSA model to be integrated into the
   design process of new buildings and energy refurbishment scenarios of
   existing ones. The proposed model consists of sets of mathematic
   equations to describe LCSA pillars of buildings, including Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and Social Life Cycle
   Assessment (SLCA) as the intermediate indices. A final LCSA index is
   then provided to describe a design scenario's performance from an LCSA
   perspective using the authors' new formulation and weighting method. The
   model is also integrated into the optimization process and enhanced with
   Machine Learning (ML) methods to accelerate the design-assessment
   process while preserving its accuracy. Finally, given the transition
   towards buildings' electrification by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs),
   as a supportive technology, the size-optimization of a residential
   building's short-term thermal and electrical Energy Storage Systems
   (ESSs) is chosen to demonstrate the model's capabilities. For this
   purpose, the building case study is parametrically modeled in
   Grasshopper, Energy plus, and Matlab for energy analysis, data
   processing, and machine learning.},

Title = {A machine learning based method for parametric environmental impact
   model for electric vehicles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {454},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Environmental managers attempt to increasingly incorporate precautionary
   principles into decision making. The literature lacks Machine Learning
   -based approaches for forewarning lifecycle environmental impacts. This
   paper proposes a method to support electric vehicle design. The main
   innovation of the work lays in merging Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and
   Machine Learning foundations to provide support and awareness to
   designers. The present approach overcomes the present literature because
   it provides a method for the design phase, is based on a wellestablished
   methodology (LCA) and provides quantitative results from little inputs.
   The approach exploits machine Learning Methods to develop models with
   the design features of a generic electric vehicle (such as vehicle mass
   and distance traveled) in six phases (Problem definition; Data
   collection; Data Preparation; Modeling; Model evaluation; Model
   interpretation). Differently from existing environmental analyses, all
   stages of the product life cycle have been considered in building the
   database; moreover, the model provides quantitative results. Regression
   models and supervised algorithms were used. The obtained model can be
   used by product engineers, as well as those not experts on LCA.
   Moreover, the model guarantees the database and hypothesis `s
   uniqueness, ensuring the results coherence and comparability. The level
   of accuracy obtained in the case study (error or 17\%) is comparable
   with studies handling full environmental analysis (that should be more
   accurate), and outstanding, as the present case is for the design phase.
   Future works will focus on additional significative indicators, similar
   electric vehicle design and integration with prospective LCA approaches.},

Title = {Building life-span prediction for life cycle assessment and life cycle
   cost using machine learning: A big data approach},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) are two primary
   methods used to assess the environmental and economic feasibility of
   building construction. An estimation of the building's life span is
   essential to carrying out these methods. However, given the diverse
   factors that affect the building's life span, it was estimated typically
   based on its main structural type. However, different buildings have
   different life spans. Simply assuming that all buildings with the same
   structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious
   estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records
   describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the
   actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span
   prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning.
   The prediction models examined in this study produced root mean square
   errors of 3.72-4.6 and the coefficients of determination of 0.932-0.955.
   Among those models, a deep-learning based prediction model was found the
   most powerful. As anticipated, the conventional method of determining a
   building's life expectancy using a discrete set of specific factors and
   associated assumptions of life span did not yield realistic results.
   This study demonstrates that an application of deep learning to the LCA
   and LCC of a building is a promising direction, effectively guiding
   business planning and critical decision making throughout the
   construction process.},

Title = {Challenges in implementing data-driven approaches for building life
   cycle energy assessment: A review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {160},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, the construction sector's energy consumption
   has increased tremendously. Buildings consume both embodied energy (EE)
   and operational energy (OE) during their life cycle. EE is consumed by
   processes associated with construction, whereas OE is spent operating
   the building. Studies show that improving the operational efficiency of
   a building may have serious implications for EE. Building life cycle
   energy assessments (LCEA) is, therefore, essential to understanding the
   dichotomy between EE and OE. In recent years, increased availability and
   accessibility of large-scale data have made data-driven approaches a
   popular choice for building performance assessments. In this context,
   numerous review articles have highlighted and tracked current trends in
   building load prediction methods. While this work is significant, there
   remains a lack of reviews focusing on data-driven approaches from a
   building life cycle energy perspective. In this paper, we conduct a
   systematic review of literature to identify key factors hindering the
   application of machine learning techniques specifically for building
   LCEA. They include: (i) issues of data collection, quality, and
   availability; (ii) lack of standardized methodologies; and (iii)
   temporal representativeness and granularity of prediction. Finally, we
   discuss potential solutions, future directions, and research
   opportunities for data-driven LCEA research.},

Abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been used for predicting

   machine learning models for the complete life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis

   generalizable framework for developing facility LCC analysis machine
   learning models. This framework specifies the data requirements,
   methods, and expected results in each step of the model development
   process. First, a literature review and a questionnaire survey were
   conducted to determine the independent variables affecting facility LCC
   and to identify the potential data sources. The process of using raw
   data to derive LCC components is then discussed. Finally, a
   proof-of-concept case study was conducted on a university campus to
   demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. This research
   concludes that current building systems already contain the data for LCC
   analysis and that the proposed framework is effective in facility LCC

Title = {Improving building resilience in the face of future climate uncertainty:
   A comprehensive framework for enhancing building life cycle performance},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {302},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This research introduces an innovative resilient design framework,
   addressing gaps in building performance optimization by considering a
   holistic life cycle perspective and factoring in climate projection
   uncertainties from the 2020s to 2090s. The study concludes that in the
   case study, future climate scenarios in different Shared Socio-Economic
   Paths significantly impact building life cycle performance, with wall
   U-value, windows U-value, and wall density identified as major factors
   affecting building performance under future climate uncertainty. The
   ensemble learning model achieves high fidelity in predicting life cycle
   carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle cost (LCC), and indoor discomfort
   hours (IDH) through input feature screening and hyperparameter
   optimization. Comparing optimization algorithms, Two-Archive
   Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimization
   (C-TAEA) demonstrates better convergence degree and optimization effect.
   Among the tested multi-criteria decision making methods, the VIKOR
   method selects the best building resilient design scheme from the Pareto
   data set, effectively reducing LCCE, LCC, and IDH, and leading to an
   overall improvement in building life cycle performance. Applying this
   framework, the finalized scheme for an office building in cold region
   optimizes 44.0\% of LCCE, 8.2\% of LCC, and 4.3\% of IDH. This framework
   develops a new approach to improve building life cycle performance under
   future climate uncertainty and supports informed decision-making for
   resilient building design. To promote carbon neutrality in construction,
   it is urged that future studies incorporate additional sources of
   uncertainty, such as occupant behavior, into the proposed framework.},

Title = {Implementation of a Life Cycle Cost Deep Learning Prediction Model Based
   on Building Structure Alternatives for Industrial Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Undoubtedly, most industrial buildings have a huge Life Cycle Cost (LCC)
   throughout their lifespan, and most of these costs occur in structural
   operation and maintenance costs, environmental impact costs, etc. Hence,
   it is necessary to think about a fast way to determine the LCC values.
   Therefore, this article presents an LCC deep learning prediction model
   to assess structural and envelope-type alternatives for industrial
   building, and to make a decision for the most suitable structure. The
   input and output criteria of the prediction model were collected from
   previous studies. The deep learning network model was developed using a
   Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) hidden
   layers. Seven investigation cases were studied to validate the
   prediction model of a 312-item dataset over a period of 30 years, after
   the training phase of the network to take the suitable hidden layers of
   the RBM and hidden neurons in each hidden layer that achieved the
   minimal errors of the model. Another case was studied in the model to
   compare design structure alternatives, consisting of three main
   structure frames-a reinforced concrete frame, a precast/pre-stressed
   concrete frame, and a steel frame-over their life cycle, and make a
   decision. Precast/pre-stressed concrete frames were the best decision
   until the end of the life cycle cost, as it is possible to reuse the
   removed sections in a new industrial building.},

Title = {Developing surrogate ANN for selecting near-optimal building energy
   renovation methods considering energy consumption, LCC and LCA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for more than 30\% of the total energy
   consumption and an equally large amount of related greenhouse gas
   emissions. Improving the energy performance of buildings is a critical
   element of building energy conservation. Furthermore, renovating
   existing buildings' envelopes and systems offers significant
   opportunities for reducing Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and minimizing negative
   environmental impacts. This approach can be considered as one of the key
   strategies for achieving sustainable development goals at a relatively
   low cost, especially when compared with the demolition and
   reconstruction of new buildings. One of the main methodological and
   technical issues of this approach is selecting a desirable renovation
   strategy among a wide range of available options.
   The main idea and motivation behind this study relies on trying to
   bridge the gap between Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization
   (SBMO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For a whole building
   simulation and optimization, current SBMOs often need thousands of
   simulation evaluations. Therefore, the optimization becomes unfeasible
   because of the computation time and complexity of the dependent
   parameters. To this end, one feasible technique to solve this problem is
   to implement surrogate models to computationally imitate expensive real
   building simulation models. The objective of the research focuses on
   developing a robust ANN to explore vast and complex data generated from
   the SBMO model. More specifically, this research aims to propose an
   accurate ANN to predict energy consumption using data from the SBMO
   model. The proposed model will potentially offer new venues to predict
   Total Energy Consumption (TEC), LCC, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for
   different renovation scenarios, and select the optimum scenario. To
   illustrate the applicability of the model, a case study was developed
   and the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated. Results show that
   models constructed using ANNs are considerably less time-consuming than
   the conventional Building Energy Model (BEM) while achieving acceptable
   accuracy.},

Abstract = {The Ratio of Exergy consumption to Energy consumption (REXE) of the
   building is defined in the paper. The building life cycle REXELC
   provides a full understanding of high-quality energy consumption during
   the building life cycle. It is proposed as a new thermodynamic parameter
   to evaluate the building life cycle energy efficiency. It also can be
   applied as a simplified way to calculate the building life cycle exergy
   consumption. Five public buildings in China are taken as the study
   cases. The energy consumption, exergy consumption, and cost per
   construction area of the five cases are calculated to study the
   parameter REXELC. It is concluded that the building life cycle REXELC
   mainly depends on the energy consumption proportion and REXE of the
   building material's production stage and building running stage. The
   economic analysis of the buildings shows that the building with too
   large or too small REXELC would not be the economic one. At last 2
   mathematical regression models are established to investigate the
   relation between building life cycle energy consumption and REXELC.
   According to the regression model, all the buildings can be divided into
   four zones. The REXELC would be an important instruction in optimizing
   the design of building envelope.},

Abstract = {Based on life cycle theory, this article divided life cycle energy into
   embodied energy and operating energy, then analyzed case data on 63
   buildings from 10 countries. First, this article applied linear
   regression analysis to build a linear model. High degree of coefficient
   of determination indicated high correlation existing between operating
   energy and life cycle energy. Further, the article employed one-sample
   t-test and compared the means of embodied energy in order to prove that
   low-energy buildings could reduce operating energy as well as embodied
   energy at present. At last, by one-way analysis of variance, this study
   showed the energy used in office buildings was much greater than that
   used in residential buildings. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Toward the application of a machine learning framework for building life
   cycle energy assessment},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {297},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The construction industry in the United States consumes more than 50\%
   of the global energy supply per year, suggesting that significant
   efforts may be needed to reduce building energy demand and its carbon
   footprint. During their lifespans, buildings consume embodied energy
   (EE) and operational energy (OE). Building professionals, therefore,
   conduct life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) to quantify and understand
   the paradox and interconnectedness between EE and OE. Traditionally,
   simulation-based optimization techniques were used for design space
   exploration to identify a building design with the fewest energy
   implications. However, literature shows these data-driven approaches are
   often error-prone, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, and
   they fail to provide real-time feedback to the user. Moreover, EE and OE
   assessment tools are disjointed and suffer from interoperability issues.
   These limitations restrict design space exploration, which eventually
   hinders the design decision-making process. Over the last few years, the
   increased availability of building data has made machine learning (ML)
   techniques a popular choice for building performance assessments.
   Several articles have developed prediction models to assess or optimize
   OE. While this work is significant, studies utilizing ML techniques for
   building LCEA are lacking, mainly due to the unavailability of a
   large-scale LCEA database. In this paper, we propose a methodology to
   (1) generate a simulation-based building energy dataset for different
   building typologies using a parametric framework, (2) utilize the
   synthetically generated database to develop an ML-based prediction model
   to predict EE and OE, and (3) test the model using a case study. The
   case study results show that the model achieves high prediction
   performance using minimal inputs available during the early design
   phase. The results further indicate that ML techniques can be used by
   building designers with no or limited LCE expertise to instantaneously
   estimate building LCE performance and help them select design options
   with minimal LCE consumption.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of commodity based big data platforms and an
   exponential increase in the research in machine learning techniques lead
   to a change in application development paradigm from traditional
   control-flow Software 1.0 to data-flow Software 2.0 programming paradigm
   e.g. use of machine learning based models over customer-scoring methods
   for generating recommendations. The Software 2.0 paradigm is a
   data-driven programming that requires specialized data management to get
   clean, governed and unbiased data sets, well defined neural network
   architectures for building a model, efficient model training, extensive
   testing and high performance deployment. Unlike Software 1.0 paradigm, a
   Software 2.0 program's output is probabilistic in nature as the
   correctness is highly dependent on the size and quality of the input
   data, however the program's performance is deterministic. This has led
   to the research in specialized hardware and high performance
   architectures for deep-learning algorithms. Also, the nature of Software
   2.0 paradigm brings in heterogeneity in the whole life cycle starting
   from an application development until its deployment in the production
   environment and hence posing numerous architecture and performance
   challenges.
   In this paper, we outline the research problems that will emerge due to
   migration of a part of Software 1.0 to Software 2.0. We present the
   challenges and the approaches to address them, for accelerating the
   development and deployment of Software 2.0 programs. We also envision
   evolution of existing enterprise IT systems to the data-driven
   enterprise IT systems, referred to as EIT 2.0. We have compared a
   conventional development life-cycle of applications with that in EIT
   2.0. We address research problems and approaches with the related
   state-of-art in the performance engineering of modern enterprise
   applications during its life cycle in EIT 2.0.},

Abstract = {As building automation becomes more prevalent, smart buildings will be
   integrated into smart cities. Using artificial intelligence (AI) is
   expected to increase efficiency and the automation level throughout the
   whole life cycle of building information modeling (BIM). Especially for
   the management phase of a building, facility managers are recognizing
   the value of machine learning and robotics for the automation of
   different maintenance tasks. In the fire safety management field,
   documentation of fire safety equipment (FSE) is required due to
   recurring maintenance work, system changes, and relocations. This study
   concentrates on the automatic detection of inspection tags on FSE using
   a YOLO network and its deployment on a mobile robot. The goal is to
   create a fully autonomous inspection mission for a legged robot by
   executing predefined routes, identifying FSE, and extracting necessary
   information, such as the next maintenance date tags.},

Title = {Machine learning and genetic algorithm-based framework for the
   life-cycle cost-based optimal design of self-centering building
   structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Self-centering systems have emerged as innovative lateral
   force-resisting mechanisms aimed at improving the earthquake resilience
   of building structures. The fully self-centering behavior effectively
   eliminates the residual deformation, thereby improving the
   post-earthquake repairability of building structures. However, this
   behavior does intensify floor acceleration responses that contribute to
   nonstructural damage and lead to increased initial costs. This research
   aims to develop a general machine learning and genetic algorithm-based
   framework for optimizing the design of self-centering building
   structures and to strike a balance between the initial costs and seismic
   losses by minimizing the overall life-cycle cost. The artificial neural
   network (ANN) based StructureNet model was developed for accelerating
   the calculation of life-cycle costs associated with self-centering
   structures. The genetic algorithm was adopted to determine the optimal
   design parameters for self-centering structures. The framework was
   applied to 8 design cases, with the analysis centering on two factors:
   the maximum allowable residual inter-story drift for controlling
   demolition and the initial construction cost of self-centering members.
   The study examined their influences on the optimization design results
   of self-centering building structures. The findings highlight a
   preference for a design approach that leans toward partially
   self-centering behavior as opposed to fully self-centering behavior,
   indicating the higher life-cycle benefits of partially selfcentering
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational
   contexts to provide personalized support to students and teachers. The
   unprecedented capacity of LLM-based applications to understand and
   generate natural language can potentially improve instructional
   effectiveness and learning outcomes, but the integration of LLMs in
   education technology has renewed concerns over algorithmic bias, which
   may exacerbate educational inequalities. Building on prior work that
   mapped the traditional machine learning life cycle, we provide a
   framework of the LLM life cycle from the initial development of LLMs to
   customizing pre-trained models for various applications in educational
   settings. We explain each step in the LLM life cycle and identify
   potential sources of bias that may arise in the context of education. We
   discuss why current measures of bias from traditional machine learning
   fail to transfer to LLM-generated text (eg, tutoring conversations)
   because text encodings are high-dimensional, there can be multiple
   correct responses, and tailoring responses may be pedagogically
   desirable rather than unfair. The proposed framework clarifies the
   complex nature of bias in LLM applications and provides practical
   guidance for their evaluation to promote educational equity.},

Title = {Rethinking system boundaries of the life cycle carbon emissions of
   buildings},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {90},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a strong consensus that carbon emissions attributed to
   buildings are a major contributor to global warming. Reducing buildings'
   carbon emissions becomes a matter of urgency and importance. However,
   despite the burgeoning body of knowledge of addressing buildings' carbon
   emissions in the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, the system
   boundaries of buildings' carbon emissions and actually of their relevant
   research had never been made explicit systemically. As a result, the
   definitions of buildings' life cycle differ considerably and the methods
   and models of analyzing buildings' life cycle carbon emissions (LCCa)
   vary; all these lead to discrepancies in reported buildings' LCCa and
   suggest a significant knowledge gap in effectively addressing the
   complex socio-technical features of buildings' LCCa. This paper aims to
   provide a fundamental rethink of the boundaries of buildings' LCCa for
   achieving meaningful benchmarking and learning in the future. The paper
   proposes a conceptual framework of system boundaries of buildings' LCCa,
   and develops a regression model to predict such LCCa with strategies for
   enhancing the validity and reliability of the prediction. The framework
   elaborates the boundaries of buildings' LCCa in the temporal, spatial,
   functional and methodological dimensions which together contain twelve
   variables, namely, life cycle stage, lifespan, climatic zone, geographic
   scope, LCA method, research method, unit of analysis, sources of
   emissions, building typology, level of prefabrication, building
   material, and density. The regression model is validated utilizing six
   representative cases of buildings' LCCa selected globally. Inconsistent
   system boundaries adopted were found to have contributed to the
   discrepancies between the resultant buildings' LCCa. The reconstructed
   system boundaries and developed regression model should facilitate a
   paradigmatic improvement in the body of knowledge of buildings' LCCa.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are
   increasingly used in many aspects of drug discovery. Larger data sizes
   and methods such as Deep Neural Networks contribute to challenges in
   data management, the required software stack, and computational
   infrastructure. There is an increasing need in drug discovery to
   continuously re-train models and make them available in production
   environments. Areas covered: This article describes how cloud computing
   can aid the ML life cycle in drug discovery. The authors discuss
   opportunities with containerization and scientific workflows and
   introduce the concept of MLOps and describe how it can facilitate
   reproducible and robust ML modeling in drug discovery organizations.
   They also discuss ML on private, sensitive and regulated data. Expert
   opinion: Cloud computing offers a compelling suite of building blocks to
   sustain the ML life cycle integrated in iterative drug discovery.
   Containerization and platforms such as Kubernetes together with
   scientific workflows can enable reproducible and resilient analysis
   pipelines, and the elasticity and flexibility of cloud infrastructures
   enables scalable and efficient access to compute resources. Drug
   discovery commonly involves working with sensitive or private data, and
   cloud computing and federated learning can contribute toward enabling
   collaborative drug discovery within and between organizations.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, machine learning (ML) has elicited increasing
   attention in building energy management (BEM) research. However, the
   boundary of the ML-BEM research has not been clearly defined, and no
   thorough review of ML applications in BEM during the whole building
   life-cycle has been published. This study aims to address this gap by
   reviewing the ML-BEM papers to ascertain the status of this research
   area and identify future research directions. An integrated framework of
   ML-BEM, composed of four layers and a series of driving factors, is
   proposed. Then, based on the hype cycle model, this paper analyzes the
   current development status of ML-BEM and tries to predict its future
   development trend. Finally, five research directions are discussed: (1)
   the behavioral impact on BEM, (2) the integration management of
   renewable energy, (3) security concerns of ML-BEM, (4) extension to
   other building life-cycle phases, and (5) the focus on fault detection
   and diagnosis. The findings of this study are believed to provide useful
   references for future research on ML-BEM.},

Pages = {87-94},
Abstract = {Life cycle cost analysis of maintenance costs and budgets for university
   buildings is essential. This paper briefly describes the meaning and
   application of the standard of maintenance costs and budgets, and
   addresses the meaning of maintenance cost and budgeting with regard to
   engineering. To examine this issue, a case study on the operations
   maintenance phase of four university buildings on the campus of National
   Taiwan University is presented. Using historical data on maintenance and
   repair over a 42-year period, a cost prediction model using the
   life-cycle cost (LCC) was determined using three different methods: (I)
   simple linear regression (SLR); (2) multiple regression (MR); and
   finally (3) a back propagation artificial neural network (BPN). The
   research results showed that the BPN model had good estimation ability.
   This paper implemented the BPN model in a case study to analyze the
   problems of maintenance costs and budgeting for university buildings.
   The study helps to set a legitimate standard for predicting repair
   maintenance costs, and proposes a plan and standard for the repair
   maintenance strategy of structures. The results of this study are
   provided to show how to establish a cost prediction model of maintenance
   and how these university buildings can be used to obtain the optimal
   life cycle maintenance scenario.},

Abstract = {The current work presents a Malaysian housing sector experience to
   develop an innovative prediction model for the operational carbon
   footprint at planning and design stage. Besides life-cycle assessment
   methodology, statistical technique of multiple regressions incorporated
   the effects of different identified variables. Three-dimensional
   parametric models of selected case studies were developed in a virtual
   environment using building information modeling (BIM). The emergence of
   multiple regressions, BIM and LCA, in an environmental assessment study
   for operational phase in a tropical region unlocked a new direction of
   research. The successful satisfaction and qualification of statistical
   criterion and tests ensured an efficient prediction model with an
   acceptable percentage error of +/- 6 between the predicted and observed
   values. The study aims to contribute to pre-assessments of CO2 levels at
   an early stage of life-cycle studies for quick sustainable decisions and

Abstract = {As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, the building
   sector is expected to consume even more energy and resources,
   exacerbating environmental damage. Life cycle Inventory Assessment is
   one of the main stages of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it is a
   methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts of buildings and
   other assets on the environment. We propose a literature review for
   examining the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the
   LCA of buildings. In particular, by incorporating AI into the process,
   it is checked that more accurate predictive modelling is enabled and the
   time needed for data gathering can be reduced. However, it is also noted
   that many challenges remain and must be still addressed, such as the
   need for standardized data and the risk of bias in AI algorithms.
   Despite these latter open challenges, it can be concluded that AI can
   significantly enhance sustainability in the building sector.Highlights

Abstract = {Buildings contribute to significant carbon dioxide emissions over their
   life cycle. The prefabrication approach has been promoted and
   increasingly integrated into building engineering and construction,
   which has attracted increasing research into the life-cycle carbon
   assessment (LCCA) of prefabricated buildings. However, there exist
   challenges. This paper examines the challenges and, through rethinking
   their theoretical fundamentals, proposes solutions with the aim to
   enhance the reliability and validity of research into the LCCA of
   prefabricated buildings. The challenges are found to be implicit system
   boundaries of prefabrication and LCCA: inconsistent methods, models and
   units of analysis of estimating buildings' life-cycle carbon dioxide
   emissions and LCCA being a labour-intensive process with limited
   accountability. The proposed solutions are a regression model of
   relating buildings' LCCA to 12 system boundaries, expressed by the
   system boundaries' inconsistency ratio (I-R), which shows the level of
   difference between any two system boundaries; a five-level framework of
   units of analysis consisting of material, component, assembly, flat and
   building; and a smart-technology-integrated approach for automatic LCCA.
   The solutions are important and timely to help reduce buildings'
   life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions effectively for achieving long-term
   sustainability of society.},

Abstract = {Purpose Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the process of systematically
   assessing impacts when there is an interaction between the environment
   and human activity. Machine learning (ML) with LCA methods can help
   contribute greatly to reducing impacts. The sheer number of input
   parameters and their uncertainties that contribute to the full life
   cycle make a broader application of ML complex and difficult to achieve.
   Hence a systems engineering approach should be taken to apply ML in
   isolation to aspects of the LCA. This study addresses the challenge of
   leveraging ML methods to deliver LCA solutions. The overarching
   hypothesis is that: LCA underpinned by ML methods and informed by
   dynamic data paves the way to more accurate LCA while supporting life
   cycle decision making. Methods In this study, previous research on ML
   for LCA were considered, and a literature review was undertaken. Results
   The results showed that ML can be a useful tool in certain aspects of
   the LCA. ML methods were shown to be applied efficiently in optimization
   scenarios in LCA. Finally, ML methods were integrated as part of
   existing inventory databases to streamline the LCA across many use
   cases. Conclusions The conclusions of this article summarise the
   characteristics of existing literature and provide suggestions for
   future work in limitations and gaps which were found in the literature.},

   uncertainty: Overview and state of the art},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {264},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment is necessary for evaluating the environmental
   impacts of buildings throughout their life cycle, considering factors
   such as energy consumption, emissions, and resource utilization.
   However, Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment introduces a temporal dimension,
   acknowledging that a building's environmental performance evolves due to
   technological advancements, occupancy behavior, and changing
   environmental conditions. This paper reviews DLCA, focusing on
   uncertainties arising from parameter, scenario, and model variability,
   and emphasizes the integration of technologies like Building Information
   Modeling, the Internet of Things, and machine learning to enhance
   real-time data collection and predictive analytics. An extensive review
   of 430 papers, refined to 180, reveals that 55 \% of publications are in
   environmental sciences, with significant contributions from the United
   Kingdom (27.8 \%), France (24.1 \%), and China (18.1 \%). Key findings
   include significant variations in embodied greenhouse gas emissions for
   materials like aluminum and the dynamic aspects of transportation
   impacts, which extend beyond traditional metrics to include operational
   efficiency over time. Uncertainties in all LCA stages (A1 to D) are
   addressed, focusing on service life, operational energy and water use,
   and transportation needs. Advanced methodologies, including a proposed
   framework for a hybrid LCA approach that integrates process-based and
   input-output methods, are suggested to enhance the comprehensiveness of
   assessments. The integration of real-time monitoring and predictive
   analytics further improves the adaptability and precision of LCA models,
   emphasizing the necessity of continuous updates and scenario analyses to
   capture future conditions accurately. This study paves the way for
   future research aimed at mitigating major sources of uncertainty,
   promoting more sustainable building practices, and advancing the field
   of dynamic LCA.},

Title = {Environmental benchmarking of building typologies through BIM-based
   combinatorial case studies},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {132},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools have emerged as
   decision-making support for BIM practitioners during the design stage of
   sustainable projects. However, differences between methodologies applied
   for determining the environmental impact of buildings produce
   significant variations in the results obtained, making them difficult to
   be compared. In this study, a methodology is defined for generating
   environmental benchmarks for building typologies through a combination
   of BIM-based LCA tools and machine learning techniques. When applied to
   an 11-story residential building typology with 92 dwellings by varying
   the constructive solutions of facades, partitions, roof and thermal
   insulation materials, results fall within a range from 360 to 430
   kgCO(2)eq/m(2). The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is successfully applied
   for identifying the most decisive variables in the analysis (partitions
   and facades), and shows signs of being useful for predicting the
   environmental impact of future constructions and to be applied to the
   analysis of greater scale urban zones.},

Title = {Predicting life cycle carbon emission of green office buildings via an
   integrated LCA- MLR framework},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {316},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Establishing predictive models for the embodied and operational carbons
   is vital to facilitate the quantification of the life cycle emissions of
   a green building. However, embodied carbon is often overlooked compared
   to the operational predictive model due to the complexity of collecting
   embodied data. Previous studies relied on basic parameters (i.e., GFA,
   storey, etc.) to quantify embodied carbon. This approach leads to
   uncertainty due to variations in building materials. Identifying
   material-specific parameters that contribute to the most embodied
   emissions is crucial to enhancing the prediction accuracy of regression
   models. Taking Malaysia `s green-certified office buildings as a case
   study, this study aims to develop an integrated Life Cycle
   Assessment-Multiple Linear Regression (LCA-MLR) framework to establish
   hotspot-oriented regression models. Results show that cement and steel
   contribute two-thirds of embodied emissions and are adopted in the MLR
   model to predict embodied carbon. Hotspot-based embodied regression
   equations, formulated using material-specific parameters, enable
   accurate prediction with 23.7 -42.1\% variation compared to actual
   embodied emissions, while gross floor area and storey incur 90.6 -93.4\%
   and 99.7 -99.9\% variation, respectively. Using the hotspot-oriented
   regression models, a new Green Office Building Carbon Rating is
   established to benchmark the carbon performance of newly green buildings
   with the other existing green office buildings in Malaysia.},

Title = {The application of life cycle assessment in buildings: challenges, and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},

Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {627-654},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research
   trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research.
   Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current
   research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review
   methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research
   publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and
   retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA
   applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research.
   Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified,
   which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and
   discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively
   control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such
   mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new
   generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and
   continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective
   operation and management strategies of buildings and districts.
   Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system
   modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant
   emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently
   missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life
   cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent
   characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA
   results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept
   of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and
   spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and
   thus more effectively promotes a ``cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation{''}
   environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to
   leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic
   models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable
   environmental assessments.},

Title = {Enhancing the Practicality of Tools to Estimate the Whole Life Embodied
   Carbon of Building Structures <i>via</i> Machine Learning Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The construction and operation of buildings account for significant
   environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy
   demand, resource consumption and waste generation. While the operation
   of buildings is fairly well regulated and globally considered in the
   pathways to net-zero mid-century targets, a different picture emerges
   when looking at the other life cycle stages, which incur the so-called
   embodied impacts. These cover raw material extraction and product
   manufacturing through to construction and end of life activities. Only a
   handful of examples exist where such embodied carbon (EC) emissions are
   enshrined in law with most of the ongoing debate still around estimating
   and understanding where such emissions occur and how to mitigate them.
   Building structures account for a significant share of a building's
   embodied emissions and they also are the building element with the
   longest service life, thus presenting potential lock-in challenges for
   choices made today. To support the ongoing global effort to mitigate
   embodied carbon and equip engineers and designers worldwide with
   easy-to-use and robust calculation tools, we describe a real-time
   decision-support tool to aid building design that leverages machine
   learning (ML) methods from computer science to speed-up the
   computationally expensive process of finite element analysis (FEA)
   traditionally exploited in structural engineering. We demonstrate that
   replacing FEA calculations with a model learnt using ML from a large
   dataset offers real time decision support while guaranteeing the same
   level of confidence and accuracy that a traditional FEA-based method
   would offer at the design stage. The tool has been developed both as a
   standalone version and as a plugin for Trimble SketchUp to maximise its
   usability and diffusion. It offers results correlated with uncertainty
   analysis in the form of probability density functions to account for the
   inherent variability of input data that characterises early stages in
   the design process. This research contributes to the ongoing global
   efforts to decarbonising the built environment and offers an immediately
   implementable method and tool for doing so.</p>},

Title = {Multi-objective optimization designs of phase change material-enhanced
   building using the integration of the Stacking model and NSGA-III
   algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The incorporation of phase change materials (PCM) into building
   envelopes has proven to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption
   to combat climate change. However, the energy performance of
   PCM-enhanced building depends on several factors and the optimization of
   such factors using empirical building design is more difficult and
   sometimes even impossible. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   multi-objective optimization method to consider multi-objectives,
   including building energy consumption, economic benefit, and
   carbon-saving. In this study, a non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
   III (NSGA III) is coupled with a Stacking model to minimize building
   operational energy consumption (BOEC) and maximize life cycle economic
   benefit (LCEB) and life cycle carbon reduction (LCCR) simultaneously by
   finding the optimum configuration of PCM thickness, window-to-wall
   ratio, exterior glazing U-value and solar heat gain coefficient. The
   results show that the Stacking model combined with 8 heterogeneous
   machine learning models has the best performance for predicting energy
   consumption with a high correlation efficiency (R-2 = 0.97). In
   addition, the building optimized with the Stacking-NSGA III framework
   shows a reduction of BOEC by 45.38 \% and an increase of LCCR by 10.75
   kg.CO2.e/m(2). Moreover, the LCEB over a 50-year service life is 452.21
   CNY/m(2). It is believed that the proposed multi-objective optimization
   method can help stakeholders to find the most suitable PCM-building
   design strategies for their specific needs.},

Title = {A data-driven framework for designing a renewable energy community based
   on the integration of machine learning model with life cycle assessment
   and life cycle cost parameters},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This research paper presents a data-driven framework for design
   optimization of renewable energy communities (RECs) in the residential
   sector, considering both techno-economic challenges and environmental
   impact. The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for
   photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy
   systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To
   achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro
   and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that
   integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life
   cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a
   multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC
   and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a
   multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model
   (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection
   criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario
   optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the
   effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of
   REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for
   the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona,
   Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial
   improvement in economic , environmental benefits for designing REC, the
   optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE =
   0.044 \$/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction
   of 85.04\% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE =
   0.220 \$/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in
   environmental impact of 54.59\% compared to the base case. Overall, the
   developed data -driven provides policy decision -making with an
   evaluation of REC in the residential sector.},

Title = {Measuring Carbon in Cities and Their Buildings through Reverse
   Engineering of Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {According to the European Green Deal, excessive carbon emissions are the
   origin of global warming and must be drastically reduced. Given that the
   building sector is one of the major sources of carbon emissions, results
   imperative to limit these emissions, especially in a city context where
   the density of buildings is commonly higher and rapidly increasing. All
   stages of the life cycle of a building, including raw material
   harvesting, manufacturing of products, use phase of the building, end of
   life, all generate or reduce carbon. The manufacture of construction
   materials accounts for 11\% of all energy and process-related emissions
   annually. Additionally, recent estimates indicate that over 80\% of all
   product-related environmental impacts of a building are determined
   during the design phase of the building. These indicators reflect the
   urgent need to explore a low-carbon measure method for building design.
   This is here done using a linear regression Reverse Engineering model
   and percentage calculation. One of the hypotheses formulated relates
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) of -30.000 CO2eq or lower (around -165
   CO2eq/m2) in the 25\% of a block of houses, to carbon further reductions
   by 11\%. This paper has identified barriers in terms of the databases
   needed to achieve this task.},

   Xi'an City during the Scheme Design Stage},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The effect of energy saving and carbon reduction in the building
   industry is closely related to the realization of China's double carbon
   goal. In this study, a two-dimensional framework for building life cycle
   carbon emissions was established, which takes into account the early
   stages of building design such as the feasibility study stage and scheme
   design stage. Taking 57 residential buildings in Xi'an City as examples,
   the life cycle carbon emission characteristics of residential buildings
   in cold areas were introduced. This study found that the life cycle
   carbon emission intensity is about 45 similar to 55 kgCO(2)/(m(2)center
   dot a). The operation and maintenance stage and building materials
   production stage accounted for the largest proportion of carbon
   emissions, and the sum of carbon emissions of the two stages accounted
   for 92.3\% of the total carbon emissions. In addition, based on the
   probability density function, the carbon emission intensity
   distributions of the building life cycle, building material production
   stage, building material transportation stage, and operation and
   maintenance stage were analyzed, and it was found that each distribution
   fitting graph was generally in line with a lognormal distribution, and
   their expected value provided a reference index for carbon emission
   pre-assessment in the feasibility study stage. Based on the analysis and
   determination of 11 independent variables that affect the total carbon
   emissions, such as area, floor number, story height, and number of
   households, a multiple linear regression model for carbon emission
   pre-assessment in the design stage of building schemes is proposed. The
   R-adj(2) of the model is 0.985 and the error is about 10\%. The
   prediction model can provide beneficial guidance for the life cycle
   carbon emission prediction in the design stage of building projects, so
   as to reduce carbon emissions by changing building design.},

Title = {Early design phase energy predictions using a semi-dynamic approach as
   an accurate proxy for dynamic energy simulations},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The building sector is well known as one of the significant contributors
   to climate change. The use of materials and energy are important
   drivers, both during construction and the whole life cycle. This study
   is part of a research to improve the Belgian national approach of life
   cycle environmental assessment for buildings. The current approach
   focusses mainly on material use, and the operational energy is estimated
   via the equivalent degree day method assuming a fixed value of 1200
   equivalent heating degree days per year. This paper extends this
   widespread degree day approach to improve its accuracy by including the
   effect of various parameters (climate, building characteristics,
   obstructions by the environment, occupant behaviour). Step by step
   user-friendly input and graphical feedback is moreover considered
   necessary for designers and has been added. The annual heating energy
   estimated by our proposed semi -dynamic model has been validated by
   dynamic energy simulations using EnergyPlus of 8000 randomly generated
   cases. Both results have been plotted in a 2D graph. The slope of the
   linear regression through the origin is 0.8955, and the R -square value
   is 0.9058. Based on this comparison, it is concluded that the
   semidynamic model, with simplified input and fast results, has
   sufficient accuracy for the first design phases compared to the dynamic
   model. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing environmental performance in early building design stage: An
   integrated parametric design and machine learning method},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Decisions made at early design stage have major impacts on buildings'
   life-cycle environmental performance. However, when only a few
   parameters are determined in early design stages, the detailed design
   decisions may still vary significantly. This may cause same early design
   to have quite different environmental impacts. Moreover, default
   settings for unknown detailed design parameters clearly cannot cover all
   possible variations in impact, and Monte Carlo analysis is sometimes not
   applicable as parameters' probability distributions are usually unknown.
   Thus, uncertainties about detailed design make it difficult for existing
   environmental assessment methods to support early design decisions.
   Thus, this study developed a quantitative method using parametric design
   technology and machine learning algorithms for assessing buildings'
   environmental performance in early decision stages, considering
   uncertainty associated with detailed design decisions. The parametric
   design technology creates design scenarios dataset, then associated
   environmental performances are assessed using environmental assessment
   databases and building performance simulations. Based on the generated
   samples, a machine learning algorithm integrating fuzzy C-means
   clustering and extreme learning machine extracts the case-specific
   knowledge regarding designed buildings' early design associated with
   environmental uncertainty. Proposed method is an alternative but more
   generally applicable method to previous approaches to assess building's
   environmental uncertainty in early design stages.},

Title = {Evaluating Life-Cycle Energy Costs of Heritage Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {After the sustainability of heritage buildings (HBs) has been evaluated
   and it is determined that rehabilitation is needed, then the life-cycle
   cost (LCC) of energy for HBs can be analyzed. The objective of this
   research was to evaluate the LCC of energy for HBs and develop a
   comprehensive life-cycle model that will aid in expenditure planning and
   budget allocation. This study was validated through the weighted sums
   method and two case studies-Murabba Palace (MP), Saudi Arabia; and Grey
   Nuns Building (GN), Canada-were evaluated. For any HB, the project life
   cycle includes planning, manufacturing, transportation, construction,
   operation, and maintenance phases. Saudi Arabian and Canadian experts
   completed questionnaires to attribute a percentage of importance of each
   of the aforementioned phases with respect to energy consumption. The
   findings from this study will enable facility managers to make effective
   rehabilitation decisions. The operation phase has the highest impact on
   the energy consumption, gas consumption, and cost of the building in
   both case studies. Moreover, the findings from this study can be used to
   establish cost-effective intervention strategies. Their responses were
   employed in the development of a life-cycle model. Excel (R) and Minitab
   (R) were used to calculate Cronbach's alpha values for data reliability,
   and the project LCC of energy for the two case studies was studied. The
   operation phase appeared to be the most energy-consuming phase in both
   case studies, contributing the most to the cost of the building.},

Abstract = {With the rising adoption of Building Information Model (BIM) for asset
   management within architecture, engineering, construction and
   owner-operated (AECO) sector, BIM-enabled asset management has been
   increasingly attracting more attentions in both research and practice.
   This study provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the
   state-of-the-art latest research and industry standards development that
   impact upon BIM and asset management within the operations and
   maintenance (O\&M) phase. However, BIM is not always enough in
   whole-life cycle asset management, especially in the O\&M phase.
   Therefore, a framework for future development of smart asset management
   is proposed, integrating the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT integrates
   artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create
   dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of
   the physical counterpart from multiple sources. The findings will
   contribute to inspiring novel research ideas and promote widespread
   adoption of smart DT-enabled asset management within the O\&M phase.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {818-834},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to identify the main non-cost factors
   affecting accurate estimation of life cycle cost (LCC) in building
   projects.
   Design/methodology/approach - Ten factors affecting LCC in building
   project cost estimates are identified through literature and interviews.
   A questionnaire survey is conducted to rank these factors in order of
   priority and provide the views of cost practitioners about the
   significance of these factors in the accurate estimation of LCC. The
   data from 138 construction building projects completed in UK were
   collected and analysed via multiple regression to discover the
   relationship between capital and LCCs and between non-cost factors and
   cost estimation at each stage of the life cycle (capital, operation,
   maintenance and LCC).
   Findings - The results of analysis of existing LCC data of completing
   project and survey data from cost professionals are mostly consistent
   with many literature views and provide a reasonable description of the
   non-cost factors affecting the accuracy of estimates.
   Originality/value - The value of this study is in the method used, which
   involves analysis of existing life data and survey data from cost
   professionals. The results provide a plausible description of the
   non-cost factors affecting the accuracy of estimates.},

Title = {State-of-the-art on research and applications of machine learning in the
   building life cycle},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {212},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Fueled by big data, powerful and affordable computing resources, and
   advanced algorithms, machine learning has been explored and applied to
   buildings research for the past decades and has demonstrated its
   potential to enhance building performance. This study systematically
   surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of
   building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of
   Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153
   papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is
   increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and
   control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building
   commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and
   diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy
   baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and
   learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the
   existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to
   common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to
   train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which
   limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another
   building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs
   and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance
   might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method
   might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others.
   Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to
   improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and
   resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the
   field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building
   science, computing science, data science, and social science. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Sustainable comfortable living requires comprehensive energy consumption
   planning for the housing habitat. Besides other energy planning
   considerations, the variations in physical features of built facilities,
   their environmental interaction, and resulting operational life cycle
   carbon footprint are an important focus in contemporary research.
   Therefore, this research aims to explore the relationship between the
   physical features of the built facility and the resulting carbon
   footprint for conventional housing designs. A combination of
   conventional Malaysian model housing units was developed in 3D virtual
   prototypes by building information modeling, and regression analysis was
   used to investigate the environmental impact paradigm of the built
   facility. Correspondingly, an operational CO2 pre-assessment was also
   examined by the partial life cycle assessment technique during the early
   stages of design and planning. The results of this study show a positive
   and statistically significant linear relation of carbon footprint with
   the area, volume, and power rating parameters. The outcome of this study
   is imperative for designing resource-efficient living facilities and
   achieving a sustainable built environment through a proactive life cycle
   assessment of housing construction projects.},

Title = {Dynamically assessing life cycle energy consumption of buildings at a
   national scale by 2020: An empirical study in China},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {296},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization and rising living standards in China have
   significantly increased building energy consumption, creating
   environmental pressures that necessitate the implementation of effective
   long-term energy-saving policies and plans. High-quality energy
   assessment plays a crucial role in developing these strategies. However,
   accurately assessing energy consumption on a national scale can be
   challenging due to the complex nature of energy systems and numerous
   potential influencing factors. This study aims to explore the internal
   interaction mechanism among energy-related factors from a macro
   perspective to improve the accuracy of energy consumption assessment. A
   national-level Integrated Dynamic Energy Assessment (IDEA) model is
   developed to reveal the potential linear and non-linear relationships in
   the macro energy system through system dynamics and the least squares
   method, and meanwhile to quantify the life cycle energy consumption of
   urban residential buildings in China from 2000 to 2020 accordingly.
   Results show 1) the five energy-related subsystems (population, economy,
   building, energy, and environment) achieved significant growth at least
   twice. 2) there are strong connections among them, as evidenced by
   multivariate linear and non-linear regression equations; 3) life cycle
   energy consumption of buildings has increased significantly over the
   last 20 years from 192.86 M tce to 1131.07 M tee, and the largest
   contributor is operational energy (45\%), followed by embodied energy
   (33\%) and mobile energy (22\%) in 2020. 4) The discrepancies in
   end-uses of the operational energy indicate marked changes in occupants'
   energy-use behaviours in recent years. This study provides not only a
   more precise interactive system for evaluating national-level energy
   consumption, but also detailed life cycle energy consumption and
   internal interconnection relationships that can assist China's energy
   policymaking and serve as a reference for other nations.},

Title = {Machine learning for performance prediction in smart buildings:
   Photovoltaic self-consumption and life cycle cost optimization},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {334},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The application of Photovoltaic (PV) system in buildings is growing
   rapidly in response to the need for clean energy sources and building
   decarbonization targets. Nonetheless, enhancing PV self-consumption
   through technical solutions such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is
   getting higher importance to increase the profitability of PV plants, by
   minimizing the building-grid interaction. In this context, analyzing PV
   self-consumption of different energy storage configurations becomes more
   relevant and crucial in building energy modeling although it is heavily
   time-consuming and complicated, particularly within a multi-objective
   optimization related to the ESS design. As a solution to resolve this
   issue, this paper evaluates the accuracy, training, and prediction speed
   of 24 Machine Learning (ML) models to be used as surrogate models for
   analyzing PV self-consumption in smart buildings. Furthermore, the
   performance of short-term Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to increase PV
   self -consumption is assessed and presented using ML models. The results
   showed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Networks (NN)
   including bilayered and trilayered NN models, Support Vector Machines
   (SVM) including the fine gaussian and cubic SVM models, and Ensembles of
   Trees (EoT) as superior ML models. The results also revealed that TES
   systems can efficiently increase PV self-consumption in the building
   equipped with electric heat pumps to provide heating, cooling, and
   domestic hot water. Moreover, the TES size optimization regarding the
   Life Cycle Cost (LCC) showed that the LCC-based optimum TES size can
   yield 7.1\% savings within 30 years of the building service life. The
   novelties of this research are first to provide a reference to select
   the most suitable ML models in predicting PV self-consumption, second to
   implement machine learning for analyzing the performance of short-term
   thermal energy storage to enhance PV self-consumption in buildings, and
   third to carry out an LCC-based optimization on TES size using ML-based
   prediction models.},

Title = {Quantitative approaches in life cycle assessment-part 2-multivariate

Abstract = {This study examines the use of inferential statistics, specifically
   multivariate correlation and regression, as a means of interpreting LCA
   data. It is believed that these methods provide additional context in
   understanding data and results, and may serve as a way to present the
   uncertain results that are inherent to LCA.
   Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five
   service life models (N = 45). Three environmental indicators were used:
   global warming potential, atmospheric ecotoxicity, and atmospheric
   acidification from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical
   and Other Environmental Impacts assessment method. Multivariate
   correlation was performed using nine variables, including cumulative
   life cycle impact, major replacement, major replacement (frequency),
   minor replacement, major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2,
   and total transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). The same data set
   was used for the regression analysis, although the variables were
   limited to major replacement, minor replacement, major repair, and minor
   repair (N = 45, 225 data points). SPSS software was used for all
   statistical calculations.
   Multivariate correlation analysis showed strong, statistically
   significant correlations between cumulative life cycle impact and major
   replacement across all environmental indicators. Similarly, the
   regression analysis showed strong R (2) values between cumulative life
   cycle impact and major replacement, such that the influence of all other
   variables was considerably diminished.
   The use of inferential statistics provides useful information with
   respect to the strength and statistical significance of correlations
   between variables as in multivariate correlation, and allows for
   predictive capacity of impact, as demonstrated through regression
   analysis. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the added value
   of these analytical tools.},

Title = {Bayesian optimization plus XGBoost based life cycle carbon emission
   prediction for residential buildings-An example from Chengdu, China},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},

Abstract = {The large amount of carbon emissions generated by buildings during their
   life cycle greatly impacts the environment and poses a considerable
   challenge to China's carbon reduction efforts. The building design phase
   has the most significant potential to reduce building life-cycle carbon
   emissions (LCCO2). However, the lack of detailed inventory data at the
   design stage makes calculating a building's LCCO2 very difficult and
   complex. Therefore, accurate prediction of building LCCO2 at the design
   stage using relevant design factors is essential to reduce carbon
   emissions. This paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm combining
   Bayesian optimization and extreme gradient boosting (BO-XGBoost) to
   predict LCCO2 accurately in residential buildings. First, this study
   collected and calculated the LCCO2 of 121 residential buildings in
   Chengdu, China. Second, a carbon emission prediction model was developed
   using XGBoost based on 15 design factors, and hyperparameter
   optimization was performed using the BO algorithm. Finally, the model
   performance was evaluated using two evaluation metrics, coefficient of
   determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE), and the
   prediction performance of other models was compared with that of the
   BO-XGBoost model. The results show that the RMSE of the proposed
   BO-XGBoost for predicting LCCO2 in residential buildings is at least
   40\% lower compared to other models. The method adopted in this study
   can help designers accurately predict building LCCO2 at the early design
   stage and provide methodological support for similar studies in the
   future.},

Title = {Sensitivity analysis of design variables in life-cycle environmental
   impacts of buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large portion of global energy
   consumption and carbon emissions. Improvements in building design
   contribute to reducing environmental impacts of buildings. In this
   context, a crucial issue is to understand which design variables should
   be considered while which variables could be negligible. The objective
   of this study is to develop a framework for as-sessing the influence of
   various design variables throughout the design process in the
   environ-mental impacts of a building over its life cycle. This
   methodological framework combined build-ing information modelling and
   life cycle assessment tools and a global sensitivity analysis using the
   Morris elementary effects method. A residential building was applied to
   demonstrate the de-veloped framework. The influence of six design
   variables in early design stages (including, floor area, aspect ratio,
   floor height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio and number of floors),
   nine variables in detailed design stages (including, structure type of
   external and internal walls, type of insulation material for external
   and internal walls, insulation material for floors, waterproof-ing and
   insulation material for roof, type of window frame, and glazing type),
   and four variables in construction design stages (including, type of
   finishing for external walls, internal walls and floors, and roof tiles)
   are examined. Three environmental impact criteria (including, embodied,
   operational, and life-cycle environmental impacts) of a building are
   considered. The results iden-tified the most influential variables
   throughout the design process, highlighting aspect ratio in early design
   stage, the structure and insulation materials for walls in detailed
   design stages, and the roof title in construction design stages. The
   outcomes of this research can assist in under-standing the importance of
   design variables in each design stage throughout the design process of a
   building.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study performed design optimization on a building with integrated
   photovoltaic, Trombe wall and phase change material based on building
   life cycle cost (LCC) and indoor thermal comfort. A total of thirty-four
   design variables were considered as the optimization variables. The
   optimization process consists of four steps. Firstly, Monte Carlo Method
   was used to generate a set of design samples, and the LCC and indoor
   discomfort degree hour were obtained through computer simulation.
   Secondly, stepwise linear regression (SLR) and artificial neural network
   (ANN) models were developed as the prediction models. ANN models
   exhibited better prediction performance with errors of less than 6\%.
   Thirdly, six optimization algorithms were selected to couple with the
   ANN models for design optimization and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary
   Algorithm II (SPEA II) presented the best performance. Finally,
   optimization with different groups of design variables were conducted by
   using the SPEA II algorithm. Compared with the reference building, the
   optimal solutions reduce life cycle cost up to 45.51\% and improve
   thermal comfort level up to 43.81\%. The recommended heating and cooling
   temperature setpoint is around 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C,
   respectively. The PCM type convergence value is BioPCM M182/Q21, and the
   east and west window-to-wall ratios are around 10\%.},

Title = {Machine learning algorithms for energy efficiency: Mitigating carbon
   dioxide emissions and optimizing costs in a hospital infrastructure},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {318},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings incur significant energy consumption due to their
   expensive operations, advanced medical equipment, strict sanitation
   protocols, and compliance with environmental standards in various
   weather conditions. For this study, focusing on two distinct climate
   regions in Turkey-Aksaray and Bursa provinces-a total of 1,440 unique
   scenarios were generated. These scenarios utilized materials from the
   Revit Building Information Modeling (BIM) software library,
   incorporating variations in thermal transmittance coefficients, solar
   heat gain coefficients, and building orientation angles. The research
   employed machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption,
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, total expenditures, and life cycle
   costs. While the Revit BIM software library provides numerous
   combinations of building materials, it's important to note that only a
   limited subset undergoes practical testing during construction. The main
   objective is to streamline the estimation of energy consumption, CO2
   emissions, overall costs, and life cycle expenditures in similar
   architectural settings and under comparable climate conditions,
   eliminating the need for drafting and energy calculation software.
   Across all machine learning algorithms, predictions generated by
   artificial neural networks closely aligned with actual values. Notably,
   the R-squared (R2) values, a critical evaluation metric, produced the
   following outcomes: both R2 values for energy were 0.95; total costs
   achieved 0.93 and 0.97; CO2 emissions attained 0.94 and 0.97; and life
   cycle costs garnered 0.95 and 0.94 for validation and test datasets,
   respectively. These results suggest that the successes observed in the
   two provinces can be extrapolated to data from all regions in Turkey.
   Moreover, our model is capable of predicting energy consumption, costs,
   and CO2 emissions based on thermal transmittance values complying with
   the Turkish standard TS 825 and building orientation angles.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building maintenance and operation costs represent a significant portion
   of the life cycle costs (LCC) of construction projects. The accurate
   estimation of these costs is essential for ensuring the long-term
   sustainability and financial efficiency of buildings. This study aims to
   develop a novel framework for predicting maintenance and operation costs
   in construction projects by integrating an emotional artificial neural
   network (EANN). Unlike traditional models that rely on linear regression
   or static machine learning, the EANN dynamically adapts its learning
   through synthetic emotional feedback mechanisms and advanced
   optimization techniques. The research collected input data from 313
   experts in the field of building management and construction in Ha'il,
   Saudi Arabia, through a comprehensive questionnaire. The integration of
   expert opinions with advanced machine learning techniques contributes to
   the innovative approach, providing more reliable and adaptive cost
   predictions. The proposed EANN model was then compared with a classic
   artificial neural network (ANN) model to evaluate its performance. The
   results indicate that the EANN model achieved an R2 value of 0.85 in
   training and 0.81 in testing for buildings aged 0 to 10 years,
   significantly outperforming the ANN model, which achieved R2 values of
   0.78 and 0.72, respectively. Additionally, the Root Mean Squared Error
   (RMSE) for the EANN model was 1.57 in training and 1.60 in testing,
   lower than the ANN's RMSE values of 1.82 and 1.90. These findings show
   that the superior capability of the EANN model in estimating maintenance
   and operation costs.. This led to more accurate long-term maintenance
   cost projections, reduced budgeting uncertainty, and enhanced
   decision-making reliability for building managers.},

Abstract = {As an effective strategy for improving the productivity of the
   construction industry, prefabricated construction has attracted concerns
   worldwide. This study investigated the life-cycle energy use of
   prefabricated components and the corresponding effect on the total
   embodied energy use for a number of real building projects. Result
   showed that the life-cycle energy use of prefabricated components ranged
   from 7.33 GJ/m(3) for precast staircase to 13.34 GJ/m(3) for precast
   form. The recycling process could achieve 16\%-24\% energy reduction.
   This study also found that apart from reusability, energy savings are
   also obtained from waste reduction and high quality control, saving
   4\%-14\% of the total life-cycle energy consumption. All these
   advantages can be regarded as important environment friendly strategies
   provided by precast construction. The linear regression analysis
   indicated that the average increment in energy use was nearly linearly
   correlated with prefabrication rate. Precast facade and form are
   identified as energy-intensive components compared with the conventional
   construction method. Therefore, the challenge lies in improving the
   integrality and quality of the prefabrication technique while reducing
   its dependence on energy-intensive materials. Besides, attention should
   be focused on improving the maturity of the precast market to avoid
   additional energy consumption during prophase investigation. (C) 2015

Title = {Evaluating the impact of operating energy reduction measures on embodied
   energy},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {226},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Annually, 48\% of the global energy is used by buildings in their
   construction, operation, and maintenance, causing significant damage to
   the environment due to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. During
   their life cycles, buildings use energy in the form of embodied energy
   (EE) and operating energy (OE). In a conventional building, EE accounts
   for 10-20\% of a building's life cycle energy (LCE), while OE accounts
   for 80-90\%. As a result, the building sector has taken several measures
   to reduce OE in buildings. These OE reducing measures fail to account
   for the subsequent increase in EE and might cause an increase in the
   building's overall LCE. A systematic review of the literature shows
   limited research that comprehensively evaluates the impact of design
   measures aimed at OE reduction on EE for different construction
   assemblies. In this study, we quantify and compare trade-offs on EE
   demand, caused by OE reduction measures for eight different building
   wall assemblies across four climatic zones within the United States. The
   EE and OE demands of the ASHRAE 90.1-2016 benchmark model and its
   variations were computed using Tally (TM) and Autodesk (R) Green
   Building Studio (R) (GBS), respectively. The results helped us determine
   the EE factor (EE spent per unit of OE savings) for different OE
   reduction measures. Although the calculated EE factors vary across
   different climatic zones and construction assemblies, these factors show
   significant EE costs for different OE reduction measures. This knowledge
   could help inform the design of evolutionary and deep/machine
   learning-based algorithms to assess and optimize building energy use.

   We also propose the methodology for using the benefits of decomposition
   and proposed approach to analyze the events occurring during the
   production process using machine learning. The brief review of methods
   of calculation of depreciation of construction objects is presented. The
   choice of task examination of technical condition of a building or

   analysis of geometrical parameters, instrumental studies, the
   determination of the actual characteristics of materials of the basic
   bearing structures and their elements, the measurement of the
   operational environment and operating loads, etc. Considered the models
   implementing machine learning for the classification of life cycle
   events. Descriptors of the internal production network data were used
   for training and testing of applied models. k-Nearest Neighbors and
   Random forest methods were used to illustrate and analyze proposed

Abstract = {A novel embodied carbon prediction tool has been developed for
   conventionally constructed housing units. Single and double storey
   terraced, semi-detached and detached housing projects were evaluated by
   adoption of partial life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. The
   statistical technique of multivariable regression analysis was merged
   with LCA and building information modeling (BIM) for prediction of such
   environmental issue in housing sector. The assessment was limited to
   pre-use phase with LCA boundary of ``cradle to site{''}. The criteria
   and requirements for a statistically consistent and efficient prediction
   tool were successfully satisfied with an acceptable average prediction
   error of less than 5\%. Based on very basic explanatory variables, the
   tool also helped to manage the barrier of huge data requirements for
   such environmental studies. The study is expected to act as a milestone
   and help the researchers and industry professionals for quick, effective
   and sustainable environmental assessment, decision making and solutions.

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The reduction of energy usage and environmental impact of the built
   environment and construction industry is crucial for sustainability on a
   global scale. We are working towards an increased commitment towards
   resource efficiency in the built environment and to the growth of
   innovative businesses following circular economy principles. The
   conceptualization of change is a relevant part of energy and
   sustainability transitions research, which is aimed at enabling radical
   shifts compatible with societal functions. In this framework, building
   performance has to be considered in a whole life cycle perspective
   because buildings are long-term assets. In a life cycle perspective,
   both operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions have to be
   considered for appropriate comparability and decision-making. The
   application of sustainability assessments of products and practices in
   the built environment is itself a critical and debatable issue. For this
   reason, the way energy consumption data are measured, processed, and
   reported has to be progressively standardized in order to enable
   transparency and consistency of methods at multiple scales (from single
   buildings up to building stock) and levels of analysis (from individual
   components up to systems), ideally complementing ongoing research
   initiatives that use open science principles in energy research. In this
   paper, we analyse the topic of linking design and operation phase's
   energy performance analysis through regression-based approaches in
   buildings, highlighting the hierarchical nature of building energy
   modelling data. The goal of this research is to review the current state
   of the art of in order to orient future efforts towards integrated data
   analysis workflows, from design to operation. In this sense, we show how
   data analysis techniques can be used to evaluate the impact of both
   technical and human factors. Finally, we indicate how approximated
   physical interpretation of regression models can help in developing
   data-driven models that could enhance the possibility of learning from
   feedback and reconstructing building stock data at multiple levels.},

Title = {Energy simulation and modeling for window system: A comparative study of
   life cycle assessment and life cycle costing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {330},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The impact of the window system on building thermal performance is
   considerably complicated. It depends upon several interactive design
   factors and climatic diversity. Unfortunately, there is a lack of
   comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) involving operational thermal
   efficiency with embodied production. Yet upgrading the thermal
   efficiency of windows and cost of energy savings should be justified
   from the additional investment cost. Therefore, the study presents a
   holistic approach for optimizing the windows system integrating
   operational efficiency with comprehensive LCA and life cycle costing
   (LCC). The study employed energy simulation software FirstRate5 over a
   range of energy-efficient windows to assess potential design variables
   for energy expenditure. Performed simulations illustrate the dominance
   of facade insulation (R) above glazing in reducing energy consumption,
   roughly 87\% of the cumulative reduction. However, the provision of a
   zero window is not an optimum solution for permitting daylight and fresh
   air. Thus, an analytical framework has been proposed for glazing to
   ensure thermal efficiency, lower embodied impacts, and
   cost-effectiveness. The resulting Pearson coefficient (r) shows a
   relatively higher thermal conductivity (Uw = 0.39) correlation with
   energy consumptions in a colder climate than hot- and warm-temperate
   environments. Thousands of simulations have been performed to generate
   data for developing linear regression models. In addition, Monte Carlo
   simulations have been conducted to validate the uncertainties of
   developed models. LCC analysis specifies the provision of glazing
   40-68\% of the window to wall ratio (WWR) feasible for optimal
   trade-offs. BIM-enabled LCA (Tally) identifies embodied environmental
   impacts for Aluminium, Timber, Fiberglass, uPVC, and Composite frame
   windows following the ISO 14040-14044 standards. Comparative analysis of
   different framed windows shows the suitability of using uPVC windows
   over others due to less cost, thermal efficiency, fewer environmental
   impacts, recycling possessions, and less energy demand at the
   manufacturing stage.},

   Building Applications},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building design optimization is a highly complex problem, requiring long
   computational running processes because of the many options that exist
   when a building is being designed. This paper introduces an integrated
   approach through which to perform this optimization within an acceptable
   time frame. The approach includes the methods of variable selection,
   model simplification, and a sequential optimization process. Using
   singular value decomposition, a large number of design variables is
   reduced to a smaller subset that can be solved more quickly through the
   optimization algorithm. To expedite the variable selection process, a
   modeling approach that quickly simulates annual energy consumption was
   developed to replace full annual energy simulations. The developed
   methodology was applied to two residential buildings in the US, and the
   results are discussed herein. To assess the accuracy of the integrated
   optimization methodology, the optimized life cycle costs are compaa
   variables demonstrating the strongest contributions in the optimization
   study were identified. The proposed methodology significantly shortened
   the time requirements for the optimization processes of the two case
   studies by 74\% and 84\%; the optimized life cycle costs were within
   0.05\% and 0.06\%, respectively, of the optimum point.},

Abstract = {The new Green Building Code impacts the design and construction of
   building systems, which are vital for energy consumption estimation,
   especially since electricity prices are of great interest to today's
   consumers. Through the integration of energy consumption and utility
   bills, this paper presents the results of the economic impacts of
   installing various energy efficient systems required by the Green
   Building Code. Energy consumption prediction models are developed using
   multiple regression statistical methods based on electricity data
   collected from 110 single-family houses located in Los Angeles,
   California, USA. These prediction models have found a significant
   difference in electricity consumption of a single-family house prior to
   the introduction of the code and after its introduction. In addition,
   life cycle cost analysis on two of the featured systems, photovoltaic
   system and hybrid water heater, discovered that consumers can pay off
   their up-front investments in state-of-the-art energy efficient systems
   and appliances and earn a profit within the stated life cycle time
   period. The findings provide useful guidelines for making initial
   monetary decisions in the residential building industry.},

Abstract = {Considering the gaps in the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   modelling, this article aims to: i) present models that combine AI and
   environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), ii) analyse the role of AI in
   photovoltaics, smart grids and small-island economies. The methodology
   used is based upon selection of publications and analysis. Regarding
   LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental
   impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available.
   LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decisionmaking. However, it
   is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI
   environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides
   remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction
   of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics
   (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids,
   AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable
   energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and
   small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy
   plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are
   important. Generally speaking, and considering the above-mentioned
   issues, it can be argued that AI poses multiple challenges:
   machine-learning models on a large-scale basis; the internet of things;
   options to reduce negative environmental impacts and so on.},

Title = {On the Potential of District-Scale Life Cycle Assessments of Buildings},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate neutrality goals in the building sector require a large-scale
   estimation of environmental impacts for various stakeholders. Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is a viable method for this purpose. However, its high
   granularity, and subsequent data requirements and effort, hinder its
   propagation, and potential employment of Machine Learning (ML)
   applications on a larger scale. The presented paper outlines the current
   state of research and practice on district-scale building LCA in terms
   of standards, software and certifications, and data availability. For
   this matter, the authors present the development and application of two
   district-scale LCA tools, Teco and DisteLCA, to determine the Global
   Warming Potential (GWP) of three different residential districts. Both
   tools employ data based on (including, but not limited to) CityGML,
   TABULA, and oKOBAUDAT. The results indicate that DisteLCA's granular
   approach leads to an overestimation of environmental impacts, which can
   be derived from the statistical approach to operational energy use and
   related emissions. While both tools lead to substantial time savings,
   Teco requires less manual effort. The linkage of the aforementioned data
   sources has proven laborious and could be alleviated with a common data
   framework. Furthermore, large-scale data analysis could substantially
   increase the viability of the presented approach.},

Title = {Design variables affecting the environmental impacts of buildings: A
   critical review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {387},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Building sector is responsible for a large portion of global
   environmental impacts. The life-cycle environmental impacts of a
   building are largely determined by decisions made during design process.
   For making eco-friendly building design decisions, a prerequisite is to
   understand which design variables affect the environmental im-pacts of a
   building over its life cycle is. This research conducts a critical
   review to identify design variables affecting the environmental impacts
   of buildings at three design stages during the design processes.
   Publications between 2010 and 2022 (inclusive) are examined and 50
   papers are selected for review. The results reveal that eight design
   variables in early design stages, including (1) building aspect ratio,
   (2) window-to-wall ratio, (3) shading area, (4) building orientation,
   (5) number of floors, (6) building shape, (7) floor area and (8)
   floor-to-floor height, have an impact on a building's life-cycle
   environmental impacts. In detailed design stages, there are four kinds
   of design variables linked with the environmental impacts of a building:
   (1) types of building components, (2) sizes of building components, (3)
   types of building materials, and (4) thickness of building materials.
   Types of finishing materials are closely related to the environmental
   impacts of a building in con-struction design stages. The findings of
   this research help understand the contributors to the environmental
   impacts of a building from the perspective of building design. The
   findings also provide a future research di-rection on design variables
   for making eco-friendly building design.},

Abstract = {This empirical paper examines whether the age of software products can
   explain the turnaround between the release of security advisories and
   the publication vulnerability information. Building on the theoretical
   rationale of vulnerability life cycle modeling, this assertion is
   examined with an empirical sample that covers operating system releases
   from Microsoft and two Linux vendors. Estimation is carried out with a
   linear regression model. The results indicate that the age of the
   observed Microsoft products does not affect the turnaround times, and
   only feeble statistical relationships are present for the examined Linux
   releases. With this negative result, the paper contributes to the
   vulnerability life cycle modeling research by presenting and rejecting
   one theoretically motivated and previously unexplored question. The
   rejection is also a positive result; there is no reason for users to
   fear that the turnaround times would significantly lengthen as operating
   system releases age.},

Abstract = {In 2015, Taiwan's government announced the ``Greenhouse Gas Reduction
   and Management Act{''}, the goal of which was a 50\% reduction in carbon
   emissions by 2050, compared with 2005. The residential and commercial
   sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in
   Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much
   larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we
   considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2) of a building envelope renovation
   project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical
   row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones,
   orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via
   EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the
   results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings
   showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual
   energy consumption and LCCO2. With regard to annual energy consumption,
   the RMSE was 227.09 kW center dot h (per year) and the R-2 was 0.992.
   For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO(2)eq and the R-2 was 0.989, which
   indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early
   stages of building design and renovation.},

Abstract = {The late rise in global concern for environmental issues such as global
   warming and air pollution is accentuating the need for environmental
   assessments in the construction industry. Promptly evaluating the
   environmental loads of the various design alternatives during the early
   stages of a construction project and adopting the most environmentally
   sustainable candidate is therefore of large importance. Yet, research on
   the early evaluation of a construction project's environmental load in
   order to aid the decision making process is hitherto lacking. In light
   of this dilemma, this study proposes a model for estimating the
   environmental load by employing only the most basic information
   accessible during the early design phases of a project for the
   pre-stressed concrete (PSC) beam bridge, the most common bridge
   structure. Firstly, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the
   data from 99 bridges by integrating the bills of quantities (BOQ) with a
   life cycle inventory (LCI) database. The processed data was then
   utilized to construct a case based reasoning (CBR) model for estimating
   the environmental load. The accuracy of the estimation model was then
   validated using five test cases; the model's mean absolute error rates
   (MAER) for the total environmental load was calculated as 7.09\%. Such
   test results were shown to be superior compared to those obtained from a
   multiple-regression based model and a slab area base-unit analysis
   model. Henceforth application of this model during the early stages of a
   project is expected to highly complement environmentally friendly
   designs and construction by facilitating the swift evaluation of the
   environmental load from multiple standpoints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon
   emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural
   design decisions play a critical role in a building's carbon footprint,
   making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various
   design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building
   information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon
   architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of
   a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach
   to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It
   combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and
   building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies
   present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first
   case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating
   carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon
   footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use
   of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest
   optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions
   made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the
   form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a
   comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in
   enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.},

Title = {Investigating the embodied energy and carbon of buildings: A systematic
   literature review and meta-analysis of life cycle assessments},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment is a tool to quantify the environmental impact of
   products and has been widely studied in the building context. This is an
   important context given the building sector's substantial embodied
   energy and carbon. Against this backdrop, this study has two main
   objectives. The first objective is to create a benchmark the
   environmental impact of buildings. The second objective is to develop a
   procedural guideline that assists practitioners in decreasing the
   environmental impact of buildings. To achieve these objectives, a
   systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted to categorize
   and summarize relevant studies. A meta-analysis followed to synthesize
   the life cycle assessment results that emerged from the collected
   articles. The articles were categorized into two main groups: articles
   on construction materials and articles on entire buildings. Eight
   construction materials (i.e., concrete, reinforcement bars, structural
   steel, timber, tiles, insulation, and plaster) and three building types
   (i.e., concrete, timber, and steel) were identified, and related
   embodied energy and carbon were extracted. Subsequently, the data were
   analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings from
   the meta-analysis informed a regression model, which in turn informed a
   procedural guideline for practitioners who seek to reduce buildings'
   environmental impact. Further, the findings of this paper shed light on
   previously equivocal results concerning the impact of construction
   materials and buildings, but also support previous findings for
   structural materials, showing, for example, that the use of timber
   structures results in substantial savings over concrete structures in
   terms of both embodied energy (43\%) and carbon (68\%).},

Title = {Recurrent carbon footprint assessment and forecasting for conventional

Abstract = {Almost all life cycle assessment methods of carbon footprint for
   conventional housing in tropical region have either ignored the impacts
   of recurrent carbon or considered based on random assumptions. To ensure
   the green and sustainable urban built environment, particularly in
   tropical regions, an accurate monitoring and control of carbon footprint
   requires a comprehensive assessment of all phases of project life cycle,
   including maintenance. This article presents an innovative and dynamic
   approach of forecasting of carbon footprint including the recurrent
   carbon by combining a statistical (simple and multiple regression) and
   simulation (3D parametric prototyping) technique in a partial LCA
   (cradle to site) study for a tropical built environment. The developed
   multivariable regression model satisfied the statistical criteria of an
   efficient and consistent tool as the average percentage error of the
   predicted and observed values was found within the acceptable range. The
   average contribution of CO2 ranged from 2.0 tons to 40 tons for 25 to
   100 year of service life span. Ceramic tiles, false ceiling, plaster and
   roof tiles remained the top materials. The model validation observed an
   acceptable average error range from (-) 3.24\% to (+) 8\%. The study
   analyzed the factual recurrent carbon footprint impacts and justified
   the importance of its inclusion in preemptive mitigation toward
   sustainability concerns at very early stage of the housing project. (c)

Title = {Simulation optimisation towards energy efficient green buildings:
   Current status and future trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {254},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly
   recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a
   large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across
   material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing
   computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle
   environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There
   were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in
   various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the
   optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their
   strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges.
   Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the
   computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life
   cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim
   of identifying the current practices and future research need in this
   field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative
   structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were
   compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that
   come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the
   consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building
   systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the
   future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging
   digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and
   parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design
   exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As
   human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become
   important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design
   should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass
   both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {The new construction that is projected to take place between 2020 and
   2040 plays a critical role in embodied carbon emissions. The change in
   material selection is inversely proportional to the budget as the
   project progresses. Given the fact that early-stage design processes
   often do not include environmental performance metrics, there is an
   opportunity to investigate a toolset that enables early-stage design
   processes to integrate this type of analysis into the preferred workflow
   of concept designers. The value here is that early-stage environmental
   feedback can inform the crucial decisions that are made in the
   beginning, giving a greater chance for a building with better
   environmental performance in terms of its life cycle. This paper
   presents the development of a tool called LearnCarbon, as a plugin of
   Rhino3d, used to educate architects and engineers in the early stages
   about the environmental impact of their design. It facilitates two
   neural networks trained with the Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study by
   Carbon Leadership Forum, which learns the relationship between building
   geometry, typology, and construction type with the Global Warming
   potential (GWP) in tons of C02 equivalent (tCO2e). The first one, a
   regression model, can predict the GWP based on the massing model of a
   building, along with information about typology and location. The second
   one, a classification model, predicts the construction type given a
   massing model and target GWP. LearnCarbon can help improve the building
   life cycle impact significantly through early predictions of the
   structure's material and can be used as a tool for facilitating
   sustainable discussions between the architect and the client.},

Title = {Generation of whole building renovation scenarios using variational
   autoencoders},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {230},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Buildings consume a huge amount of energy, resulting in a considerable
   impact on the environment. In Canada, almost 70\% of the total energy
   used by the commercial and institutional sectors was consumed by
   Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems,
   which makes them the main targets of energy performance optimization
   methods. Furthermore, based on a governmental report, 40\% of Quebec
   university buildings are in poor or very poor shape regarding structure
   and materials, and require immediate renovation. Therefore, it is of
   utmost importance to reduce energy consumption, and this can be
   accomplished by improving the design of new buildings or by renovating
   existing ones. Moreover, Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization
   (SBMO) models can be used for optimizing and assessing different
   renovation scenarios considering Total Energy Consumption (TEC) and Life
   Cycle Cost (LCC). The time-consuming nature of SBMO has triggered the
   development of simplified and surrogate models within the design
   process. This study proposes a generative deep learning building energy
   model using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which could potentially
   overcome the current limitations. The proposed VAEs extract deep
   features from a whole building renovation dataset and generate
   renovation scenarios considering TEC and LCC of the existing
   institutional buildings. The proposed model also has the generalization
   ability due to its potential to reuse the dataset from a specific case
   in similar situations. The performance of the developed model has been
   demonstrated using a simulated renovation dataset to prove its
   potential. The results show that using generative VAEs is acceptable
   considering computational time and accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Estimation of life-cycle costs of buildings: regression vs artificial
   neural network},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-43},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of
   regression and artificial-neural-networks (ANNs) methods to estimate the
   running cost of building projects towards improved accuracy.
   Design/methodology/approach - A data set of 20 building projects is used
   to test the performance of these two (ANNs/regression) models in
   estimating running cost. The concept of cost-significantitems is
   identified as important in assisting estimation. In addition, a stepwise
   technique is used to eliminate insignificant factors in regression
   modelling. A connection weight method is applied to determine the
   importance of cost factors in the performance of ANNs.
   Findings - The results illustrate that the value of the coefficient of
   determination = 99.75 per cent for ANNs model(s), with a value of 98.1
   per cent utilising multiple regression (MR) model(s); second, the mean
   percentage error (MPE) for ANNs at a testing stage is 0.179, which is
   less than that of the MPE gained through MR modelling of 1.28; and
   third, the average accuracy is 99 per cent for ANNs model(s) and 97 per
   cent for MR model(s). On the basis of these results, it is concluded
   that an ANNs model is superior to a MR model when predicting running
   cost of building projects.
   Research limitations/implications - A means for continuous improvement
   for the performance of the models accuracy has been established; this
   may be further enhanced by future extended sample.
   Originality/value - This work extends the knowledge base of life-cycle
   estimation where ANNs method has been found to reduce preparation time
   consumed and increasing accuracy improvement of the cost estimation.},

Abstract = {Academic literature on machine learning modeling fails to address how to
   make machine learning models work for enterprises. For example, existing
   machine learning processes cannot address how to define business use
   cases for an AI application, how to convert business requirements from
   product managers into data requirements for data scientists, and how to
   continuously improve AI applications in term of accuracy and fairness,
   how to customize general purpose machine learning models with industry,
   domain, and use case specific data to make them more accurate for
   specific situations etc. Making AI work for enterprises requires special
   considerations, tools, methods and processes. In this paper we present a
   maturity framework for machine learning model lifecycle management for
   enterprises. Our framework is a re-interpretation of the software
   Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for machine learning model development
   process. We present a set of best practices from authors' personal
   experience of building large scale real-world machine learning models to
   help organizations achieve higher levels of maturity independent of
   their starting point.},

Title = {Effect of realistically estimated building lifespan on life cycle
   assessment: A case study in Korea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In the construction industry, estimating the realistic lifespan of
   buildings is essential to properly perform life cycle assessments
   (LCAs). It is impractical to consider all of the different factors
   affecting building lifespan; therefore, most LCAs assume a standard
   building lifespan for each major type of building structure. However,
   the lifespans of buildings vary significantly in practice, and applying
   a uniform lifespan to all buildings with the same structural type may
   lead to completely erroneous LCA results. In this study, LCAs of
   waterproofing methods on building models and actual buildings in Korea
   are used to empirically demonstrate the effect of realistic lifespan
   prediction using big data. Applying a more representative building
   lifespan of 5-39 years in the waterproofing LCAs of an architectural
   model decreased the carbon emissions in all phases (construction,
   operation and maintenance, and demolition) by 78-24\%, respectively,
   relative to a 50 year lifespan assumption. During the maintenance phase,
   the reductions were 100-31\%, respectively. The accuracy of the
   waterproofing LCAs of 17 real buildings became more irregular as the
   percentage error of the predicted lifespan increased, although the LCA
   analysis results had 0\% error for buildings with a predicted lifespan
   error of 6\% or less. Therefore, depending on the research purpose, a
   low-error predictive building lifespan model can evidently support
   accurate LCA results. This study proves that the use of a big data-based
   building lifespan prediction method is essential for LCA and is an
   effective tool for business planning and critical decision making
   throughout the construction process.},

Title = {Integrated climate-responsive thermal load ML model and cost/embodied
   energy estimate from a preliminary building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {304},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework applicable to preliminary building
   design that cohesively integrates material cost estimation, embodied
   energy assessment, and the prediction of the thermal demand of a
   building. At its core is a climate-responsive machine learning model
   specifically developed using readily accessible early-stage design data.
   This model forecasts the thermal demand both in the present and in the
   face of likely climatic shifts. To strike a balance in energy
   performance goals, material cost estimation is seamlessly incorporated.
   Building on the gradient boosting machine, the proposed approach showed
   better performance than other algorithms, predicting thermal demand 25
   to 37.5 times faster than conventional energy software without
   compromising accuracy. The key findings of the presented case studies
   highlight the significant influence of the Window-to-Wall ratio and
   floor thermal mass on thermal demand-especially in mitigating cooling
   demands posed by potential climate change scenarios. By enhancing
   interior floor types, heating demand can be reduced by nearly 49\%. The
   study further suggests that incorporating climate change considerations
   into life cycle energy designs is projected to amplify thermal and
   cooling loads by 32\% and 94\%, respectively, highlighting the crucial
   role of early design decisions in shaping sustainable and efficient
   buildings.},

Title = {Developing a model for energy retrofit in large building portfolios:
   Energy assessment, optimization and uncertainty},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {202},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, an increasing interest has been addressed to the energy
   efficiency of buildings. However, the focus has always been on
   individual properties, while both literature and practice still lack
   detailed solutions for entire stocks. Conversely, energy efficiency
   approaches should consider building portfolios as a whole, given that
   the deep decarbonisation of existing stocks would bring significant
   environmental and economic benefits.
   In this research paper, a decision support model has been developed for
   planning and managing energy retrofit operations in wide building
   portfolios. The core idea is to go beyond the single-building
   perspective and identify the level of energy retrofit that leads to the
   greatest possible benefit, comprising economic, environmental, human,
   and conservation targets. Energy improvement is here handled as an
   optimisation process, showing conflicting objectives and constraints. To
   this end, several techniques have been combined from various disciplines
   such as statistics, economics, energy modelling, operational research,
   and risk analysis, to develop a comprehensive and interdisciplinary
   methodology.
   Among the results of this research, the extreme flexibility in comparing
   countless design scenarios, the limited amount of buildings'
   characteristics required and the straightforwardness of the model
   developed are the most important contributions achieved. (C) 2019

Volume = {24},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {949-967},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The present study aims to determine and model CO2 emissions based on the
   energy savings through the thermal insulation applied to the external
   walls of the buildings for eighty-one different zones using four diverse
   thermal insulation materials. Depending on the by life cycle cost
   analysis (LCCA) and the number of degree-days, optimum insulation
   thicknesses were determined in the present study, in which the heating
   and cooling needs of the buildings were considered separately. The net
   savings associated with insulated buildings were also calculated,
   including the optimum insulation thickness and the payback period for
   the insulation applied. In buildings with thermal insulation, it has
   been determined that CO2 emissions will be reduced by approximately
   66-76\% during the heating season and by 46-69\% during the cooling
   season. Moreover, the amount of CO2 emissions released into the
   atmosphere from uninsulated and insulated buildings was modeled with ten
   polynomial-type functions derived from the MATLAB R2019a program. The
   model results controlled by regression analyses revealed statistical
   suitability. These models demonstrate a more advantageous approach than
   prior studies for determining the annual total CO2 emissions per unit
   area of the exterior walls of buildings. This study is intended to
   assist housing authorities and designers in making informed decisions
   about energy savings in buildings.

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are
   introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control
   towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect
   complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process
   optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle
   management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the
   real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of
   Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with
   proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building
   asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability,
   interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM
   to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were
   performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability,
   interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides
   decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation
   of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of
   CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as
   integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.},

Abstract = {Buildings are the world's largest contributors to energy demand,
   greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, resource consumption and waste
   generation. An unmissable opportunity exists to tackle climate change,
   global warming, and resource scarcity by rethinking how we approach
   building design. Structural materials often dominate the total mass of a
   building; therefore, a significant potential for material efficiency and
   GHG emissions mitigation is to be found in efficient structural design
   and use of structural materials.
   To this end, environmental impact assessment methods, such as life cycle
   assessment (LCA), are increasingly used. However, they risk failing to
   deliver the expected benefits due to the high number of parameters and
   uncertainty factors that characterise impacts of buildings along their
   lifespans. Additionally, effort and cost required for a reliable
   assessment seem to be major barriers to a more widespread adoption of
   LCA. More rapid progress towards reducing building impacts seems
   therefore possible by combining established environmental impact
   assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches such as
   machine learning and neural networks.
   This short communication will briefly present previous attempts to
   employ such techniques in civil and structural engineering. It will
   present likely outcomes of machine learning and neural network
   applications in the field of structural engineering and - most
   importantly - it calls for data from professionals across the globe to
   form a fundamental basis which will enable quicker transition to a more
   sustainable built environment.},

Abstract = {The study conducts a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of
   precast sandwich panels by integrating operational and embodied phases
   detailing thermal efficiency and environmental impacts. The analytical
   regression model is developed for climatic diversity and design
   variables using the energy rating tool FirstRate5 to compare with a
   conventional brick veneer construction. LCA is performed on the building
   information modeling (BIM) platform to connect operational energy and
   express the relative embodied impacts of insulation constituents,
   compressive strength, reinforcement, and mix design. Monte Carlo
   simulation shows significant advantages of concrete sandwich panels in
   reducing operational H/C loads over building service life. LCA reveals a
   100 mm thick external precast concrete wall with 50\% fly ash reduces
   CO2 emission and energy demand by 54.7\% and 75.9\% consecutively
   against the benchmark. Moreover, it comprises 84.31\% of the total
   building mass, accountable for only 53.27\% of total CO2 emission and
   27.25\% of energy demand, which is comparatively lower than other
   materials. In the case of selecting lining insulation, a broader benefit
   is identified for extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene
   (EPS) boards due to their relative weight, thickness, and environmental
   impacts. Representative equations of energy efficiency and impact
   assessment will assist in adopting sandwich panels for new construction
   and refurbishment with relative dimensions.},

Abstract = {The engineering design process has fundamentally impacted the life cycle
   of construction projects and notably, the engineering performance is
   significantly measured in delivering projects. Previous studies on
   engineering performance have established the cause-effect relationships
   between project variables and performance measures. Recently, the
   building information modeling (BIM) application has reformed how owners
   execute the engineering, construction, commissioning, and operation in
   the industry. There has been an increasing focus in finding the benefits
   of BIM on project performance, however, a minor focus has been given to
   engineering performance. This paper proposes an artificial neural
   network (ANN) machine learning multilayer perceptron (MLMP) method and
   linear regression (LR) that correlates the use of BIM with engineering
   performance for better construction project assessment. The conclusions
   reveal a high-level correlation measure between BIM use inputs and
   engineering performance outputs and further methods for evaluating the
   engineering performance. Furthermore, we achieved and validated the best
   prediction by leveraging data from 60 samples using the MLMP and LR
   models.},

Title = {Eco-efficiency in early design decisions: A multimethodology approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {283},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Eco-efficiency is a key concept encompassing economic and environmental
   aspects to promote a more efficient use of resources and lower
   emissions. An eco-efficiency perspective in the design of products and
   services is thus essential in the pursuit of sustainability. This
   article proposes a novel decision-support methodological approach to
   assess the environmental impacts and costs in early design stages, aimed
   at providing informed recommendations to designers, manufacturers and
   decision-makers. This multimethodology approach integrates a streamlined
   life-cycle environmental and cost assessment with a data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) model that derives eco-efficiency ratios and compares
   alternative designs, without the need to subjectively weigh the
   different environmental and cost life-cycle metrics. A linear regression
   model is then used to indicate the most influential decision variables.
   This approach was applied to a retrofit process of a historic
   residential building located in Southern Europe. The metrics used to
   assess the design parameters are: climate change, acidification,
   eutrophication, non-renewable primary energy, and net present value. A
   sensitivity analysis on the decarbonization of the electricity mix was
   also performed. The multimethodology offers valuable guidance to allow
   decision-makers to progressively specify the decision variables in an
   iterative way, using robust methods allowing for the statistical
   validation of results. The case study revealed robust empirical results
   for building retrofits in Southern European climates, indicating that
   the variables that most impact eco-efficiency (in both short and
   long-term) are roof insulation thickness and material followed by
   exterior wall insulation material. After three variables specification,
   the average eco-efficiency always increased, with higher gains obtained
   for the scenarios with the current electricity mix (22-25\% increase)
   and more modest gains obtained for the electricity decarbonization
   scenarios (8-15\% increase). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the NetFlinCS framework, which allows a fast
   and effective development of computeintensive interactive applications
   for mobile devices using hybrid cloud technologies. In addition, we show
   its advantages by using the proposed technology to build a context-based
   detection and surveillance application for construction sites, which
   aggregates all relevant data during architecture planning and the
   construction process for documentation and later use in facility
   management. The NetFlinCS framework enables rich Mixed Reality
   techniques like sensor fusion over multiple mobile devices or AI-based
   recognition as well as the integration of databases to enable an
   automatic detection of discrepancies based on common tracking
   technologies. The device uses the location awareness to process the
   camera stream in the context of the local planning data. To reduce the
   client's workload as well as for better scalability and to enable the
   heavy use of machine learning techniques, we use a hybrid cloud
   environment that consists of all available servers and clients to
   outsource expensive calculations. The hybrid cloud backend provides
   different services like machine learning based segmentation, inpainting,
   and scene classification that support navigation, video processing, and
   error estimation in real-time. By deeply integrating standard data
   formats like the Industry Foundation Classes standard and Building
   Information Modeling it is possible to compare these databases with
   tracking data to detect and localize discrepancies over the whole life
   cycle of a building, from planning data (blueprints, architectural
   models, etc.) up to the real building.},

Title = {Assessment and regression of carbon emissions from the building and
   construction sector in China: A provincial study using machine learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {450},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The building and construction sector is a major contributor to carbon
   emissions in China. Hence, it is crucial to explore the characteristics
   and trends of building carbon emissions to achieve the carbon peak and
   neutrality. While previous studies have made efforts to analyze the
   influencing factors through different approaches, developing an
   effective and intelligent regression model based on machine learning
   algorithms remains challenging in predicting the carbon emission trend.
   This study analyzed carbon emissions and per capita indicators of the
   building and construction sector in 30 provincial regions in China from
   2005 to 2021. While embodied and operational carbon emissions contribute
   equally to the total emissions, the results showed a significant
   spatialtemporal correlation. Considering the emissions as target
   features, nine alternative machine learning regression models were
   developed using eight identified explanatory features incorporating
   scale, economic, technological, and classification factors. Based on
   performance metrics encompassing root mean squared error, coefficient of
   determination, and mean absolute percentage error, the stacking ensemble
   regression model was identified to have superior performance. This model
   was further employed to conduct a sensitivity analysis of explanatory
   features on carbon emissions. The results indicated that urbanization
   rate and population were the most sensitive factors, with varying
   effects on different target features. These findings can be used to
   predict carbon emission trends and promote carbon reduction policies in
   the building industry.},

Title = {Development of a new methodology to optimize building life cycle cost,
   environmental impacts, and occupant satisfaction},

Abstract = {Thermal comfort and occupant thermal satisfaction are critical aspects
   in the indoor environment quality assessment and have received
   considerable attention by designers and building occupants. Improper
   indoor temperature not only decreases the level of occupant thermal
   satisfaction, but also has serious health related consequences. Despite
   the importance of occupant thermal satisfaction that has been vastly
   emphasized, studies incorporating occupants' satisfaction during the
   design process are very limited. Therefore, this study aims to develop a
   multi-objective design optimization model to minimize life cycle cost
   and life cycle emission, and maximize occupant satisfaction level in a
   typical commercial building. To solve the multi-objective optimization
   problem, a Harmony Search based algorithm is developed and employed.
   Moreover, to identify the level of design thermal satisfaction, a novel
   utility theory based thermal comfort index is defined and calculated. A
   small office building is selected as a case study to analyze four
   different designs which are identified as optimum solutions. To
   determine the optimum designs, the satisfaction level of all the design
   combinations having cost and emissions similar to previously
   distinguished optimum solutions are compared and best designs are
   identified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 6},
Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has grown in popularity in the software industry
   due to its ability to solve complex problems. Developing ML systems
   involves more uncertainty and risk because it requires identifying a
   business opportunity and managing source code, data, and trained models.
   Our research aims to identify the existing practices used in the
   industry for building ML applications and comprehending the
   organizational complexity of adopting ML systems. We conducted a
   multivocal literature review and then created a taxonomy of the
   practices applied to the ML system life cycle discussed among
   practitioners and researchers. The core of the study emerged from 41
   selected posts from the grey literature and 37 selected scientific
   papers. Applying Initial Coding and Focused Coding techniques into these
   data, we mapped 91 practices into six core categories related to
   designing, developing, testing, and deploying ML systems. The results,
   including a taxonomy of practices, provide organizations with valuable
   insights to identify gaps in their current ML processes and practices
   and a roadmap for improving, optimizing, and managing ML systems.},

Title = {Techniques and tools for integrating building material stock analysis
   and life cycle assessment at the urban scale: A systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {262},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The urban building stock has a high demand for materials and energy,
   exerting tremendous pressure on natural resources. A current research
   trend is to integrate Building Material Stock (BMS) analysis with Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate energy use, material stock/flows, and
   related environmental performance associated with the life cycle of
   building stocks. Compared with urban building energy modelling (UBEM),
   material-related analysis is a relatively new topic. Some studies
   applied new techniques and tools to improve the modelling and the
   dynamic evolution of the BMS system. However, there is a lack of
   comprehensive review studies summarising the recent publications on
   these applications. Therefore, this study conducts a comprehensive
   literature review, primarily focusing on examining the tools and
   techniques employed for integrating ``BMS-LCA{''}at the urban scale.
   This review includes 99 articles chosen from a pool of 557 related
   papers (in the recent decade), systematically retrieved from Scopus and
   Web of Science , along with additional manual searches. Through a
   comprehensive bibliometric and content-based synthesis analysis of
   selected literature, this paper synthesises the techniques/tools used
   for effectively completing various analysis phases of ``BMS-LCA{''},
   including data collection and processing, stock modelling and analysis,
   and result evaluations. Key findings highlight the significance of
   integrating artificial intelligence and geospatial technology in
   optimising data collection, machine learning and data-driven models in
   enhancing building stock aggregation and classification, and innovative
   application of relevant LCA software and databases in facilitating BMS's
   LCA, etc. This review provides a valuable reference for researchers in
   future investigations, as it identifies novel ways of applying
   techniques/tools and opportunities for methodology improvement in the
   urban-level ``BMS-LCA{''}study.},

Title = {Energy retrofitting of hospital buildings considering climate change: An
   approach integrating automated machine learning with NSGA-III for
   multi-objective optimization},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {319},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In the context of sustainable development, energy-saving renovation of
   existing buildings can not only effectively reduce energy consumption
   but also improvement the residential comfort and office environments.
   This study proposes an optimization method for building energy-saving
   renovation based on automated machine learning and the NSGA-III
   algorithm, aiming at efficiently and accurately identifying the best
   energy-saving renovation schemes. The results showed that automated
   machine learning could provide a predictive model for multiobjective
   optimization analysis in a relatively short training time, with an
   average prediction accuracy of over 95\%. And the Stacked Ensemble
   algorithm and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm perform the best among
   all the algorithms considered in this study. Additionally, climate
   change significantly affects the energy-saving benefits and thermal
   comfort performance of renovation measures, thereby altering the choice
   of optimal schemes. The final renovation schemes obtained through the
   NSGA-III and entropy weight TOPSIS method can achieve an energy saving
   rate of 22.06\% to 26.48\% under typical climate scenarios, while also
   improving thermal comfort time by 31.87\% to 43.73\%. In future climate
   scenarios, an energy saving rate of 32.73\% to 33.02\% and a thermal
   comfort time of 40.20\% to 42.29\% can be achieved. Combining these two
   technologies can quickly and effectively find the best balance among
   energy consumption, whole life cycle cost, and thermal comfort time. The
   method proposed in this paper offers new perspectives and tools for
   researchers in the field of building energy conservation, demonstrating
   the application potential of automated machine learning and the NSGA-III
   algorithm in the energy-saving renovation of hospital buildings.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Maintenance costs of all types of buildings are most often ignored since
   they are incurred in the future. Potential investors are interested in
   capital costs-construction costs-while maintenance costs are considered
   as unimportant in the life cycle of a building. If there were a larger
   number of maintenance cost estimation models, it would be possible to
   estimate these costs and present them to potential investors more
   easily, thus making it easier and more effective to apply life cycle
   cost methods. A study on the characteristics and costs of the
   maintenance of sewer systems in the Republic of Croatia was conducted,
   wherein questionnaires were sent to companies operating public sewer
   systems. The data requested in the questionnaires were general data on
   enterprises, maintenance, data on sewer systems, quantities of sewer
   discharge, sewer pipes and data on maintenance costs of sewer systems.
   It was established that it is possible to use linear regression when
   creating a model for estimating the maintenance costs of a sewer system.},

   result in a large set of part variants. Thus, the required effort for
   logistics planning and, in particular, for packaging planning is
   increasing. This paper proposes an approach to automate the assignment
   of packaging for an individual part based on its characteristics using
   machine learning. We use the historical data of product parts and their
   packaging specifications to train our two-step machine learning model.
   Consequently, the model is able to propose a packaging with an accuracy
   of 84\% in comparison with real-world data. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {Considering critical building materials for embodied carbon emissions in
   buildings: A machine learning-based prediction model and tool},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Construction activities discharge considerable carbon emissions, causing
   serious environmental problems and gaining increasing attention. For the
   large-scale construction area, high emission intensity, and significant
   carbon reduction potential, embodied carbon emissions of buildings worth
   special studying. However, previous studies are usually post-evaluation
   and ignore the influences of project, construction and management. This
   paper focuses on critical building materials and adopts machine learning
   methods to realize carbon prediction at design stage. The activity data,
   including critical building materials, water, and energy consumption, is
   analyzed and 30 influencing factors at the project, construction, and
   management levels are identified. Three algorithms (artificial neural
   network, support vector regression and extreme gradient boosting) are
   used to develop machine learning models. The proposed methodology is
   applied to 70 projects in the Yangtze River Delta region of China.
   Results show that the established models achieved high interpretability
   (R2 >0.7) and small average error (5.33\%), well proving theirs
   feasibility. Furthermore, an automated tool is developed to assist
   practitioners to predict the critical materials consumption and embodied
   carbon emissions conveniently. The proposed operable model and practical
   tool can efficiently support effective adjustments and improvement to
   reduce carbon in construction.},

Title = {The mesoscale convection life cycle: Building block or prototype for
   large-scale tropical waves?},

Abstract = {A cumulonimbus cloud may ascend and spawn its anvil cloud,
   precipitation, and downdrafts within an hour or so. This paper inquires
   why a similar progression of events (life cycle) is observed for
   tropical weather fluctuations with time scales of hours, days, and even
   weeks. Regressions using point data illustrate the characteristic unit
   of rain production: the mesoscale convective system (MCS), covering tens
   of kilometers and lasting several hours, with embedded convective rain
   cells. Meanwhile, averages over larger spatial areas indicate a
   self-similar progression from shallow to deep convection to stratiform
   anvils on many time scales.
   Synthetic data exercises indicate that simple superpositions of
   fixed-structure MCS life cycles (the Building Block hypothesis) cannot
   explain why longer period life cycles are similar. Rather, it appears
   that an MCS may be a small analogue or prototype of larger scale waves.
   Multiscale structure is hypothesized to occur via a Stretched Building
   Block conceptual model, in which the widths (durations) of zones of
   shallow, deep, and stratiform anvil clouds in MCSs are modulated by
   larger scale waves.
   Temperature (T) and humidity (q) data are examined and fed into an
   entraining plume model, in an attempt to elucidate their relative roles
   in these large-scale convection zone variations. T profile variations,
   with wavelengths shorter than troposphere depth, appear important for
   high-frequency (similar to 2-5-day period) convectively coupled waves,
   as density directly links convection (via buoyancy) and large-scale wave
   dynamics (via restoring force). Still, the associated q anomalies are
   several times greater than adiabatic, suggesting a strong amplification
   by shallow convective feedbacks. For lower frequency (intraseasonal)
   variability, q anomalies are considerably larger compared to T, and may
   be dominant. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Probabilistic behavioral modeling in building performance simulation: A
   Monte Carlo approach},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {128-141},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The increased awareness on sustainability matters is contributing to the
   evolution of energy and environmental policies for the building sector
   at the EU level, oriented toward resource efficiency. There exist today
   several possible strategies to model building performance through the
   life cycle. The increase of available computational capacity and of data
   acquisition capability is opening new scenarios for practical
   applications, which can contribute to the reduction of the gap usually
   encountered between simulated and measured energy performance. This
   article aims to investigate an approach for probabilistic building
   performance simulation to be used across life cycle phases, employing
   reduced-order models for performance monitoring and energy management.
   The workflow proposed aims to establish a continuity among design and
   operation phases. Design phase simulation is generally subject to
   relevant temporal and economic constraints and a successful workflow
   should incorporate elements from current design practices but should
   also add new features, which have to be reasonably automated to reduce
   additional effort. Therefore, the workflow proposed is automated and
   tested for robustness using Monte Carlo technique. In the design phase,
   the approach can be used for identifying probabilistic performance
   bounds suitable for risk analysis in energy efficiency investments,
   employing cost-optimal or life cycle cost accounting methodologies. In
   the operation phase, it can be used for performance monitoring and
   energy management based on daily energy consumption analysis, similarly
   to other multivariate regression-based methods at the state of the art,
   addressing the problem of maintaining energy consumption and related
   costs constantly under control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Holistic analysis and prediction of life cycle cost for vertical
   greenery systems in Singapore},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed the emerging and development of vertical
   greenery systems (VGS) or green walls as an alternative to enhance the
   quality of urban environments, especially for high-density cities.
   Although previous studies have calculated the life cycle cost (LCC) of
   VGS, the conventional method is time-consuming and requires a large
   amount of detailed data, which is unable and unpractical to obtain LCC
   of new VGS projects by collecting data of only several key variables of
   VGS. Hence, after computing and analyzing the LCC of 40 cases from
   different projects with various types, sizes, and other attributes, our
   study established a prediction model for the LCC of VGS using the data
   from forty cases of three types of VGS. Multiple linear regression
   (MLR), MLR with stepwise regression, and orthogonal partial least square
   (OPLS) models were built and compared. And the OPLS model was selected
   as the prediction model as it has relatively good prediction performance
   and can avoid the collinearity issue encountered by the other two
   methods. Furthermore, the combined OPLS model for three types of VGS was
   separated into three individual models with improved total prediction
   accuracy (85.4\%? 95.5\%). In addition, key variables affecting the LCC
   of different types of VGS were also identified including salary, plant
   density, plant price, etc. Applications of LCC prediction models for VGS
   for various stakeholders were discussed to conclude the study.},

Title = {Framework on low-carbon retrofit of rural residential buildings in arid
   areas of northwest China: A case study of Turpan residential buildings},

Abstract = {At present, buildings in arid and hot regions are facing severe
   challenges of indoor comfort improvement and carbon emission reduction,
   especially in rural areas. Multi-objective optimization could be an
   effective tool for tackling the aforementioned challenges. Therefore,
   this paper proposes a life-cycle optimization framework considering
   thermal comfort, which is beneficial to promoting residents' motivation
   for low-carbon retrofit in arid climate regions. First, in response to
   the above problems, three objective functions are specified in the
   framework, which are global warming potential (GWP), life cycle cost
   (LCC), and thermal discomfort hours (TDH). To improve the optimization
   efficiency, this research uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) combined with
   NSGA-II to construct a high-precision prediction model (meta-model for
   optimization) based on the energy consumption simulation database formed
   by the orthogonal multi-dimensional design parameters. The accuracy
   index of the modified model is R-2 > 0.99, cv(RMSE) <= 1\%, and NMBE <=
   0.2\%, which gets rid of the dilemma of low prediction accuracy of
   traditional machine learning models. In the scheme comparison and
   selection stage, the TOPSIS based on two empowerment methods is applied
   to meet different design tendencies, where the entropy-based method can
   avoid the interference of subjective preference and significantly
   improve the objectivity and scientific nature of decision analysis.
   Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the variables, which
   supports guidance for practitioners to carry out the low-carbon design.
   Finally, the multi-objective optimization analysis for a farmhouse in
   Turpan is taken as a case study to evaluate the performance of the
   framework. The results show that the framework could significantly
   improve the building performance, with 60.8\%, 52.5\%, and 14.2\%
   reduction in GWP, LCC, and TDH, respectively.},

Abstract = {The development of sustainable concrete in achieving the developmental

   order to move towards sustainability, the utilization of the by-products

   ratio (Ag/B), and plasticizer to binder ratio (PL/B) were used in this
   exercise. At the end of the protocol, it is observed that the
   constituents' ratios are dependent on the behavior of the whole, which
   can be solved by using the proposed model equations and mix design
   charts. The models performed optimally, as none showed any performance
   below 80\%. However, ANN, which predicted Fc03, Fc07, Fc28, Fc60, Fc90,
   Ft28, Ff28 \& Fb28, S, Ec28 \& K28, and P with an accuracy of greater
   than 95\% each with average error of less than 9.4\% each, is considered
   the decisive technique in predicting all the studied concrete
   properties, including the life cycle assessment potential of the
   concrete materials.},

Abstract = {Research on autonomous ships has led to several ideas about how they
   could be operated in terms of level of automation and human presence.
   However, all seem to point towards systems that will be more complex due
   to issues such as the tighter integration with software and the
   interactions with humans-in-the-loop. These ships will likely be
   completely different compared to conventional ones, which puts into
   question the usefulness of our current understanding of risk and how it
   is managed for ensuring safe operation. By a critical review of the
   literature, this paper highlights the need for advanced methods that
   will combine machine learning and simulation for dynamically assessing
   risk in a life cycle context and effectively transferring acquired
   operational knowledge back to the design phase. The main objective of
   this paper is to describe a novel life cycle risk framework for
   developing algorithms inspired by the biological immune system, which
   provides lifetime protection from harmful pathogens. This framework can
   be used to construct machine learning algorithms for dynamic risk
   monitoring and adaptive risk control that address different types of
   risk, while enabling faster future response to previously unencountered
   risks and operational feedback to design through learning. We
   demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a specific maritime
   context with a case study on collision risk identification. Considering
   the lack of experience for autonomous ships, the benefit of our
   immune-inspired approach is that it departs from the classic risk
   scenario concept and that it does not rely on safety performance data
   for identifying risk factors and training the algorithms. We suggest
   this framework is particularly suitable for autonomous ships with high
   levels of autonomy, although applicable to conventional ships as well,
   as it can contribute to empowering them with risk awareness and the
   capability to deal with any risk environment.},

Abstract = {Our data scientists are adept in using machine learning algorithms and
   building model out of it, and they are at ease with their local machine
   to do them. But, when it comes to building the same model from the
   platform, they find it slightly challenging and need assistance from the
   platform team. Based on the survey results, the major challenge was
   platform complexity, but it is hard to deduce actionable items or
   accurate details to make the system simple. The complexity feedback was
   very generic, so we decided to break it down into two logical
   challenges: Education \& Training and Simplicity-of-Platform. We have
   developed a system to find these two challenges in our platform, which
   we call an Analyzer. In this paper, we explain how it was built and it's
   impact on the evolution of our machine learning platform. Our work aims
   to address these challenges and provide guidelines on how to empower
   machine learning platform team to know the data scientist's bottleneck

Title = {Developing data-driven surrogate models for holistic performance-based
   assessment of mid-rise RC frame buildings at early design},
Journal = {ENGINEERING STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {245},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {This paper presents a framework to develop generalizable surrogate
   models to predict seismic vulnerability and environmental impacts of a
   class of buildings at a particular location. To this end, surrogate
   models are trained on a performance inventory, here simulation-based
   seismic and environmental assessments of 720 mid-rise concrete office
   buildings of variable topology in Charleston, South Carolina. Five
   surrogate models of multiple regression, random forest, extreme gradient
   boosting, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors were trained in
   a machine-learning pipeline including hyperparameter tuning and
   cross-validation. Variance-based sensitivity and accumulated local
   effect analysis were performed on the most accurate model to identify
   the most influential parameters and interpret the trained surrogate
   model. Support vector machines achieved the highest accuracy for total
   annual loss with an average 10-fold adjusted R2 of 0.96, whereas simpler
   linear regression was adequate to estimate the initial and
   seismic-induced embodied carbon emission. Floor area, building height,
   lateral-resisting frame weight, and average beam section sizes were
   found to be the most influential features. As these features may be
   approximated by an experienced structural engineer the results indicate
   that, with suitable performance inventories available, it should be
   possible to employ surrogate models in early design to narrow the
   initial design space to highly resilient and sustainable configurations.},

Abstract = {Excessive carbon emissions are driving global warming and greenhouse
   effects, demanding urgent global intervention. The construction
   industry, a significant contributor to both energy consumption and
   carbon emissions, plays a pivotal role in addressing emissions within
   this sector. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the factors
   influencing carbon emissions throughout the entire life -cycle of
   buildings in Jiangsu Province, China. Furthermore, it seeks to evaluate
   and forecast carbon emissions in the province's construction sector for
   the upcoming decade. To accomplish this, the paper employs a
   multivariate linear regression model, the Technique for Order Preference
   by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, and the Autoregressive
   Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) model to assess and forecast
   residential building carbon emissions in the 13 prefectural -level
   cities in Jiangsu Province, China. The research findings indicate that
   various factors have substantial impacts on the overall carbon emissions
   throughout a life -cycle of a building. Notably, total carbon emissions
   exhibit a positive correlation with energy consumption and a negative
   correlation with energy sources. The results of this study offer
   valuable insights for optimizing carbon emissions associated with
   building construction and present opportunities for reducing emissions
   from buildings. Furthermore, this research holds significant
   implications for shaping low -carbon policies in other cities,
   emphasizing the need for immediate global efforts to control carbon
   emissions.},

Journal = {CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building materials and components account for about 10\% of the world's
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Carbonate decomposition and fuel
   combustion from the cement production process are responsible for almost
   7\% of carbon dioxide emissions. Since clinker is the most impacting
   component of ordinary Portland cement, this paper presents a statistical
   analysis of the life cycle impacts of 41 recipes of grey clinker
   produced in Europe from 2015 to 2023 to identify the consumption impact
   categories (e.g., fossil fuels, renewable and nonrenewable secondary
   fuels) which better explain the assessment of the Global Warming
   Potential (GWP), typically exploited to quantify the environmental
   impact of clinker production. More in detail, several regression methods
   are applied to the available dataset to build predictive models for GWP
   and to determine the most relevant impact categories. The regression
   models are then compared with respect to their statistical accuracy and
   goodness of fit. The results provide information that can support cement
   producers in developing lowimpacting cement recipes.},

   during building's lifecycle using designing factors: a case study of
   residential buildings in Tianjin, China},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {204},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Many studies have been conducted on life cycle assessment and control
   measures for carbon emissions of buildings. Methods proposed by these
   studies usually require not only specific accounting model, but also
   detailed inventory data, which is not available at early design stage.
   Seeing that the importance of design phase to carbon emissions during
   building's lifecycle, a study on regression model of carbon emissions
   using designing factors was done. Firstly, based on process analysis
   method, the carbon emissions of 207 residential buildings in Tianjin
   were calculated. The results show that annual carbon emissions per floor
   area are between 30 and 60 kgCO(2)/(m(2).year), with manufacture phase
   and operation phase accounting for 11\%-25\% and 75\%-87\%,
   respectively. Then, correlation analysis and elastic net were used to
   determine 12 designing factors for predictive model; At last, four
   regression techniques, PCR, RF, MLP and SVR were used to develop
   regression models, respectively; comparison and process analysis of
   model development were given later. The results show that SVR has the
   optimal predictive accuracy among four models, its corresponding
   coefficient of determination can reach to 0.800. This regression model
   can be utilized to estimate carbon emissions based on designing factors,
   which can help designers make a strategic decision at early stage. (C)

Title = {Estimation models for heating energy and electricity costs},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {34},
Number = {9},
Pages = {622-640},
Abstract = {Heating energy and electricity represent a significant proportion of the
   overall financial expenditures over the life cycle of buildings and play
   a decisive role in the assessment of ecological quality. To ensure
   ecological and economical sustainability, the planning and construction
   of energy efficient buildings have become increasingly important. The
   present study introduces statistical models for the estimation of energy
   costs during the planning process as well as for the purpose of
   monitoring and controlling costs during operation including a wide range
   of facility types. Based on a data sample of 206 occupied facilities
   located in Germany, regression models are presented in detail including
   significant predictor variables. The provision of correctly specified
   models as well as a consistent and unbiased estimation beyond the
   employed data is verified by validation tests. The practical
   significance of the determined variables is presented by the calculation
   of various scenarios. The best estimation accuracy is indicated for

Title = {Enhanced Environmental Sustainability for the Acoustic Absorption
   Properties of Cabuya Fiber in Building Construction Using Machine
   Learning Predictive Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sustainability in construction is a growing concern due to the
   significant polluting waste generated before, during, and after a
   building's life cycle. The use of natural materials can significantly
   reduce the environmental footprint in obtaining, manufacturing,
   transportation, execution, use, maintenance, and demolition of the
   building, especially when locally sourced. Natural fibers, in
   particular, can be used in room acoustics, offering good acoustic
   absorption while meeting sustainability goals. The objectives of this
   paper are to evaluate cabuya fiber, grown in Ecuador, as an acoustic
   absorbing material and to introduce a novel approach using machine
   learning to simulate the material's acoustic properties. Eight samples
   of cabuya fiber, bound with a solution of water and Ca(OH)2, were
   prepared with thicknesses between 12 and 30.6 mm. The sound absorption
   coefficients (SACs) were calculated using an impedance tube, following
   international standards. A Gaussian regression model was built for the
   predictions. The results showed that the 30.6 mm sample achieved maximum
   absorption coefficients of 0.91 at 2 kHz and 0.9 at 5 kHz. The model
   predictions are very accurate, with a mean square error of just 0.0002.
   These findings offer valuable insights into using cabuya fiber and
   advanced predictive models to enhance building acoustic performance and
   reduce environmental impact.},

Title = {Analysis of the influencing factors of external wall ceramic claddings'
   service life using regression techniques},
Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {141-155},

Abstract = {Buildings' facades play an important role in the protection of buildings
   and, therefore, their envelope system must comply with its function,
   fulfilling the performance requirements and withstanding the external
   environmental agents during the buildings' life cycle. Although the
   degradation of buildings is a natural process, there are various factors
   that influence their durability. The assessment of the buildings'
   durability and service life is a research field that brings together
   several knowledge areas, e.g. construction technology, building physics
   and meteorology. This paper intends to identify the main factors that
   influence the durability of adhesive ceramic external wall claddings,
   developing models to predict their service life that involve these
   variables. The service life prediction models proposed in this study are
   defined based on simple and multiple regression analysis, both linear
   and nonlinear. The proposed models are defined based on the in situ
   evaluation of the degradation condition of 96 ceramic claddings of
   residential buildings in Brasilia. The methodology led to coherent
   results and its applicability and adequacy to predict the service life
   of ceramic claddings in Brasilia is demonstrated. The knowledge
   regarding the influence of the facades' characteristics on their
   durability is extremely useful to designers, in order to improve the
   selection of a given cladding for a specific situation, and to managers
   and stakeholders, allowing the optimization of maintenance policies and
   thus increasing the sustainability of the solutions adopted during the
   buildings' life cycle.},

Title = {A probabilistic life-cycle assessment of carbon emission from magnesium
   phosphate cementitious material with uncertainty analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {427},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {This study aims to quantify the carbon emission intensity of magnesium
   phosphate cementitious materials to explore its potential in carbon
   emission reduction. However, comprehensive research on the lifecycle
   carbon emissions of these materials remains scarce, plagued by issues of
   data uncertainty, accessibility, and scoping discrepancies. Therefore, a
   probabilistic lifecycle assessment approach was adopted in this study,
   enabling un-certainty analysis of the carbon emission intensity of
   magnesium phosphate cementitious materials. The findings indicate that
   the 10.5th percentile of the carbon emission intensity simulations for
   MPC stands at 0.624 kgCO2e/ kg, suggesting that nearly 90\% of the
   values surpass those of OPC, thereby refuting the presumption of its
   low-carbon attributes. Notably, the consumption and carbon emission
   factors of magnesium oxide and soluble phosphates emerge as pivotal
   influences on its carbon emissions. Additionally, a multiple linear
   regression model was employed to forecast the correlation between the
   constituents of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials and the
   volume of carbon emissions. Through this study, we can have a more
   comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of
   magnesium phosphate cementitious materials in terms of carbon emission
   reduction, which will provide an important support for the selection and
   design of future green building materials.},

Title = {Machine Learning Methods in Damage Prediction of Masonry Development
   Exposed to the Industrial Environment of Mines},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of comparative studies on the
   implementation of machine learning methods in the damage intensity
   assessment of masonry buildings. The research was performed on existing
   residential buildings, subjected to negative impacts of the industrial
   environment induced by coal mining plants during their whole technical
   life cycle. The research was justified on the grounds of safety of use,
   as well as potential energy losses and CO2 emissions generated by the
   inefficient management of building materials resources resulting from
   poor planning of retrofitting. In this field, the research is in line
   with the global trends of large-scale retrofitting of existing buildings
   in European countries due to their thermal insulation parameters and
   seismic hazard. By combining this with the effects of material
   degradation throughout the technical lifecycle of buildings, the
   proposed methods allow for a more efficient approach to maintaining
   quality management of large groups of buildings, which is part of the
   sustainable development framework. Due to the multidimensionality of the
   undertaken problem and the necessity of mathematical representation of
   uncertainty, it was decided to implement a machine learning approach.
   The effectiveness of the following methods was analysed: probabilistic
   neural network, support vector machine, naive Bayes classification and
   Bayesian belief networks. The complexity of individual methods dictated
   the order of the adopted research horizon. Within such a research plan,
   both model parameters were learned, and model structure was extracted
   from the data, which was applied only to the approach based on Bayesian
   networks. The results of the conducted analyses were verified by
   assuming classification accuracy measures. Thus, a method was extracted
   that allows for the best realisation of the set research objective,
   which was to create a classification system to assess the intensity of
   damage to masonry buildings. The paper also presents in detail the
   characteristics of the described buildings, which were used as input
   variables, and assesses the effectiveness of the obtained results in
   terms of utilisation in practice.},

Title = {Toward automated life cycle assessment for additive manufacturing: A
   systematic review of influential parameters and framework design},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {253-274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), a disruptive technology of building parts
   layer-by-layer directly from 3D models, has been considered a tempting
   cleaner production process compared to other conventional production
   routes. This is because AM has demonstrated impressive green
   characteristics which contributed to significantly reduced material and
   energy consumptions, a shorter supply chain, and diversion of the waste
   stream by reparation, etc. The majority of the current quantitative
   studies on the environmental assessment of AM are based on utilizing the
   knowledge-intensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Further,
   current studies on assessing the environmental performance of AM are
   based on a limited selection of design- or process-related parameters.
   These knowledge barriers may cause delays and challenges in the
   selection of the optimal design and process parameters for additively
   manufactured parts. Such challenges are particularly prevalent during
   the product design and planning stages due to the iterative
   design-evaluation process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated
   LCA tool to support AM toward elevated sustainability. As such, this
   paper provides three main contributions to the research community.
   Firstly, this is the first study to identify a comprehensive set of
   influential AM design and process parameters that pose an impact on the
   environmental performance of AM. Secondly, this review also summarizes
   the impacts of each of these parameters on the environmental
   sustainability of AM. Lastly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no
   work in the literature has been reported on automating LCA for AM. Thus,
   this paper promotes research toward a more environmentally benign and
   innovative AM technology by proposing a new framework to automate the
   environmental assessment of the process. The proposed framework is
   anticipated to take advantage of the fruitful integration between
   Machine Learning (ML) and the product process co-design concept to
   mitigate the challenges and limitations associated with the current
   LCA-based assessment tools.},

Abstract = {This study underscores the pressing need to accelerate the energy
   transition in existing housing to meet the EU's decarbonization targets.
   It examines the correlation between thermophysical, technical, and
   environmental properties of thermal insulation materials and their
   commercial prices in Greece. Utilizing a dataset of 500 products from
   technical leaflets, Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), and
   market surveys, the study developed six prediction models for material
   retail prices. A novel aspect of this research lies in quantifying the
   economic ramifications of insulation material properties through
   supervised machine learning (ML) techniques. Accurate price prediction
   models can provide practical applications across stakeholders, including
   cost estimations for designers, customized recommendations for
   homeowners, pricing tools for traders, optimization of manufacturing
   processes, support for policymaking, educational resources for
   construction professionals, and improved energy efficiency certification
   payback estimations. Feature analysis showed that total Global Warming
   Potential (GWP) significantly influences material prices. The Ensemble
   of Trees and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models demonstrated
   robust performance, with high R2 values of 0.95 in validation and 0.95/
   0.93 in test sets, indicating reliability without overfitting.
   Recommendations include integrating more predictors, collaborative model
   approaches, regular updates, and adopting federated learning techniques
   for enhanced data privacy and stakeholder cooperation.},

Title = {What lies ahead? The future performance of Global South residential
   buildings amid climate change: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {More than a billion people globally lack affordable and safe housing,
   with the majority located in the Global South (GS). In these regions,
   climate change will persistently impact living conditions, reducing
   thermal comfort and escalating energy consumption. Within this context,
   this investigation conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the
   use of building performance simulation (BPS) tools for climate
   adaptation and mitigation through future weather file predictions. By
   analyzing 47 documents, the study offers suggestions for policymakers
   and highlights areas that require further research. From policymakers'
   perspective, standardized metrics can promote better industry
   understanding and be key indicators for investment funds support
   climate-resilient developments. Public policies should mitigate
   overheating risks by moving beyond one-size-fits-all social housing
   approaches and implement nationwide tools for robust building design.
   Moreover, real progress in resilience relies on integrating enhanced
   building design standards with occupant behavior. From an academic
   perspective, future research should conduct national-level assessments
   of diverse urban architectural typologies, incorporating new resilience
   metrics and combining Global and Regional Climate Models to develop
   ensemble future weather files. New studies should adopt optimization,
   machine learning, and transfer learning techniques while effectively
   exploring trade-off procedures. Additionally, Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) are indispensable tools for
   advancing decarbonization efforts and evaluating technology feasibility
   in the built environment. Lastly, this SLR synthesizes past scientific
   achievements and current research gaps, providing an understanding of
   resilience modeling for climate adaptation and mitigation while offering
   a practical guide for sustainable residential buildings in the GS.},

Abstract = {The building design process incorporates various analysis activities for
   design space exploration. The need of sustainable built-facility has
   made energy efficiency an important factor through building life-cycle.
   Building information modelling (BIM) facilitates energy analysis by
   reducing re-modelling efforts to create energy model. However, the lack
   of information makes energy prediction a challenging task in the early
   design phase with a deterministic approach. The research work analyses
   various information exchange scenarios at different levels of detail
   (LOD) that link to an approach of machine learning energy prediction
   model with BIM data. At any level of detail, information is
   distinguished by the labels ``available{''}, ``developing{''} and
   ``unknown{''}. Monte Carlo method will be used to generate samples of
   energy analysis for unknown information. The uncertainty of energy
   prediction is represented by mean, maximum and minimum values of heating
   load. The research will be useful for design space exploration at the
   early stage of design.},

Title = {Assessing Factors Affecting Fall Accidents among Hispanic Construction
   Workers: Integrating Safety Insights into BIM for Enhanced Life Cycle
   Management},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Falls are the most common type of accident in the construction industry,
   and falls to a lower level are among the leading causes of fatalities.
   Work-related fatalities due to falls, slips, and trips have been
   increasing, with Hispanic workers among the highest fatalities. This
   study investigated the association between fall accidents and attributes
   such as age, musculoskeletal pain (MSPs), sleep hours, safety knowledge,
   use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and working hours among
   Hispanic construction workers involved in building construction. This
   study collected 220 valid responses and used nonparametric chi-square
   tests and binary logistic regression to analyze the data. This study
   found that the location of the fall, MSPs, and use of personal
   protective equipment have a significant effect on the likelihood of
   having fall accidents. The strongest predictor of fall accidents was
   ``fall from a ladder{''}, followed by having two or three MSPs. The use
   of PPE had the highest decreasing ratio in odds of fall accidents,
   indicating the importance of wearing PPE properly. The results show the
   importance of integrating safety management strategies within
   construction projects' broader life cycle management. The insights list
   how project engineers can incorporate these findings into Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) systems to enhance project planning and
   safety measures in reducing fall-related accidents and their severe
   consequences. This study highlights the importance of addressing MSPs,
   properly using PPE, and reducing falls from ladders in the construction
   industry to prevent fall accidents among Hispanic workers and minimize
   their severe consequences.},

Title = {A random forest-based model for the prediction of construction-stage
   carbon emissions at the early design stage},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {328},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a major greenhouse gas that causes
   global warming. Many researchers in the fields of architecture,
   engineering, and construction try to measured CO2 emissions during a
   building's lifecycle. However, research on the CO2 emissions during
   construction stage are less studied than those during other stages
   because they are considered to be lower than the emissions from the
   building's materials' production or operational stage. In addition,
   research has been hindered by a complicated calculation process and a
   lack of data, and thus few methods are available for forecasting
   construction-stage carbon emissions, especially at the early design
   stage. In order to estimate the environmental effects of the emissions
   from the vast number of construction activities, this study applies a
   random forest (RF) based predictive method to predict construction-stage
   carbon emissions. The RF-based model uses data from 38 buildings in the
   Pearl River Delta region of China for the initial training set to find
   the relation between construction-stage carbon emissions and design
   parameters. Compared with the multilinear regression method, the
   RF-based model has a higher coefficient of determination and lower mean
   square error. The model developed in this study facilitates the
   prediction of construction-stage carbon emissions at the early design
   stage of a building. This opens up novel opportunities to reduce carbon
   emissions from buildings, which had previously been possible only at the
   latter stages of a building's life cycle. It will also help policymakers
   account for the probable distribution and amount of CO2 emissions in a
   city when multiple construction projects are proceeding simultaneously,
   so that measures can be implemented to avoid excessive emissions.},

Abstract = {Promotions and shorter life cycles make grocery sales forecasting more
   difficult, requiring more complicated models. We identify methods of
   increasing complexity and data preparation cost yielding increasing
   improvements in forecasting accuracy, by varying the forecasting
   technique, the input features and model scope on an extensive SKU-store
   level sales and promotion time series from a European grocery retailer.
   At the high end of data and technique complexity, we propose using
   regression trees with explicit features constructed from sales and
   promotion time series of the focal and related SKU-store combinations.
   We observe that data pooling almost always improves model performance.
   The results indicate that simple time series techniques perform very
   well for periods without promotions. However, for periods with
   promotions, regression trees with explicit features improve accuracy
   substantially. More sophisticated input is only beneficial when advanced
   techniques are used. We believe that our approach and findings shed
   light into certain questions that arise while building a grocery sales
   forecasting system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Propriety assessment model for life cycle operational global warming
   potential of apartment buildings in Korea using energy efficiency and

Abstract = {In response to global warming, researchers worldwide are actively
   investigating various techniques and institutional frameworks to reduce
   the emission of greenhouse gases. Despite numerous life cycle assessment
   (LCA) studies indicating that global warming effects due to lifetime
   energy consumption are the greatest in the building operation stage, the
   absence of a standard global warming potential (GWP) report based on
   building energy usage makes it difficult to examine realistic GWP
   reduction directions. In South Korea, energy data for numerous buildings
   were collected through the Building Energy Efficiency Certification
   (BEEC) for several years, with data from apartment buildings receiving
   the most attention. GWP emissions were evaluated using the data through
   Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design LCA. Here, we
   developed a model for apartment buildings to assess mutual propriety for
   GWP emissions (E) and energy effective area ratio (R-E) during building
   operation to support the reduction of GWP emissions caused by lifetime
   operational energy consumption resulting from planning and design. We
   collected apartment BEEC data and used them to calculate the energy
   effective area ratio and GWP emissions of each building, which were then
   classified by energy use and source. Linear regression analysis was
   performed between R-E and E for each classification, and the derived
   regression equation was developed as a GWP assessment model for
   apartments. The applicability of the proposed model was examined through
   a case study, which confirmed that the model can be used to determine
   design directions for reducing GWP emissions for every energy in
   apartments.},

Abstract = {Building and maintaining production-grade ML-enabled components is a
   complex endeavor that goes beyond the current approach of academic
   education, focused on the optimization of ML model performance in the
   lab. In this paper, we present a project-based learning approach to
   teaching MLOps, focused on the demonstration and experience with
   emerging practices and tools to automatize the construction of
   ML-enabled components. We examine the design of a course based on this
   approach, including laboratory sessions that cover the end-to-end ML
   component life cycle, from model building to production deployment.
   Moreover, we report on preliminary results from the first edition of the
   course. During the present year, an updated version of the same course
   is being delivered in two independent universities; the related learning
   outcomes will be evaluated to analyze the effectiveness of project-based
   learning for this specific subject.},

   Our framework is comprised of both a workflow and documentation and aims
   to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results
   across the entire data science life cycle. Moreover, we propose the PDR
   desiderata for interpretable machine learning as part of veridical data
   science (with PDR standing for predictive accuracy, predictive accuracy
   and relevancy to a human audience and a particular domain problem).
   The PCS framework will be illustrated through the development of the
   DeepTune framework for characterizing V4 neurons. DeepTune builds
   predictive models using DNNs and ridge regression and applies the
   stability principle to obtain stable interpretations of 18 predictive
   models. Finally, a general DNN interpretaion method based on contexual
   decomposition (CD) will be discussed with applications to sentiment
   analysis and cosmological parameter estimation.},

Abstract = {Demographic interest in population and environment has grown in recent
   decades. One of the most prominent research areas in this tradition
   addresses the impact of population on land use and land cover change.
   Building on this tradition, we examine the effects of household
   demographic composition on land use and land cover on small farms in two
   study areas in the Brazilian Amazon. Fixed effects regression models of
   used area and forested area show few consistent effects of changes in
   household demography on land use and land cover change. Effects are
   inconsistent with the household life cycle model that currently
   dominates the literature on household demographic effects in frontiers.
   Changes in the number of children and women, particularly young women,
   have the most significant effects on land use and land cover change. We
   conclude by arguing that households strategically access cash for
   investment in agriculture and that specific strategies are determined by
   economic and institutional context.},

Title = {Multi objective optimization of recycled aggregate concrete based on
   explainable machine learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {445},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) has received extensive attention as a
   green building material. However, the service performance and
   sustainable potential of RAC have not been fully evaluated by
   traditional models due to the multi -component coupling mechanism. This
   study proposed a procedure to optimize the mixture of RAC using machine
   learning (ML) and multi -objective optimization (MOO) model, which
   enhances the compressive strength and chloride ion resistance of RAC
   while minimizing the effect on environmental impact (EI) and life cycle
   costs (LCC). A database containing 807 experimental samples was
   established to compare the prediction performance of ML models and swarm
   intelligence (SI) algorithms. WOA-BPNN has the highest prediction
   accuracy in predicting RAC compressive strength and electric charge
   passed, with R2 are 0.9904 and 0.9837 on testing set, respectively. The
   analysis of the feature importance by SHapley Additive explanation
   (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP) indicates that cement, water
   and curing age are the key parameters affecting the compressive strength
   and electric charge passed. The MOO model established by setting
   constraints and objective functions can effectively evaluate the
   trade-offs between compressive strength, electric charge passed, EI and
   LCC, and all pareto solution sets for bi-objective and tetra -objective
   provide the optimal mixture scheme. Fly ash is the best supplementary
   cementitious materials (SCMs), as it can enhance the compressive
   strength and chloride ion resistance of RAC without increasing EI and
   LCC. The proposed optimization procedure can improve the efficiency of
   RAC mixture proportion considering mechanical, durability, EI and LCC.},

Journal = {PROPERTY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {613-626},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Purpose The aim of the research is to examine the role of property tax
   in land and building administration and to develop a dynamic model. The
   paper investigates the extent to which local governments take advantage
   of property tax in generating revenue and encouraging certain life cycle
   assessment-oriented land and building speculation patterns in
   Shashemene, Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach The study was
   conducted using case study and survey research strategies. Shashemene's
   administrative area (i.e. specific to four peri-urban villages) was
   purposively selected as the case study area. A combination of different
   data collection instruments was employed: questionnaires and field
   observation. Moreover, an extensive survey of owners of undeveloped land
   and building, throughout the study area, was conducted. Multiple
   regression analysis was applied to the analyzed data as well as the use
   of dynamic modeling of land and building via qualitative and numerical
   analysis of property. Findings Results indicate that speculators will
   hold land and building for a marginal period only if the difference
   between present net rates of return exceeds the difference between
   discounted expected percent return. Practical implications This paper
   provides a simple model to recognize the optimum length of time to hold
   a parcel of land and building from the market by land speculators.
   Originality/value The introduction and potential implementation of
   dynamics modeling to the local government calls for controlling
   speculation that has resulted in local revenue enhancement.},

   for early stage prediction},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {257},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Observations made in architecture and engineering practices have
   highlighted the need to access buildings embodied greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions at early stages as well as a general understanding of the of
   design decisions. This research addresses this need, and lack of readily
   available methods by leveraging knowledge from existing building's
   databases, and using contextual and descriptive data, such as structure
   typology and location, to quantify the total embodied GHG emissions. It
   uses machine learning to a methodology for early and hands-on
   approximation of embodied GHG emissions, allowing to compare buildings,
   explain feature impacts, and verify computed results. The methodology,
   tested on the Embodied Carbon of European Buildings database, is generic
   and can be trained on other building databases and predictions tailored
   to their content. Alongside direct applications for design and decision
   -making, it provides a systematic analysis of features and emission
   standards, which, applied to a national database, could inform policy
   models and mitigation strategies and transition towards a low emission
   and sustainable environment.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a framework of automatic generation of industrial
   digital twins. These digital twins will be suitable to support
   preliminary design phases of systems development, but also to support
   next phases of detailed designs implementation and systems running
   phases. These digital twin allow, from the preliminary designing phase,
   to generate a complete simulation of the target industrial system. But,
   at the same time, and without the need to develop and add any subsequent
   code, they should be a valuable support for the phases and tasks of
   exploitation: maintenance, machine or system learning, etc. The problem
   is that the requirements for first development phases are much more
   generic than those for later phases. For this reason, instead of
   incorporating specificities in the simulation system, the framework
   takes advantage of the applications which are being developed for the
   implementation of the real system. In these applications (the control
   program and the decisions and the high level management system), the
   specificities have had to be taken into account. The system has been
   specialized in industrial transportation and warehouse systems which,
   although have a finite number or building objects, they have an infinite
   set of final configurations, very different one from each other. The
   paper presents an evaluation of current simulation platforms suitable to
   be used as part of the framework, and the digital twin industrial system
   generation framework itself. An example of application is as well
   presented. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {The White Paper on Peak Carbon and Carbon Neutral Action 2022 states
   that China is to achieve peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by
   2060. Based on the ``3060 dual-carbon{''} goal, how to improve the
   efficiency of energy performance is an important prerequisite for
   building a low-carbon, energy-saving, green, and beautiful China. The
   office performance building studied in this paper is located in the
   urban area of Turpan, where the climate is characterized by an extremely
   hot summer environment and a cold winter environment. At the same time,
   the building is oriented east-west, with the main fa \& ccedil;ade
   facing west, and the main fa \& ccedil;ade consists of a large area of
   single-layer glass curtain wall, which is affected by western sunlight.
   As a result, there are serious problems with the building's energy
   consumption, which in turn leads to excessive carbon emissions and high
   life cycle costs for the building. To address the above problems, this
   paper analyzes and optimizes the following four dimensions. First, the
   article creates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) prediction model
   with Total Energy Use in Buildings (TEUI), Global Warming Potential
   (GWP), and Life Cycle Costs (LCC) as the performance objectives. After
   optimization, the R2 of the three are 0.9908, 0.9869, and 0.9969,
   respectively, thus solving the problem of low accuracy of traditional
   prediction models. Next, the NSGA-II algorithm is used to optimize the
   three performance objectives, which are reduced by 41.94\%, 40.61\%, and
   31.29\%, respectively. Then, in the program decision stage, this paper
   uses two empowered Topsis methods to optimize this building performance
   problem. Finally, the article analyzes the variables using two
   sensitivity analysis methods. Through the above research, this paper
   provides a framework of optimization ideas for office buildings in
   extremely hot and cold regions while focusing on the four major aspects
   of machine learning, multi-objective optimization, decision analysis,
   and sensitivity analysis systematically and completely. For the
   development of office buildings in the region, whether in the early
   program design or in the later stages, energy-saving measures to
   optimize the design have laid the foundation of important guidelines.},

Title = {Practical issues in implementing machine-learning models for building
   energy efficiency: Moving beyond obstacles},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Implementing machine-learning models in real applications is crucial to
   achieving intelligent building control and high energy efficiency. Over
   the past few decades, numerous studies have attempted to explore the
   application of machine-learning models to building energy efficiency.
   However, these studies have focused on analyzing the technical
   feasibility and superiority of machine learning algorithms for fitting
   building energyrelated data and have not considered methods of
   implementing machine learning technology in building energy efficiency
   applications. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the current
   practical issues involved in applying machine-learning models to
   building energy efficiency by systematically analyzing existing research
   findings and limitations. The paper first reviews the application status
   of machine learning-based building energy efficiency research by
   analyzing the model implementation process and summarizing the main uses
   of the technology in the overall building energy management life cycle.
   The paper then elaborates on the causes of, influences on, and potential
   solutions for practical issues found in the implementation and promotion
   of machine learning-based building energy efficiency measures. Finally,
   this paper discusses valuable future machine learning-based building
   energy efficiency research directions with regard to technology
   opportunity discovery, data governance, feature engineering,
   generalizability test, technology diffusion, and knowledge sharing. This
   paper will provide building researchers and practitioners with a better
   understanding of the current application statuses of and potential
   research directions for machine learning models in building energy
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {Management and maintenance of existing buildings remains a major problem
   due to the lack of existing three-dimensional (3D) models and accurate
   as-built representation. In this paper the authors propose to use 3D
   scanner technology to capture the as-built and existing conditions of
   the buildings combined with building information modeling (BIM) as the
   underlying technology, which is a 3D semantic representation of all the
   life cycle phases of a building. This paper presents the results from
   creating as-built BIM models of existing buildings, using point cloud (a
   set of points in 3D space) and machine learning as an intermediate
   medium. Machine learning methodologies are used to speed up the
   computation of segmentation and classification of point clouds from a 3D
   virtual indoor environment using procedural modeling, which focused on
   two attributes, point density and the level of random errors. In this
   paper we will present findings on the evaluation of the performance of
   machine learning segmentation and classification algorithm based on the
   comparison of ten different point cloud data sets. Different sets of
   segmentation and classification models with comparison between models
   and within themselves were provided, which included the mean loss and
   accuracy between models with different point density.},

Title = {Direct Prediction of Bioaccumulation of Organic Contaminants in Plant

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {55},
Number = {24},

Abstract = {Root concentration factor (RCF) is an important characterization
   parameter to describe accumulation of organic contaminants in plants
   from soils in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and phytoremediation
   potential assessment. However, building robust predictive models remains
   challenging due to the complex interactions among chemical-soil-plant
   root systems. Here we developed end-to-end machine learning models to
   devolve the complex molecular structure relationship with RCF by
   training on a unified RCF data set with 341 data points covering 72
   chemicals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed gradient boosting
   regression tree (GBRT) model based on the extended connectivity
   fingerprints (ECFP) by predicting RCF values and achieved prediction
   performance with R-squared of 0.77 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.22
   using 5-fold cross validation. In addition, our results reveal nonlinear
   relationships among properties of chemical, soil, and plant. Further
   in-depth analyses identify the key chemical topological substructures
   (e.g., -O, -Cl, aromatic rings and large conjugated pi-systems) related
   to RCF. Stemming from its simplicity and universality, the GBRT-ECFP
   model provides a valuable tool for LCIA and other environmental
   assessments to better characterize chemical risks to human health and
   ecosystems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Most building energy simulations utilize typical meteorological year
   data, overlooking the impacts of climate change. This can lead to
   inaccurate predictions and suboptimal designs. This study develops an
   optimization framework to identify robust building designs under varying
   climate scenarios. A case study is presented for residential buildings
   in Huangshan, China under 2020, 2050 and 2020-2050 conditions. A general
   circulation model provides future weather data. Multi-objective
   optimization maximizes energy efficiency and minimizes life cycle costs.
   Machine learning models predict heating, cooling and cost as functions
   of envelope parameters. Optimization is performed using a genetic
   algorithm. Results reveal the optimum insulation thickness, wall
   properties and window specifications. Compared to 2020 data, the ideal
   roof insulation increases from 40 mm to 90 mm by 2050. The optimal
   heating transmittance decreases from 0.38 W/m2K to 0.19 W/m2K. The
   approach highlights the significant influence of evolving climate on
   building design. It provides architects with accurate projections to
   make informed design decisions for energy efficiency and cost savings
   over the building lifespan.},

Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate risk based design of deep urban
   excavations, considering three case reports. Random Sets (RS)
   reliability analysis combined with finite element methods are deployed
   to consider the variability of ground parameters and to obtain the
   envelopes of probability of deformation for excavation walls. These
   envelopes are used to estimate the probability of deformation in
   surrounding buildings and infrastructures. Then, loss estimation is
   performed based on deformation probability. Finally, different design
   approaches including (i) Life Cycle Cost (LCC), (ii) acceptable risk and
   (iii) conventional method are compared together for three projects.
   Results show that conventional methods may not lead to the best suited
   design and the transition from conventional to risk based design in the
   context of deep excavations is an important necessity. The LCC method is
   evaluated in some real projects and it is shown that LCC is an efficient
   tool for risk based design of deep urban excavations.},

Abstract = {Recently, smart system integration was identified as a key competence
   for optimizing machines and robots. However, when one wants to `tune'
   the entire production process a step further is necessary. We should
   evaluate performance indicators (e.g. energy and material consumption)
   over the whole machine life cycle in order to align the production with
   circular economy principles. To reach that target MBSE (model-based
   system engineering) should be covered by advanced digital twin
   approaches which allow continuous monitoring of machine performance,
   predict the failures and maintenance. Moreover, artificial intelligence
   and machine learning must be used to process big data sets gathered from
   the production lines. This paper identifies a common set of technologies
   and building blocks suitable to solve above mentioned problems for a
   large variety of industrial domains (semiconductor production,
   health-care robotics, CNC1 machining, high-speed packaging and others).
   It presents the first results of the large-scale IMOCO4.E-2 project and
   shows the pathways for application of the technology on specific
   machines (so-called pilots). The authors believe the ideas presented
   could be inspiring also in other domains.},

Title = {A Review of Building Carbon Emission Accounting and Prediction Models},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As an industry that consumes a quarter of social energy and emits a
   third of greenhouse gases, the construction industry has an important
   responsibility to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Based on
   Web of Science, Science-Direct, and CNKI, the accounting and prediction
   models of carbon emissions from buildings are reviewed. The carbon
   emission factor method, mass balance method, and actual measurement
   method are analyzed. The top-down and bottom-up carbon emission
   accounting models and their subdivision models are introduced and
   analyzed. Individual building carbon emission assessments generally
   adopt a bottom-up physical model, while urban carbon emission
   assessments generally adopt a top-down economic input-output model. Most
   of the current studies on building carbon emission prediction models
   follow the path of ``exploring influencing factors then putting forward
   prediction models based on influencing factors{''}. The studies on
   driving factors of carbon emission mainly use the Stochastic Impacts by
   Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, the
   Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model, the grey correlation degree
   model, and other models. The prediction model is realized by the
   regression model, the system dynamics model, and other mathematical
   models, as well as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and other machine learning models.
   At present, the research on carbon emission models of individual
   buildings mainly focuses on the prediction of operational energy
   consumption, and the research models for the other stages should become
   a focus in future research.},

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},

Abstract = {Large residential solar photovoltaic (PV) penetration has a compound
   effect on the grid load reductions, PV hosts' economic savings, and the
   achievable environmental benefits, which is not fully understood. This
   study combines process-based energy balance modeling, life cycle
   assessment, regression analysis, and stochastic demand simulations to
   assess the technical, economic, and environmental tradeoffs under
   increased residential solar PV adoption, using Boston, MA as a testbed.
   It was found that increased PV adoption may lead to a steeper ramp-up in
   the grid during winter months, but a flattened peak load curve during
   summer months, emphasizing the need for seasonal time-of-use rates and
   energy storage. It also reduces electricity wholesale prices, lowering
   PV hosts' economic benefits by about \$15 million under 100 \% adoption.
   The largest buildings present the highest load reduction (top 5.5 \%)
   and environmental benefits (top 16.6 \%), but they are the least cost
   efficient (top 14.5 \%), requiring tradeoff balance.},

Year = {2024},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {This research delves into the intricate dynamics of energy consumption
   in buildings, using data-driven modeling with machine learning (ML)
   algorithms to optimize design choices for heightened energy efficiency.
   A substantial dataset, comprising 66,800 operational energy records from
   office buildings in 40 cities worldwide representing 10 distinct climate
   conditions, was analyzed using four ML algorithms: Random Forest
   Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and
   eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBR). Notably, the developed GBR
   and XGBR models demonstrated superior precision in predicting energy use
   intensity during the testing phase, achieving a mean absolute percentage
   error of less than 1.2 \% and a coefficient of determination of more
   than 0.99. The findings highlighted the significant impact of building
   shape and temperature on annual operational energy consumption,
   providing valuable insights for energy-efficient design optimization.
   Finally, the grey wolf optimizer was applied to identify optimal design
   parameters for various scenarios, laying the groundwork for designing
   energy-efficient buildings in cities with diverse meteorological
   patterns.},

Title = {Supporting Decision Making for Building Decarbonization: Developing
   Surrogate Models for Multi-Criteria Building Retrofitting Analysis},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Decarbonizing buildings is crucial in addressing pressing climate change
   issues. Buildings significantly contribute to global greenhouse gas
   emissions, and reducing their carbon footprint is essential to achieving
   sustainable and low-carbon cities. Retrofitting buildings to become more
   energy efficient constitutes a solution. However, building energy
   retrofits are complex processes that require a significant number of
   simulations to investigate the possible options, which limits
   comprehensive investigations that become infeasible to carry out.
   Surrogate models can be vital in addressing computational inefficiencies
   by emulating physics-based models and predicting building performance.
   However, there is a limited focus on investigating feature engineering
   and selection methods and their effect on the model's performance and
   optimization. Feature selection methods are considered effective with
   interpretable models such as multi-variate linear regression (MVLR) and
   multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) for achieving stable
   prediction stability. This study proposes a modelling framework to
   create, optimize, and improve the performance of surrogate predictive
   models for energy consumption, carbon emissions, and the associated cost
   of building energy retrofit processes. The investigated feature
   selection methods are wrapper and embedded methods such as
   backward-stepwise feature selection (BSFS), recursive feature
   elimination (RFE), and Elastic Net embedded regularization in order to
   provide insights into the model's behavior and optimize the model's
   performance. The most accurate surrogate models developed achieved a
   mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.2-1.8\% compared to the used
   test data. In addition, when calculated for a million samples, all
   developed surrogate models reduced the computational time by
   one-thousand-fold compared to physics-based models. The study's findings
   pave the way towards low-computational accurate models that can
   comprehensively predict building performance in near real-time,
   ultimately leading to identifying decarbonization measures at scale.},

Title = {Analysis of the underlying factors affecting BIM-LCA integration in the
   Ghanaian construction industry: a factor analysis approach},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThe integration of building information modelling (BIM) and life
   cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective means of achieving sustainability
   in the built environment. However, research remains scant on BIM-LCA
   integration in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI). This study aims
   to evaluate the barriers to BIM-LCA integration in the GCI from the
   perspective of construction
   professionals.Design/methodology/approachEpistemologically relevant
   theory was developed using interpretivism and post-positivist principles
   and tested using primary quantitative data. Firstly, a comprehensive
   literature review identified and examined BIM-LCA integration barriers.
   Structured surveys of 216 Ghanaian construction professionals collected
   data on BIM-LCA integration barriers. Data was then analysed using
   exploratory factor analysis.FindingsFindings revealed three clusters of
   barriers, namely, organisational barriers; technical complexity; and
   knowledge and education. These findings identify and recommend solutions
   to BIM-LCA integration barriers to standardise processes, raise
   awareness and integrate project management systems. BIM-LCA adoption
   will increase productivity, sustainability, construction sector
   employment (and skills development) and economic growth. This paper
   concludes with future research on how artificial intelligence and
   machine learning could improve BIM-LCA integration in building designs.
   Such work would reveal how new technologies can be used to overcome
   adoption barriers and promote sustainable building.Originality/valueThis
   research provides novel knowledge on the barriers to BIM-LCA adoption in
   Ghana. Practical recommendations for overcoming these barriers are also
   proposed, e.g. developing standardised procedures and protocols,
   increasing awareness and education and integrating BIM-LCA into project
   management systems.},

Title = {Machine learning techniques for prediction of capacitance and remaining

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {438-451},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Supercapacitors are appealing energy storage devices for their promising
   features like high power den-sity, outstanding cycling stability, and a
   quick charge-discharge cycle. The exceptional life cycle and ulti-mate
   power capability of supercapacitors are needed in the transportation and
   renewable energy generation sectors. Hence, predicting the capacitance
   and lifecycle of supercapacitors is significant for selecting the
   suitable material and planning replacement intervals for
   supercapacitors. In addition, sys-tem failures can be better addressed
   by accurately forecasting the lifecycle of SCs. Recently, the use of
   machine learning for performance prediction of energy storage materials
   has drawn increasing attention from researchers globally because of its
   superiority in prediction accuracy, time efficiency, and
   cost-effectiveness. This article presents a detailed review of the
   progress and advancement of ML techniques for the prediction of
   capacitance and remaining useful life (RUL) of supercapacitors. The
   review starts with an introduction to supercapacitor materials and ML
   applications in energy storage devices, followed by workflow for ML
   model building for supercapacitor materials. Then, the summary of
   machine learning applications for the prediction of capacitance and RUL
   of different supercapacitor materials including EDLCs (carbon based
   materials), pesudocapacitive (oxides and composites) and hybrid
   materials is pre-sented. Finally, the general perspective for future
   directions is also presented.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute

Title = {A decision tree-based modeling approach for evaluating the green
   performance of airport buildings},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {100},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Airport buildings can significantly impact the environment throughout
   their life cycle. With over 40,000 existing numbers worldwide, airport
   buildings pose a serious threat that is unacknowledged either in the
   built envi-ronment or the aviation sector. This gap along with the lack
   of specific frameworks highlights the need for more airport-based
   research on green building performance assessments and the development
   of airport-specific green building rating tools (GBRT). This research
   aims to develop a decision tree-based modeling approach for eval-uating
   the green performance of airport buildings. Information from publicly
   available airport communications such as sustainability, environment,
   corporate social responsibility, and annual reports are utilized to
   create an environmental dataset with 17 environmental features.
   Structured web-mining and content analysis approaches are followed to
   build the dataset comprising 577 report information. The Classification
   and Regression Tree (CART) model is preferred for the supervised
   learning exercise due to its high-performing ability with scarce data
   and easier interpretability of its results by airport stakeholders. The
   CART model resulted in the development of 49 green rules that are of
   practical use to airport operators towards their built environment
   management relating to the environmental categories of GBRT. The
   developed CART model exhibits useful and justifiable inter-relationships
   between features that are previously unobserved in any GBRTs.},

Title = {Integrating machine learning and parametric design for energy-efficient
   building cladding systems in arid climates: Sport hall in Kerman},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Climate change, driven by fossil fuel dependence, presents a significant
   challenge for the construction industry, particularly in
   energy-intensive regions like arid climates. This research investigates
   the potential of integrating machine learning and parametric
   optimization to enhance the energy efficiency of spatial structure domes
   in such environments. Focusing on a sports pavilion in Kerman, Iran, the
   study examines the crucial role of cladding systems in building energy
   performance. Employing a rigorous four-phase methodology, the research
   optimizes dome cladding materials for hot, dry climates using a dual
   objective function: energy cost and material cost. The process involves
   a comprehensive literature review, data-driven material selection,
   advanced energy simulations, and optimization analysis. Parametric
   modeling tools (Rhino, Grasshopper, Honeybee) facilitate the comparative
   analysis of various cladding systems. Multivariate Polynomial Regression
   (MPR) enables predictive modeling of energy consumption and material
   costs, streamlining the design process for architects. The optimized
   solution is a hybrid cladding model composed of 10 \% polycarbonate and
   90 \% aluminum. Analysis reveals that the hybrid system offers superior
   energy optimization compared to pure aluminum (4.58 \%) and
   polycarbonate (5.70 \%). While polycarbonate has a lower initial
   material cost, the hybrid system achieves a balance between material
   expenditure and long-term energy efficiency. This highlights the
   importance of considering life-cycle costs when evaluating building
   envelope materials. This research advances a framework that leverages
   machine learning and parametric design for building envelope
   optimization. This framework empowers architects and engineers to create
   energy-efficient structures within arid environments, promoting a more
   sustainable built environment.},

Title = {Applications of machine learning to BIM: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows are becoming very
   relevant for the different stages of the project's lifecycle, more data
   is produced and managed across it. The information and data accumulated
   in BIMbased projects present an opportunity for analysis and extraction
   of project knowledge from the inception to the operation phase. In other
   industries, Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be an
   effective approach to automate processes and extract useful insights
   from different types and sources of data. The rapid development of ML
   applications, the growing generation of BIM-related data in projects,
   and the different needs for use of this data present serious challenges
   to adopt and effectively apply ML techniques to BIM-based projects in
   the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO)
   industry. While research on the use of BIM data through ML has increased
   in the past decade, it is still in a nascent stage. In order to asses
   where the industry stands today, this paper carries out a systematic
   literature review (SLR) identifying and summarizing common emerging
   areas of application and utilization of ML within the context of
   BIM-generated data. Moreover, the paper identifies research gaps and
   trends. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research
   directions are suggested, focusing on information architecture and data,
   applications scalability, and human information interactions.},

Title = {Factors influencing and methods of predicting greenhouse gas emissions
   from highway tunnel construction in southwestern China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {229},
Pages = {337-349},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {The rapid development of China's highway tunnels consumes great amounts
   of energy and materials and emits large volumes of greenhouse gases
   (GHGs). The design and construction of tunnels are susceptible to the
   geological environments, but few existing studies considered the roles
   of the geological environments and construction parameters in the GHG
   emissions of tunnels. To elucidate the mechanism of GHG emissions during
   the construction of highway tunnels, this study expanded the
   relationship of the geological conditions and construction parameters
   with GHG emissions. Forty-nine lining designs and geological conditions
   for eight real tunnels in southwestern China were studied. The
   life-cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to calculate the emissions
   from 49 tunnels, which ranged from 5.08 x 10(3) t to 52.63 x 10(3) t
   CO(2)eq. Relevant analyses were conducted to identify the key indicators
   affecting tunnel construction emissions. The influencing factors,
   according to the correlation with GHG emissions from high to low, are
   the total mass of materials, excavation area, excavation method, rock
   mass grade, and buried depth. Another finding was that excavation
   methods are significantly correlated with the rock mass grades. For the
   first time, two linear regression models for GHG emissions from tunnel
   construction were established. The excavation area and the rock mass
   grades can predict the approximate GHG emissions during tunnel
   construction, while the total mass of materials is a better predicting
   variable when the material input data are available. (C) 2019 Elsevier

   Rights},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {This paper integrates the scholarship on compliance with international
   human rights courts to reflect upon how the literature approaches delays
   and compliance cycles. Building on this review, we propose a new
   analytical approach that helps distinguish between reparations prone to
   immediate or protracted implementation. We introduce two metrics to
   facilitate the interpretation of delays: the yearly probability of
   compliance and the expected time to compliance. We also show, using
   machine-learning tools, how scholars can reconstruct life cycles of
   compliance. The article illustrates the utility of this approach with an
   analysis of all cases decided by the Inter-American Court of Human
   Rights (IACtHR) between 1989 and 2019. This analytical framework
   provides critical insights for courts and activists seeking to promote
   interventions at key moments when compliance is most likely. Moreover,
   the study underscores important lessons for the Inter-American Human
   Rights System. Current concerns about a compliance ``crisis{''} at the
   IACtHR partly reflect a failure to distinguish between reparation types
   and the Court's preference for reparations requiring protracted
   implementation. By modeling compliance life cycles, our study opens a
   promising research avenue that can facilitate effectual and timely
   policy intervention.},

Title = {Data-driven prediction of natural period for existing RC high-rise
   buildings using probabilistic machine learning methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The natural period of existing reinforced concrete (RC) high-rise
   buildings is a fundamental structural parameter for dynamic analysis and
   condition assessment, while the estimation of such structural
   characteristic is an important task for life -cycle maintenance. A
   commonly adopted approach for predicting natural periods involves the
   use of design -oriented empirical formulas. However, as shown by real
   -world observations in both this study and others, these formulas with
   limited building features may not fully capture the complexity and
   uncertainty of the natural period for existing buildings. Therefore, it
   is desired to develop an alternative method that is both feature -based
   and data -driven, to predict natural periods accurately. This study
   proposes a feature -based probabilistic machine learning method to
   determine the natural periods and quantify the uncertainty intervals of
   the predictions for existing RC high-rise buildings. Specifically, the
   proposed method comprises a random -forest method using quantile
   regression. Through in situ measurements and an extensive literature
   review, a database comprising over 500 actual records was constructed,
   including the building features and their dynamic properties. The
   results show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of
   determination of 0.96 and an uncertainty interval confined within 20 \%
   for the test set. These findings indicate that the proposed method may
   be both more accurate and reliable. Furthermore, an in-depth
   investigation into the model interpretability was conducted to reveal
   the relative importance of different building features. The analyses
   indicate that the building height emerges as the most crucial feature,
   while the building width and its lateral resistant system may also
   demonstrate noticeable influence on predicting natural periods.},

Abstract = {Chatbots are intelligent software built to be used as a replacement for
   human interaction. Existing studies typically do not provide enough
   support for low-resource languages like Bangla. Due to the increasing
   popularity of social media, we can also see the rise of interactions in
   Bangla transliteration (mostly in English) among the native Bangla
   speakers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to build a Bangla
   chatbot aimed to be used as a business assistant which can communicate
   in low-resource langauage like Bangla and Bangla Transliteration in
   English with high confidence consistently. Since annotated data was not
   available for this purpose, we had to work on the whole machine learning
   life cycle (data preparation, machine learning modeling, and model
   deployment) using Rasa Open Source Framework, fastText embeddings,
   Polyglot embeddings, Flask, and other systems as building blocks. While
   working with the skewed annotated dataset, we try out different
   components and pipelines to evaluate which works best and provide
   possible reasoning behind the observed results. Finally, we present a
   pipeline for intent classification and entity extraction which achieves
   reasonable performance (accuracy: 83.02\%, precision: 80.82\%, recall:
   83.02\%, F1-score: 80\%).},

Abstract = {The Machine Learning is one of the areas of Artificial Intelligence
   whose objective is the development of computational techniques for
   knowledge and building systems able to acquire knowledge automatically.
   One of the main challenges of learning algorithms is to maximize
   generalization. Thus the board machine, or a combination of more of a
   learning machine approach known in literature with the denomination
   ensemble along with the theory agents, become a promising alternative in
   this challenge. In this context, this research proposes the iEnsemble
   framework, which aims to provide a model of the ensemble through a
   multi-agent system architecture, where generalization, combination and
   learning are made through agents, through the performance of their
   respective roles. In the proposal, the agents follow each their life
   cycle and also perform the iStacking algorithm. This algorithm is based
   on Stacking method, which uses the reinforcement learning to define the
   result of the Ensemble. To validate the initial proposal of the
   framework, some experiments have been performed and the results obtained
   and limitations are presented.},

Abstract = {There are quite some machine learning (ML) models, frameworks, AI-based
   services or products from different IT solution providers available,
   which can be used as building blocks to embed and use in IT solution
   architectures of companies. However, the path from initial prototypical
   proof of concept solutions until the deployment of proven systems into
   the operational environment remains a major challenge. The potential of
   AI-based software components using ML or knowledge engineering (KE) is
   huge and the majority of small to medium enterprises are still unsure
   whether their internal developer teams should be extended by additional
   ML or KE skills to enrich their IT solution architectures with novel
   AI-based components where appropriate. How can enterprises manage the
   change and visualize the current state and foreseeable road-map? In the
   current paper, we propose an AI system landscape for the public
   transport sector, which is based on existing AI-domains and
   AI-categories defined by different technical reports of the European
   Commission. We collect use-cases from three different enterprises in the
   transportation sector and visualize them on the proposed domain specific
   AI-landscape. We provide some insights into different maturity levels of
   different AI-based components and how the different ML and KE based
   components can be embedded into an AI-based software development
   life-cycle (SDLC). We visualize, how the AI-based IT-solution
   architecture evolved over the last decades with respect to coupling and
   decoupling of layers and tiers in the overall Enterprise Architecture.},

Title = {The role of climate change and decentralization in urban water services:
   A dynamic energy-water nexus analysis},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Urban water services, including drinking water supply and wastewater
   treatment, are highly energy dependent, contributing to the challenges
   described under the water-energy nexus. Both future climate change and
   decentralized water system adoptions can potentially influence the
   energy use of the urban water services. However, the trend and the
   extent of such influences have not been well understood. In this study,
   a modeling framework was developed to quantify both the separate and the
   combined influences of climate change and decentralization on the life
   cycle energy use of the urban water cycle, using the City of Boston, MA
   as a testbed. Two types of household decentralized systems were
   considered, the greywater recycling (GWR) systems and the rainwater
   harvesting (RWH) systems. This modeling framework integrates empirical
   models based on multilinear regression analysis, hydrologic modeling,
   water balance models, and life cycle assessment to capture the complex
   interactions among centralized water services, decentralized water
   system adoptions, and climate parameters for cumulative energy demand
   (CED) assessment, considering all residential buildings in Boston. It
   was found that climate change alone will slightly increase the energy
   use of the centralized systems towards the end of the century, due to
   the cancelation effect amongst changes in water quality, flow rate, and
   space and water heating demand. When decentralization is considered
   alone, we found economically viable decentralized systems may not
   necessarily produce energy savings. In fact, RWH adoptions may increase
   energy use. When climate change and decentralization are combined, they
   will increase the water yield and cost savings of the decentralized
   systems, while reducing the energy use from the centralized systems.
   When the centralized systems are further added into the picture, the CED
   of the entire urban water cycle is projected to increase by 0.9\% or
   2.3\% towards the end of the century under climate change if GWR or RWH
   systems are adopted by respective cost saving positive buildings.},

Title = {Using LCA to research carbon footprint for precast concrete piles during
   the building construction stage: A China study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {245},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Due to the rapid development of the construction industry, large
   construction projects consume a significant amount of energy, and emit
   large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which has received
   extensive attention from the society. According to statistics, 30\% of
   the energy losses and 40\% of the solid wastes of the construction
   industry are generated during the construction phase. In addition, 40\%
   of the solid waste generated by the construction industry is generated
   during the construction phase. Therefore, it is an important large
   potential research value in the construction stage emission reduction.
   As a result, this study aims to investigate precast concrete pile
   products and their carbon footprint at the construction stage based on
   the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. Based on the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD)
   databases, a database of mechanical equipment carbon emission factors
   was compiled. The carbon footprint of precast concrete piles was divided
   into three sources: material transportation, construction equipment, and
   office area. The carbon footprint calculation model of precast concrete
   pile during the construction stage was established. Lastly, a detailed
   case study was conducted to verify the empirical findings. Pile
   foundation area, pile foundation cost, and pile foundation number were
   analyzed as independent variables, through SPSS(Statistical Product and
   Service Solutions) software for regression analysis. Based on research
   result, the carbon emissions of construction machinery reached 73\% of
   the total carbon emissions during the construction of precast concrete
   piles, and the carbon emissions of pile drivers are more than half of
   the carbon emissions of construction machinery. And there is a strong
   linear relationship between the area of pile foundation, the cost of
   pile foundation and the number of pile foundation and the total carbon
   emission during the construction of precast concrete piles.
   This study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing the carbon
   footprint calculation and establishing the trend of carbon emissions for
   precast concrete pile construction. In addition to that, the findings of
   this study can be used to improve construction management plans and
   select energy-saving technologies. The results can also provide a
   theoretical support for the formulation of regulations and emission
   reduction policies based on building energy conservation and carbon
   emission reduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adopting Artificial Intelligence for enhancing the implementation of
   systemic circularity in the construction industry: A critical review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {509-524},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Data-driven technology such as Artificial Intelligence is considered an
   essential enabler of circular economy (CE) in the building construction
   industry (BCI). As both AI and CE applications are emerging areas in the
   BCI, there exists little systematic guidance on how AI can be applied to
   capture the full potential of systemic circularity along the building
   product lifecycle. To fill this gap, this study provides an extensive
   systematic review of scien-tific research advancement in AI and CE in
   the BCI. AI algorithms for enabling systemic circularity in the BCI were
   discussed alongside their respective Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats, and
   Opportunities (SWOT) analysis con-cerning CE solutions. Further,
   thirteen application areas of the AI models were illustrated and
   summarised using a tree diagram. Among the application areas include
   circular materials selection, design for disassembly, pre-demolition
   auditing, demolition waste sorting, materials strength prediction,
   technical and economic circu-larity of materials, operation of circular
   business model, onsite waste recycling, and reverse logistics. In
   addition, the profound challenges of applying AI in enabling CE
   implementation in BCI were identified and their potential solutions were
   highlighted. A holistic framework integrating the AI models and their

Title = {Integrating embodied greenhouse gas emissions assessment into the
   structural design of tall buildings: A framework and software tool for
   design decision-making},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {297},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Urgent changes are needed in the construction industry to address the
   adverse effects of material production on the environment. The
   construction of tall buildings results in a high temporal and spatial
   concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is largely due to
   the compounding influence of wind and earthquake loads on structural
   material requirements.Thus, to meet short-term climate change mitigation
   goals, the structural design of tall buildings must consider and
   minimise the embodied GHG emissions of structural systems. This study
   aimed to develop a framework to inform the design of tall building
   structural systems in order to minimise their embodied GHG emissions. A
   software tool was developed to implement the framework and automate the
   design, analysis, and embodied GHG emissions assessment of structural
   systems for tall buildings. Approximately 1,000 building models were
   iteratively designed, analysed, and assessed using the software tool.
   Through regression analyses, the resulting dataset was used to construct
   predictive models for the embodied GHG emissions of 12 unique
   combinations of structural system typologies and materials. By applying
   the framework and software tool to a 52-storey case study building, it
   is estimated that optimising structural material choices and geometric
   design strategies could reduce the embodied GHG emissions of tall
   building structural systems by up to 20\% compared to current
   practices.The developed framework and software tool allow designers to
   use environmental assessment as a design decision-making tool, rather
   than an appraisal method for evaluating completed buildings, helping to
   reduce the environmental effects associated with tall building
   construction.},

Abstract = {It is long recognized by the industry practitioners that how well
   preproject planning is conducted has great impact on project outcome.
   Through industry project data collection and model analysis, this
   research intends to investigate the relationship between preproject
   planning and project success. In early stage of the project life cycle,
   essential project information is collected and crucial decisions are
   made. It is also tit this stage where risks associated with the project
   are analyzed and the specific project execution approach is defined. To
   assist with the early planning process, Construction Industry Institute
   (CII) has developed a scope definition tool, Project Definition Rating
   Index (PDRI) for industrial and building industry. Since its
   introduction, PDRI has been widely used by the industry and researchers
   have been using the PDRI to collect preproject planning information from
   the industry. Scope definition information as well as project
   performance are collected and used for this research analysis. This
   research summarizes preproject planning data collected from 62
   industrial projects and 78 building projects, representing approximately
   \$5 billion in total construction cost. Based on the information
   obtained, preproject planning was identified as having direct impact on
   the project success (cost and schedule performance). Two techniques were
   then used to develop models for predicting cost and schedule growth:
   statistical analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). The research
   results provide a valuable source of information for the industry
   practitioners that proves better planning in the early stage of the
   project life cycle have positive impact on the final project outcome.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {67-78},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Integrated solar absorption cooling and heating (SACH) systems, which
   use solar energy to provide space heating, space cooling, and water
   heating, represent a promising substitute to reduce the earth's carbon
   emissions. SACH systems currently are designed based on engineering
   experience for the most part and few systematic methodologies are
   available to identify the key optimal parameters for SACH systems, such
   as the slope of the solar collectors, the area of the solar collectors,
   and the volume of the storage tanks. As a result, the established
   systems usually are not capable of yielding the greatest returns on
   investment. Motivated by the above facts, this study investigates a
   formal method for SACH system optimization by incorporating
   simultaneously a system's performance related to its economic, energy,
   and environmental aspects. The proposed method includes central
   composite design, regression, and multi-objective optimization. Central
   composite design (CCD) is used to select the significant experimental
   data generated by energy system simulation and life cycle analysis.
   Linear regression models are used to predict the functional relationship
   between system performance and the key system parameters using data
   sets. A multi-objective optimization model is then formulated and solved
   based on the Weighted-Tchebycheff metric approach. The proposed approach
   is applied to medium-sized office buildings located in Phoenix, Los
   Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago; and the results suggest that the approach
   can provide a systematic mechanism to optimally design SACH systems.

Title = {Determination and Modeling of Optimum Insulation Thickness for Thermal

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {In this study, research has been carried out in which the optimum
   insulation thickness for the thermal insulation of buildings in all city
   centers of Turkey is determined according to life cycle cost analysis.
   Besides, the total annual net savings of the buildings in all city
   centers and the payback period of the insulation were concluded
   according to the determined optimum insulation thickness. In the
   calculations, it is assumed that natural gas is used for heating the
   buildings, and electrical energy is used for cooling. Besides, four
   different insulation materials (XPS, EPS, PUR, and Rock wool) were
   selected as the most preferred thermal insulation material in Turkey.
   The methods applied to determine the buildings' optimum insulation
   thickness are very time-consuming and dependent on many parameters.
   Twelve different models have been developed for all city centers that
   determine the optimum insulation thickness depending on the number of
   Degree-Days of buildings that need only heating, cooling only, heating
   and cooling to create a practical approach in determining the optimum
   insulation thickness. The regression analysis models' suitability using
   MATLAB R2019a program, with R-2 values being the main criterion, SEE
   (Standard error estimate), and RMSE (Root mean square error) values are
   considered. Accordingly, when the similarity between the developed
   models and optimal insulation thicknesses obtained from theoretical
   calculations was examined, it was determined that R-2 values were
   between 0.9683 and 0.9997. It is predicted that this study will provide
   a practical solution for researchers and designers working on this
   subject.},

Abstract = {We present a group decision making framework for evaluating
   sustainability of the insulating materials. We tested thirteen materials
   on a model that was applied to retrofit a traditional rural building
   through roof's insulation. To evaluate the materials from the
   socio-economic and environmental viewpoints, we combined life cycle
   costing and assessment with an adaptive comfort evaluation. In this way,
   the performances of each coating material were measured in terms of an
   incurred reduction of costs and consumption of resources, maintenance of
   the cultural and historic significance of buildings, and a guaranteed
   indoor thermal comfort. The comprehensive assessment of the materials
   involved their assignment to one of the three preference-ordered
   sustainability classes. For this purpose, we used a multiple criteria
   decision analysis approach that accounted for preferences of a few tens
   of rural buildings' owners. The proposed methodological framework
   incorporated an outranking-based preference model to compare the
   insulating materials with the characteristic class profiles while using
   the weights derived from the revised Simos procedure. The initial
   sorting recommendation for each material was validated against the
   outcomes of robustness analysis that combined the preferences of
   individual stakeholders either at the output or at the input level. The
   analysis revealed that the most favorable materials in terms of their
   overall sustainability were glass wool, hemp fibres, kenaf fibres,
   polystyrene foam, polyurethane, and rock wool.},

Abstract = {In order to foster a more sustainable and eco-friendly trajectory for
   the construction industry, while concurrently mitigating environmental
   pollution and energy inefficiency, it is imperative to cultivate an
   environmentally conscious building and urban environment. Under the
   background of Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality, the green building
   rating system has become a research hotspot in the field of green
   building. This paper systematically summarizes the research progress of
   the GBRS in weight setting, indicator setting, and the evaluation
   process, and creatively proposes the following three directions for
   future research: (1) Weight determination methods based on machine
   learning or deep learning models, and reasonable weight allocation by
   mixing multiple evaluation methods. (2) Setting dynamic evaluation
   indicators, strengthening interdisciplinary research and regional
   consideration, and introducing a life cycle assessment to solve the
   problem of setting indicators in the existing evaluation system. (3)
   Combine building information modeling with GBRS to realize the
   automation and intelligence of evaluation and improve the
   comprehensiveness and accuracy of evaluation.},

Abstract = {The analyzed research issue provides a model for Carbon Footprint
   estimation at an early design stage. In the context of climate
   neutrality, it is important to introduce regenerative design practices
   in the architect's design process, especially in early design phases
   when the possibility of modifying the design is usually high. The
   research method was based on separate consecutive research works-partial
   tasks: Developing regenerative design guidelines for simulation purposes
   and for parametric modeling; generating a training set and a testing set
   of building designs with calculated total Carbon Footprint; using the
   pre-generated set to train a Machine Learning Model; applying the
   Machine Learning Model to predict optimal building features; prototyping
   an application for a quick estimation of the Total Carbon Footprint in
   the case of other projects in early design phases; updating the
   prototyped application with additional features; urban layout analysis;
   preparing a new approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks and
   training the new algorithm; and developing the final version of the
   application that can predict the Total Carbon Footprint of a building
   design based on basic building features and on the urban layout. The
   results of multi-criteria analyses showed relationships between the
   parameters of buildings and the possibility of introducing Carbon
   Footprint estimation and implementing building optimization at the
   initial design stage.},

Title = {Predictive models of embodied carbon emissions in building design
   phases: Machine learning approaches based on residential buildings in
   China},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {258},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {As one of the major architectural forms, residential building
   construction consumes considerable resources, and it has been regarded
   as a crucial factor for the implementation of carbon peaking and
   neutrality targets. Estimation of carbon emissions is essential for
   making informed decisions regarding building design and carbon reduction
   measures. Some studies have established predictive models for building
   operational carbon emissions. However, there are relatively few studies
   concerning the prediction of embodied carbon emissions. This study
   established a dataset containing 850 residential building samples. Based
   on the trade-offs and combinations of different explanatory variables,
   including building features and material use, this study developed
   two-phase models. These models, incorporating six scenarios, predicted
   embodied carbon intensities using twelve machine learning algorithms.
   For the planning design phase, an extremely randomized tree model using
   the building height, structural form, seismic fortification intensity,
   delivery form, geographical region, and material cost as inputs was
   favored considering R2 as 0.821 on the testing dataset. For the
   preliminary design phase, an extreme gradient boosting model using both
   building features and material intensities provided superior performance
   with R2 and MAPE values of 0.917 and 0.038, respectively. The optimal
   models and relevant feature importance analysis can be helpful for
   efficiently predicting embodied carbon emissions, and therefore,
   facilitate low -carbon designs.},

Title = {A holistic two-stage decision-making methodology for passive and active
   building design strategies under uncertainty},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {251},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In the last decade, many studies focused on finding optimal design
   solutions considering trade-offs between different aspects of building
   design. Accordingly, multi -objective optimization (MOO) approaches have
   been increasingly applied in the building industry. However, certain
   aspects must be deepened to ensure a more effective decision -making
   process in the early planning phase. On the one hand, uncertainties
   should be considered before making decisions to ensure the robustness of
   the optimal solutions; on the other hand, decisions are made at
   different times in building planning, and the sequential order of making
   decisions should be modeled. This paper presents a holistic two -stage
   multi -objective stochastic optimization (MOSO)-II framework to minimize
   the environmental impact of global warming potential (GWP) and cost
   throughout the entire life cycle of a building (phases of A1 -A3, B4, B6
   and C3 -C4), considering passive and active design strategies in two
   consecutive stages, under uncertainty. Herein, individual/use and
   political/market uncertainties are considered. As a proof of concept,
   the proposed framework is applied in a case study for a generic zone in
   a multi -family terraced residential building type with solid brick
   construction. The advantages of the proposed framework are validated by
   comparing it with alternative single -stage MOSO frameworks. Results
   show that the proposed two -stage MOSO-II framework can deliver a
   smaller range of solutions with a better performance in terms of lower
   GWP and cost. It indicates that the proposed framework can effectively
   assist planners in decision -making by reducing the effort in choosing
   the proper solution. Secondly, the results also emphasize the importance
   of passive design strategies in sustainable building planning. In
   addition, the energy mix structure and cost of energy sources should be
   carefully adjusted in the future to promote a more ecologically
   sustainable building design.},

Abstract = {One of society's major current challenges is carbon dioxide emissions
   and their consequences. In this context, new technologies for carbon
   dioxide (CO2) capture have attracted much attention. One of these is
   carbon capture and utilization (CCU). This work focuses on the latest
   trends in a holistic approach to carbon dioxide capture and utilization.
   Absorption, adsorption, membranes, and chemical looping are considered
   for CO2 capture. Each CO2 capture technology is described, and its
   benefits and drawbacks are discussed. For the use of carbon dioxide,
   various possible applications of CCU are described, starting with the
   utilization of carbon dioxide in agriculture and proceeding to the
   conversion of CO2 into fuels (catalytic processes), chemicals
   (photocatalytic processes), polymers, and building supplies. For
   decades, carbon dioxide has been used in industrial processes, such as
   CO2-enhanced oil recovery, the food industry, organic compound
   production (such as urea), water treatment, and, therefore, the
   production of flame retardants and coolants. There also are several new
   CO2-utilization technologies at various stages of development and
   exploitation, such as electrochemical conversion to fuels, CO2-enhanced
   oil recovery, and supercritical CO2. At the end of this review, future
   opportunities are discussed regarding machine learning (ML) and life
   cycle assessment (LCA).},

Abstract = {The carbon footprint (CF) linked to electricity consumption in buildings
   has become a significant environmental issue because of its significant
   role in greenhouse gas emissions. This study seeks to assess and examine
   the CF of electricity consumption in buildings across various building
   types. Additionally, this paper aims to investigate the impact of the
   COVID-19 pandemic on the CF of buildings. The investigation involves a
   comparative analysis between the CF values observed and predicted during
   the years affected by the pandemic. Additionally, the study evaluates
   the influence of the pandemic on the accuracy of CF model predictions by
   employing three distinct machine-learning models. Spatial analyses were
   conducted to identify clustering patterns of CF and identify areas of
   both high and low CF concentrations within the study area. The findings
   demonstrate significant disparities in the CF of electricity consumption
   across distinct building types, with residential buildings emerging as
   the largest contributors to carbon emissions. Moreover, the pandemic has
   had a notable impact on CF patterns, leading to alterations in the areas
   identified as hotspots and cold spots during the pandemic years compared
   to the prepandemic period, based on building types.},

Abstract = {There has been a fundamental shift amongst software developers and
   engineers in the past few years. The software development life cycle
   (SDLC) for a developer has increased in complexity and scale. Changes
   that were developed and deployed over a matter of days or weeks are now
   deployed in a matter of hours. Due to greater availability of compute,
   storage, better tooling, and the necessity to react, developers are
   constantly looking to increase their velocity and throughput of
   developing and deploying changes. Consequently, there is a great need
   for more intelligent and context sensitive DevOps tools and services
   that help developers increase their efficiency while developing and
   debugging. Given the vast amounts of heterogeneous data available from
   the SDLC, such intelligent tools and services can now be built and
   deployed at a large scale to help developers achieve their goals and be
   more productive. In this paper, we present Sankie, a scalable and
   general service that has been developed to assist and impact all stages
   of the modern SDLC. Sankie provides all the necessary infrastructure
   (back-end and front-end bots) to ingest data from repositories and
   services, train models based on the data, and eventually perform
   decorations or provide information to engineers to help increase the
   velocity and throughput of changes, bug fixes etc. This paper discusses
   the architecture as well as some of the key observations we have made
   from wide scale deployment of Sankie within Microsoft.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 41\% of the primary energy use in the
   United States. Due to the negative environmental impact from fossil
   fuel, people are trying to use renewable energy resources to provide
   energy to the buildings. Integrated solar absorption cooling and heating
   (SACH) technology can be one of the promising solutions to this issue.
   Due to the nature of solar energy, integrated SACH has many drawbacks,
   such as discontinuity of generation, thus backup system driven by fossil
   fuel should be included to the system configuration as well. Therefore,
   optimization is highly required during the design stage.
   This paper presents the development of a method to optimize an
   integrated SACH system. Regression analysis is used to identify the
   relationship between the life cycle primary energy savings (PES) and the
   system factors according to the data provided by experiments. In order
   to obtain an accurate model to estimate the problem using small number
   of experimental trials, the method of central composite design (CCD)
   from design of experiments (DE) is used as a key technique. The
   experimental trials are conducted in TRaNsient SYstems Simulation
   (TRNSYS). Finally, the optimization problem is formulated and solved by
   including the model as the objective function and the physical
   constraints of the system factors. A case study was conducted to apply
   this optimization method to the design of an integrated SACH system
   installed in a medium-sized office building in Los Angeles.},

Abstract = {Process simulation and analyzes based on multiple evaluation indexes are
   crucial for accelerating the practical use of the post-combustion CO2
   capture process. This study presents a bi-objective optimization of the
   post -combustion CO2 absorption process using methyldiethanolamine
   (MDEA) via machine-learning and genetic al-gorithm to evaluate CO2
   emissions from the absorption process using life cycle assessment and
   cost from operating and capital expenditures. An initial dataset was
   generated by changing eight design variables, and machine-learning
   models were built using random forest classifier and Gaussian process
   regression. Pareto so-lutions were predicted using a genetic algorithm
   (NSGA-II) with the constraints of purity, recovery, and tem-perature,
   and were verified via process simulation. Verified data were added to
   the dataset, and model building, prediction, and verification were
   repeated. Eventually, 56 Pareto solutions were obtained after 11
   iterations. In the final Pareto solutions, CO2 emissions increased from
   0.56 to 0.6 t-CO2/t-CO2 with a decrease in cost from 74 to 66 USD/t-CO2.
   The trends and composition of each objective variable were examined, and
   the optimal structure of the equipment and operation conditions was
   clarified. The approach of bi-objective optimization in this study is
   promising for evaluating the CO2 capture process and individual
   processes of carbon capture, uti-lization, and storage.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A frequent and accurate quality inspection procedure to assess the
   quality requirements during the life cycle of buildings is crucial.
   Among different quality measures, the dimensional quality that involves
   spatial features of buildings is of significant importance. However, the
   traditional manual inspection of dimensional quality in buildings is
   unreliable and tedious. Thus, this study presents an end-to-end method
   for quality inspection of building structural members using point cloud
   datasets. The proposed method, first, detects and labels structural
   members within the point cloud based on a set of domain-specific
   geometric and semantic definitions. Then, each structural member's
   section width, height, and length are obtained with the proposed
   bounding box method. Experiments on three real-world buildings' point
   clouds with various geometric features and noise levels, oc-clusion, and
   outliers were also conducted, illustrating the performance efficiency
   and accuracy of the proposed model for dimensional quality inspection of
   building structural members.},

Title = {Environmental impacts cost assessment model of residential building
   using an artificial neural network},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {3190-3215},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Purpose Buildings are major contributors to greenhouse gases (GHG) along
   the various stages of the building life cycle. A range of tools have
   been utilised for estimating building energy use and environmental
   impacts; these are time-consuming and require massive data that are not
   necessarily available during early design stages. Therefore, this study
   aimed to develop an Environmental Impacts Cost Assessment Model (EICAM)
   that quantifies both energy and environmental costs for residential
   buildings. Design/methodology/approach An Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) was employed to develop the EICAM. The model consists of six input
   parameters, including wall type, roof type, glazing type, window to wall
   ratio (WWR), shading device and building orientation. In addition, the
   model calculates four measures: annual energy cost, operational carbon
   over 20 years, envelope embodied carbon and total carbon per square
   metre. The ANN architecture is 6:13:4:4, where the conjugate gradient
   algorithm was applied to train the model and minimise the mean squared
   error (MSE). Furthermore, regression analysis for the ANN prediction for
   each output was performed. Findings The MSE was minimised to 0.016 while
   training the model. Also, the correlation between each ANN output and
   the actual output was very strong, with an R-2 value for each output of
   almost 0.998. Moreover, validation was conducted for each output, with
   the error percentages calculated at 0.26\%, 0.25\%, 0.03\% and 0.27\%
   for the annual energy cost, operational carbon, envelope materials
   embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre, respectively.
   Accordingly, the EICAM contributes to enhancing design decision-making
   concerning energy consumption and carbon emissions in the early design
   stages. Research limitations/implications This study provides
   theoretical implications to the domain of building environmental impact
   assessment through illustrating a systematic approach for developing an
   energy-based prediction model that generates four environmental-oriented
   outputs, namely energy cost, operational energy carbon, envelope
   embodied carbon, and total carbon. The model developed has practical
   implications for the architectural/engineering (A/E) industries by
   providing a useful tool to easily predict environmental impact costs
   during the early design phase. This would enable designers in Saudi
   Arabia to make effective design decisions that would increase
   sustainability in the building life cycle. Originality/value By
   providing a holistic predictive model entitled EICAM, this study
   endeavours to bridge the gap between energy costs and environmental
   impacts in a predictive model for Saudi residential units. The novelty
   of this model is that it is an alternative tool that quantifies both
   energy cost, as well as building's environmental impact, in one model by
   using a machine learning approach. Besides, EICAM predicts its outcomes
   more quickly than conventional tools such as DesignBuilder and is
   reliable for predicting accurate environmental impact costs during early
   design stages.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increase in rehabilitation actions motivated further research in the
   scope of service life and/or building maintenance. In defining rational
   strategies for the buildings' maintenance, reliable tools that model
   their performance over time are needed. This research evaluates the
   impact of maintenance actions on painted renderings. More specifically,
   the objective of this research is to adapt and extend an existing
   method, evaluating new periods of service life, with and without
   maintenance actions, in order to be able to regionalize and expand the
   existing results. This research was carried out based on an extensive
   fieldwork survey of painted renderings of facades in vertical buildings
   in the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, at different times (before,
   during and after the execution of maintenance actions). For renderings
   without maintenance actions, an average service life of 14 years is
   obtained. After maintenance actions, especially cleaning, the estimated
   average service life is 16 years. After maintenance, cleaning and
   partial repair actions, the estimated average service life is 34 years.
   For painted surfaces without maintenance actions, an average service
   life of 10 years is estimated. After cleaning actions, the estimated
   average service life is 11 years. After maintenance (cleaning, partial
   repair actions on renderings and repainting), the average service life
   is 15 years, until the last period of service life that precedes the end
   of the rendering's life cycle.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Urbanization has led to rapid growth in energy consumption and CO2
   emissions in the building sector. Building operation emissions (BCEs)
   are a major part of emissions in the building life cycle. Existing
   studies have attempted to estimate fine-scale BCEs using remote sensing
   data. However, there is still a lack of research on estimating long-term
   BCEs by integrating multi-source remote sensing data and applications in
   different regions. We selected the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban
   agglomeration and the National Capital Region of Japan (NCRJ) as
   research areas for this study. We also built multiple linear regression
   (MLR) models between prefecture-level BCEs and multi-source remote
   sensing data. The prefecture-level BCEs were downscaled to grid scale at
   a 1 km(2) resolution. The estimation results verify the method's
   difference and accuracy at different development stages. The multi-scale
   BCEs showed a continuous growth trend in the BTH urban agglomeration and
   a significant downward trend in the NCRJ. The decrease in energy
   intensity and population density were the main factors contributing to
   the negative growth of BCEs, whereas GDP per capita and urban expansion
   significantly promoted it. Through our methods and analyses, we
   contribute to the study of estimating greenhouse gas emissions with
   remote sensing and exploring the environmental impact of urban growth.},

Title = {Geospatial assessment of the carbon footprint of water and electricity
   consumption in residential buildings in Doha, Qatar},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {445},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The process of estimating the carbon footprint (CF) has become a key
   method for managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, guiding strategies
   for emission reduction and validating those strategies. Given the
   complexity of quantifying total lifecycle emissions in residential
   buildings, this study delves into assessing the CF focusing on water and
   electricity consumption in two types of residential buildings: mainly
   residential villas and residential flats. This assessment was carried
   out in Doha City, Qatar, using data on water and electricity consumption
   from 2017 to 2020. The study employs the Multi-Regional Input-Output
   Life Cycle Assessment (MRIO-LCA) model to calculate and convert the
   water and electricity consumption data into the CF of these buildings.
   Further, the study employs various methods for statistical and spatial
   statistical analysis of CF emissions, including geographically weighted
   regression (GWR), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and hotspot and cold
   spot assessments. The annual electricity CF emissions from these
   buildings are approximately 7 MtCO2 equivalent, with residential villas
   contributing about 83\% of this total. Concurrently, the annual average
   water CF in residential buildings is around 0.06 MtCO2 equivalent,
   predominantly attributed to villas. The findings highlight the
   substantial impact of residential structures, particularly villas, on
   the city's overall CF emissions. Furthermore, the findings underscore
   the significant impact of residential structures, especially villas, on
   Doha's CF emissions, revealing a marked seasonal increase, particularly
   during the summer months and a notable spike in 2020. The spatial
   analysis of CF emissions reveals consistent spatial clustering patterns
   across different seasons in 2020. Elevated CF emissions from villas are
   concentrated in Doha's central, northern, and northeastern regions,
   while cold spots are predominantly in the eastern and southern areas.
   Understanding CF in residential settings is crucial for developing
   strategies to reduce emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and address
   climate change. This research helps inform targeted interventions for
   more sustainable residential energy and water use, aligning with broader
   environmental and climate goals.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify key performance indicators as well
   as the correlations among these indicators to develop a maintenance and
   repair cost estimation model for educational buildings based on actual
   payment records. The importance of financial estimation for facility
   management systems has increased. Especially, the estimation of
   maintenance and repair costs is essential to facility management for
   educational buildings considering the long-life cycle of a building.
   However, data regarding facility management is still limited. This study
   adopts payment records related to maintenance and repair work from
   educational institutions to develop a quantitative approach. Statistical
   analyses and a multiple regression analysis are conducted to examine the
   record and generate a cost estimation model. The findings and results of
   this study provide a guide for maintenance and repair cost estimation of
   integrated facility management and could be used as a guideline for
   budgeting for school maintenance.},

Title = {Machine Learning for the Improvement of Deep Renovation Building
   Projects Using As-Built BIM Models},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In recent years, new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, are
   emerging to improve decision making based on learning. Their use applied
   to the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector,
   together with the increased use of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology in all phases of a building's life cycle, is opening up a
   wide range of opportunities in the sector. At the same time, the need to
   reduce CO2 emissions in cities is focusing on the energy renovation of
   existing buildings, thus tackling one of the main causes of these
   emissions. This paper shows the potentials, constraints and viable
   solutions of the use of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence
   approaches at the design stage of deep renovation building projects
   using As-Built BIM models as input to improve the decision-making
   process towards the uptake of energy efficiency measures. First,
   existing databases on buildings pathologies have been studied. Second, a
   Machine Learning based algorithm has been designed as a prototype
   diagnosis tool. It determines the critical areas to be solved through
   deep renovation projects by analysing BIM data according to the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC4) standard and proposing the most convenient
   renovation alternative (based on a catalogue of Energy Conservation
   Measures). Finally, the proposed diagnosis tool has been applied to a
   reference test building for different locations. The comparison shows
   how significant differences appear in the results depending on the
   situation of the building and the regulatory requirements to which it
   must be subjected.},

Title = {An Integrated Artificial Intelligence Approach for Building Energy
   Demand Forecasting},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Buildings are complex assets, characterized by environments and uses
   that change over time, variable occupancies, and long life cycles. They
   have high operational costs, mostly due to their energy requirements,
   and account for 30\% to 40\% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
   Consequently, substantial effort has been made to forecast their energy
   needs, with the scope of optimizing their economic and environmental
   impact. In this regard, the available literature focuses mainly on
   short-term modeling through the implementation of sets of physics-based
   equations (i.e., white-box), functional relationships between input and
   output variables (i.e., black-box), or a combination of both (i.e.,
   grey-box). On the other hand, more research is required on long-term
   forecast models with the aim of reducing the energy needs. Within this
   context, this article presents an original automatic procedure for
   forecasting the energy needs of buildings in short- and long-term time
   horizons. This is accomplished by scaling an unknown facility from a
   similar facility that is already known and by executing a black-box
   approach based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed method is
   implemented in real case studies in Italy, predicting the energy needs
   (i.e., heating, cooling, and electricity) of Sant'Anna Hospital in
   Ferrara using the historical data of Ca' Foncello Hospital in Treviso.
   The results show an adjusted coefficient of determination above 0.7 and
   an average error below 10\% for all the energy vectors, demonstrating a
   feasible forecast performance with a low training set-to-test set ratio.},

Title = {Sustainability insights on emerging solar district heating technologies
   to boost the nearly zero energy building concept},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Volume = {180},

Abstract = {Arising the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) concept in Europe, the
   solar district heating systems (SDHS) present a potential solution to
   meet the buildings sector's European energy performance directive.
   Nevertheless, current practices face several technological and
   economical barriers to ensure service quality. In this context, our work
   presents a sustainability analysis (technical, economic, environmental,
   and social) for SDHS integration in the residential sector to meet the
   NZEB and positive energy building goals. This paper proposes an
   application of a machine learning model incorporating multi-objective
   optimization and multi-criteria decision making to facilitate a
   sustainability index for the decision-making stakeholders and
   policymakers. The proposed analysis application is illustrated through
   retrofitted residential communities with building energy rating (D) at
   different sizes (10, 25, 50,100, and 500 houses) located in Emmen
   (Netherlands) and compared to a standard decentralized heat pump. The
   optimization results show the ability of SDHS to provide a solar
   fraction up to 95\% in the community of 500 houses. Furthermore,
   achieving a NZEB status is only approved economically from a community
   size of 100 houses with a life cycle cost of 41 V/m2 and a payback
   period of 25 years. These results align with a substantial environmental
   and social improvement of 78.2\% and 29.7\%, respectively, compared to
   the decentralized heat pump. Overall, this study provides policy
   decision making with an evaluation for positive energy communities and
   suggests the SDHS integration to meet the global sustainability goals.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {134},
Number = {8},
Pages = {618-629},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The need to match project managers' (PMs) performance measures onto
   projects of both unique and similar characteristics has long since been
   acknowledged by researchers. The need for these measures to reflect the
   various phases of the project life cycle has also been contended in the
   recent past. Here, a competency-based multidimensional conceptual model
   is proposed for mass house building projects (MHBPs). The model reflects
   both performance behaviors and outcome in predicting the PMs'
   performances at the conceptual, planning, design, tender, construction,
   and operational phases of the project life cycle. Adopting a positivist
   approach, data elicited for the construction phase is analyzed using
   multiple regression techniques (stepwise selection). Out of a broad
   range of behavioral metrics identified as the independent variables, the
   findings suggest the best predictors of PMs' performances in MHBPs at
   the construction phase are: job knowledge in site layout techniques for
   repetitive construction works; dedication in helping works contractors
   achieve works schedule; job knowledge of appropriate technology transfer
   for repetitive construction works; effective time management practices
   on house units; ability to provide effective solution to conflicts,
   simultaneously maintaining good relationships; ease with which works
   contractors are able to approach the PM and volunteering to help works
   contractors solve personal problems. ANOVA, multicollineriality,
   Durbin-Watson, and residual analysis, confirm the goodness of fit.
   Validation of the model also reflected reasonably high predictive
   accuracy suggesting the findings could be generalized. These results
   indicate that the model can be a reliable tool for predicting the
   performance of PMs in MHBPs.},

Title = {Hierarchical SVM for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds for
   Infrastructure Scenes},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The incorporation of building information modeling (BIM) has brought
   about significant advancements in civil engineering, enhancing
   efficiency and sustainability across project life cycles. The
   utilization of advanced 3D point cloud technologies such as laser
   scanning extends the application of BIM, particularly in operations and
   maintenance, prompting the exploration of automated solutions for
   labor-intensive point cloud modeling. This paper presents a
   demonstration of supervised machine learning-specifically, a support
   vector machine-for the analysis and segmentation of 3D point clouds,
   which is a pivotal step in 3D modeling. The point cloud semantic
   segmentation workflow is extensively reviewed to encompass critical
   elements such as neighborhood selection, feature extraction, and feature
   selection, leading to the development of an optimized methodology for
   this process. Diverse strategies are implemented at each phase to
   enhance the overall workflow and ensure resilient results. The
   methodology is then evaluated using diverse datasets from infrastructure
   scenes of bridges and compared with state-of-the-art deep learning
   models. The findings highlight the effectiveness of supervised machine
   learning techniques at accurately segmenting 3D point clouds,
   outperforming deep learning models such as PointNet and PointNet++ with
   smaller training datasets. Through the implementation of advanced
   segmentation techniques, there is a partial reduction in the time
   required for 3D modeling of point clouds, thereby further enhancing the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the BIM process.},

Abstract = {The approach shown in this paper is a systematic, accurate and precise
   model building to be used in computing and predicting current scenario
   and future projection of a product in market respectively. Product
   change or updating may discontinue the production of any industry.
   Future forecast of the product will give time to switch over in new
   product. Forecasting is an important factor, to the most basics
   processes in any organization, to plan and deliver products. To be able
   to predict next purchases is a valuable thing to marketing. The
   methodology used in this paper is based on machine learning and deep
   learning for analyzing the data and fetch useful information from the
   patterns and trends. In previous methodology only a regressive approach
   is used for calculation of slope. But in our approach, we have used
   sentimental analysis of products by setting up models in a productive
   way and had occupied accurate models for each Case in a life cycle of
   product.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {A green building (GB) is a design idea that integrates environmentally
   conscious technology and sustainable procedures throughout the
   building's life cycle. However, because different green requirements and
   performances are integrated into the building design, the GB design
   procedure typically takes longer than conventional structures. Machine
   learning (ML) and other advanced artificial intelligence (AI), such as
   DL techniques, are frequently utilized to assist designers in completing
   their work more quickly and precisely. Therefore, this study aims to
   develop a GB design predictive model utilizing ML and DL techniques to
   optimize resource consumption, improve occupant comfort, and lessen the
   environmental effect of the built environment of the GB design process.
   A dataset ASHARE-884 is applied to the suggested models. An Exploratory
   Data Analysis (EDA) is applied, which involves cleaning, sorting, and
   converting the category data into numerical values utilizing label
   encoding. In data preprocessing, the Z-Score normalization technique is
   applied to normalize the data. After data analysis and preprocessing,
   preprocessed data is used as input for Machine learning (ML) such as RF,
   DT, and Extreme GB, and Stacking and Deep Learning (DL) such as GNN,
   LSTM, and RNN techniques for green building design to enhance
   environmental sustainability by addressing different criteria of the GB
   design process. The performance of the proposed models is assessed using
   different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and
   F1-score. The experiment results indicate that the proposed GNN and LSTM
   models function more accurately and efficiently than conventional DL
   techniques for environmental sustainability in green buildings.},

Title = {3D point cloud data processing with machine learning for construction
   and infrastructure applications: A comprehensive review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Point clouds are increasingly being used to improve productivity,
   quality, and safety throughout the life cycle of construction and
   infrastructure projects. While applicable for visualizing construction
   projects, point clouds lack meaningful semantic information. Thus, the
   theoretical benefits of point clouds, such as productivity, quality, and
   safety improvement, in the construction and infrastructure domains can
   only be achieved after the processing of point clouds. Manual processing
   of point cloud datasets is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. A
   variety of automatic approaches, such as machine learning methods, are
   adopted in different steps of automatic processing of point clouds. This
   article surveys recent research on point cloud datasets, which were
   automatically processed with machine learning methods in construction
   and infrastructure industries. An outline for future research is
   proposed based on identified research gaps. This review paper aims to be
   a reference for researchers to acknowledge the state-of-the-art
   applications of automatically-processed point cloud models in
   construction and infrastructure domains and a guide to assist
   stakeholders in developing automatic procedures in construction and
   infrastructure industries.},

Abstract = {The research and development field of structural health monitoring is
   evolving, and as a result, it now provides choices for disaster
   prevention and life cycle extension. This can help boost structural
   safety and infrastructures resiliency. Researchers have taken an
   interest in the use of machine learning techniques for these
   applications as a result of the promising outcomes that those approaches
   have delivered. In spite of this, damage detection applications
   necessitate the use of sophisticated and reliable data-driven enabled
   technologies. This is because of the complex behavior of structures that
   is notoriously difficult to track. In this investigation, triaxial
   accelerometers are used for data acquisition purposes in order to
   monitor and examine the structural performance of an experimental
   four-story building frame when subjected to a variety of structural
   configurations. The effectiveness of supervised machine learning
   algorithms was analyzed and compared to that of unsupervised learning
   approaches. In spite of the fact that supervised models have
   demonstrated good performances for the detection of initially
   established anomalies, they have only partially exhibited performances
   for newly produced damage patterns, which restricts their application in
   real life cases. The results obtained by the unsupervised algorithms, on
   the other hand, were comparable and satisfying, revealing essential
   capabilities for damage detection applications.},

Abstract = {Developing machine learning (ML) applications is similar to developing
   traditional software - it is often an iterative process in which
   developers navigate within a rich space of requirements, design
   decisions, implementations, empirical quality, and performance. In
   traditional software development, software engineering is the field of
   study which provides principled guidelines for this iterative process.
   However, as of today, the counterpart of ``software engineering for
   ML{''} is largely missing - developers of ML applications are left with
   powerful tools (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) but little guidance
   regarding the development lifecycle itself.
   In this paper, we view the management of ML development life-cycles from
   a data management perspective. We demonstrate two closely related
   systems, ease .ml/ ci and ease .ml/meter, that provide some ``principled
   guidelines{''} for ML application development: ci is a continuous
   integration engine for ML models and meter is a ``profiler{''} for
   controlling overfitting of ML models. Both systems focus on managing the
   ``statistical generalization power{''} of datasets used for assessing
   the quality of ML applications, namely, the validation set and the test
   set. By demonstrating these two systems we hope to spawn further
   discussions within our community on building this new type of data
   management systems for statistical generalization.},

Abstract = {The development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has enabled new
   opportunities, such as standard data storage and collaborative building
   design. Moreover, there exist many Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools and
   Building Energy Performance (BEP) simulators that use the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) exports of BIM platforms as input for further
   operational analysis. While the extracted IFC files contain numerical
   and tabular data from the BIM model, the visual data including floor
   plans and section drawings is often obtained directly from the original
   3D software such as REVIT. In this study, we introduce an open-source
   solution, BatchPlan, for batch processing IFC files of medium- and
   high-rise building projects, leading to floor plan extraction on a large
   scale. Furthermore, we have designed a user-friendly graphical interface
   that allows users to select floors manually. BatchPlan is based on
   open-source Python packages; thus users can easily edit and adapt it to
   their specific requirements. The presented solution enables a scalable
   data generation pipeline for downstream tasks that require extensive
   quantitative analysis, such as machine learning models to perform
   material detection, volume estimation, and environmental impact
   prediction.},

Title = {Categorising the existing irradiance based blind control occupant
   behavior models (BC-OBMs) using unsupervised machine learning approach:
   A case of office building in India},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {279},

Abstract = {This study aims to categorise the existing irradiance-based blind
   control occupant behaviour models (BCOBMs) into distinct clusters of the
   same characteristics using an unsupervised machine learning approach.
   Fourteen BC-OBMs, including two base case models (blinds always opened -
   AL1 and always closed - AL2), have been simulated for an office building
   in Tiruchirappalli, India and categorised into three distinct clusters
   named: Passive open (C1), Passive close (C2), and Active (C3). C1 and C2
   performed similarly to the base case models, AL1 and AL2, respectively.
   In contrast, C3 performed as an active cluster with a high number of
   blind movements (NBMs). This study also quantifies the degree of
   absolute error between the identified clusters and the base case model
   AL1 (as per the practice followed in Indian building energy codes) and
   emphasises the need to incorporate the BC-OBMs into the building energy
   codes to predict the artificial lighting consumption and lighting levels
   accurately. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is a novel
   attempt to categorise the existing irradiance-based BC-OBMs into
   distinct clusters. The research methodology adopted for this study can
   also be used in future research to categorise the window, artificial
   light, fan, and thermostat use OBMs into distinctive categories. (c)

Title = {Regression Models for Predicting the Global Warming Potential of Thermal
   Insulation Materials},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The impacts and benefits of thermal insulations on saving operational
   energy have been widely investigated and well-documented. Recently, many
   studies have shifted their focus to comparing the environmental impacts
   and CO2 emission-related policies of these materials, which are mostly
   the Embodied Energy (EE) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). In this
   paper, machine learning techniques were used to analyse the untapped
   aspect of these environmental impacts. A collection of over 120 datasets
   from reliable open-source databases including Okobaudat and Ecoinvent,
   as well as from the scientific literature containing data from the
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPD), was compiled and analysed.
   Comparisons of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector
   Regression (SVR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
   (LASSO) regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression
   methods were completed for the prediction task. The experimental results
   revealed that MLR, SVR, and LASSO methods outperformed the XGBoost
   method according to both the K-Fold and Monte-Carlo cross-validation
   techniques. MLR, SVR, and LASSO achieved 0.85/0.73, 0.82/0.72, and
   0.85/0.71 scores according to the R-2 measure for the Monte-Carlo/K-Fold
   cross-validations, respectively, and the XGBoost overfitted the training
   set, showing it to be less reliable for this task. Overall, the results
   of this task will contribute to the selection of effective yet
   low-energy-intensive thermal insulation, thus mitigating environmental
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Computer vision (CV) techniques have played an important role in
   promoting the informatization, digitization, and intelligence of
   industrial manufacturing systems. Considering the rapid development of
   CV techniques, we present a comprehensive review of the state of the art
   of these techniques and their applications in manufacturing industries.
   We survey the most common methods, including feature detection,
   recognition, segmentation, and three-dimensional modeling. A system
   framework of CV in the manufacturing environment is proposed, consisting
   of a lighting module, a manufacturing system, a sensing module, CV
   algorithms, a decision-making module, and an actuator. Applications of
   CV to different stages of the entire product life cycle are then
   explored, including product design, modeling and simulation, planning
   and scheduling, the production process, inspection and quality control,
   assembly, transportation, and disassembly. Challenges include algorithm
   implementation, data preprocessing, data labeling, and benchmarks.
   Future directions include building benchmarks, developing methods for
   nonannotated data processing, developing effective data preprocessing
   mechanisms, customizing CV models, and opportunities aroused by 5G.},

Title = {Machine learning driven building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) envelope
   design optimization},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {324},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {By integrating renewable energy systems (RESs) into buildings,
   Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) reshape the demand-supply
   relationship, offering substantial benefits such as reduced energy
   usage, lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved indoor comfort, and
   architectural enhancement. However, designing optimal BIPV systems
   involves balancing multiple parameters and conflicting objectives,
   making it a complex, computationally intensive process. This study
   proposes a data-driven optimization framework to enhance BIPV envelope
   design during the detailed design phase. The novelties of this research
   lie in 1) the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a surrogate
   model for rapid prediction, and 2) a multi-objective optimization
   (MOO)framework tailored for BIPV design at the detailed design phase.
   The proposed framework integrates ANN-based predictive modelling with an
   NSGA-II optimization component to generate optimal BIPV configurations
   efficiently. Implemented in Python, this approach is validated through a
   benchmark case study in Melbourne, demonstrating its effectiveness in
   reducing computational demands while achieving balanced energy,
   economic, and indoor comfort performance. This research advances
   sustainable building design by addressing gaps in current optimization
   frameworks and providing practical tools for architects and designers,
   promoting the wider adoption of BIPV solutions with significant
   computational savings.},

Abstract = {Requirements traceability provides important support throughout all
   software life cycle; however, creating such links manually is
   time-consuming and error-prone. Supervised automated solutions use
   machine learning or deep learning techniques to generate trace links,
   but require large labeled dataset to train an effective model.
   Unsupervised solutions as word embedding approaches can generate links
   by capturing the semantic meaning of artifacts and are gaining more
   attention. Despite that, our observation revealed that, besides the
   semantic information, the sequential information of terms in the
   artifacts would provide additional assistance for building the accurate
   links. This paper proposes an unsupervised requirements traceability
   approach (named S2Trace) which learns the Sequential Semantics of
   software artifacts to generate the trace links. Its core idea is to mine
   the sequential patterns and use them to learn the document embedding
   representation. Evaluation is conducted on five public datasets, and
   results show that our approach outperforms three typical baselines. The
   modeling of sequential information in this paper provides new insights
   into the unsupervised traceability solutions, and the improvement in the
   traceability accuracy further proves the usefulness of the sequential
   information.},

Abstract = {Buildings are exposed to damage and deterioration during their life
   cycle. So, damage assessment plays an important role in Structural
   stability. Cracks in the structures are of common occurrence, hence
   early detection of cracks is necessary. Damages like cracks can be
   detected using Microwave Imaging of the columns. Damages like Horizontal
   and vertical cracks are determined by training the Bayesian classifier
   and the Artificial Neural Networks. Both these approaches are required
   as Structural health to be monitored for predicting damages in columns.
   Crack detection system is built in columns of civil structures based on
   Artificial Neural Network and Bayesian Classifiers, which are
   constructed upon probabilistic pattern recognition and data modelling.
   The frequency data was collected from 12 microwave sensors for 30
   positions of column and is required to train and test the mathematical
   models. Since, mean and covariance of the statistical data are well
   known features used in feature extraction. Finally, performance analysis
   of the models has been provided in terms of Crack Error Rate (CER)
   justifies that dynamic modelling using ANN yields better results than
   Bayesian Classifiers and this can also he used in developing Automatic
   Crack detection systems of civil structures.},

Abstract = {Green building has witnessed significant growth in the North American
   market in recent years. Since the construction cost of green office
   buildings represents a significant impact on the life cycle costs in
   office buildings in North America, and since green building costs are
   still not well understood by building owners, a linear regression model
   is developed in this study to enable office building owners to predict
   the initial cost based on the structural and envelope materials used. A
   multi-regression model is then developed to forecast the initial
   construction cost based on the use of different combinations of
   materials, such as concrete and steel, for the envelope and structural
   systems. This model estimates the cost per square foot of mid-rise
   office buildings according to specified predictor parameters such as
   building structural system, number of floors, total floor area, and
   floor height. The process followed modal development consists of three
   main phases: preliminary quality diagnostics of gathered data, model
   development, and model testing and validation. This model can assist
   office building owners in estimating the initial cost of new buildings
   using green structural and envelope systems, and to provide decision
   support in the selection among alternatives from the economic point of
   view.},

Abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is the main building block of many
   deep learning models which are now becoming one of the most important
   kind of algorithms in machine leaning community. With the growing demand
   for information processing in aerospace computer, RBM can be used as a
   promising block supporting intelligent applications such as space
   self-control, intelligent recognition, and target classification. As for
   aerospace computer, a common challenge is the Single Event Upset (SEU)
   effect, which would change the state of some information bits
   stochastically and lead to error results. Due to the time-consuming and
   data-intensive computation of aerospace computer, digital signal
   processing (DSP) is the most suitable for aerospace computation. In this
   paper, we first implement representative RBM learning algorithm in a
   power efficient DSP platform. Then, we explore the possible SEU effects
   in our hardware architecture and RBM learning algorithm. Further, we
   integrate three software fault detection techniques (i.e. duplication,
   increasing data diversity, shortening life cycle of variable) into RBM
   learning. In the experiment, we utilize the simulated fault injection
   technique to evaluate fault detective RBM learning. The evaluation shows
   that our fault detection designs effectively detect SEU-induced error
   during RBM learning in DSP with low computational complexity.},

   called LSEbA that achieves to combine the aforementioned methods
   retaining the advantages of both approaches. Furthermore, the proposed
   method is consistent with the mixed nature of Software Cost Estimation
   data and takes advantage of the whole pure information of the dataset
   even if there is a large amount of missing values. The paper
   analytically illustrates the process of building such a model and
   presents the experimentation on three representative datasets verifying
   the benefits of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, bias and
   spread. Comparisons of LSEbA with linear regression, estimation by
   analogy and a combination of them, based on the average of their
   outcomes are made through accuracy metrics, statistical tests and a
   graphical tool, the Regression Error Characteristic curves.},

Abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly being used as an essential
   component of modern software systems. Also, the maturity of the adopted
   techniques and the availability of frameworks have changed the way
   developers approach ML-related development problems. This paper aims at
   investigating, by analyzing Stack Overflow (SO) posts related to ML, how
   the questions about ML have been changing over the years, and across six
   different programming languages. We analyzed 43,950 SO posts in the
   period 2008-2020, studying (i) how the number of ML-related posts
   changes over time for each programming language, (ii) how the posts are
   distributed across different phases of a ML pipeline, and (iii) whether
   posts belonging to different languages or phases are more or less
   challenging to address. We found that some programming languages are
   fading while others are becoming more popular in ML development. While
   model-building questions are the most discussed in general, the level of
   challenges posed by the other phases of the ML pipeline appears to be
   language-dependent. Results of this work could be used to better
   understand ML challenges in different programming languages, and,
   possibly, to improve ML tutorials related to different languages.},

Title = {Prediction of long-term deflections of reinforced-concrete members using

Abstract = {During the life cycle of buildings and infrastructure systems, the
   deflection of reinforced-concrete members generally increases due to
   both internal and external factors. Accurate forecasting of long-term
   deflection of these members can significantly enhance the effectiveness
   of structural maintenance processes. This research develops a hybrid
   data-driven method which employs the extreme gradient boosting machine
   and the particle swarm optimization metaheuristic for predicting
   long-term deflections of reinforced-concrete members. The former, a
   machine learning technique, generalizes a non-linear mapping function
   that helps to infer long-term deflection results from the input data.
   The later, a swarm-based metaheuristic, aims at optimizing the machine
   learning model by fine-tuning its hyper-parameters. The proposed
   hybridization of machine learning and swarm intelligence is constructed
   and verified by a dataset consisting of 217 experiments. The experiment
   results, supported by statistical tests, point out that the hybrid
   framework is able to attain good predictive performances with average
   root-mean-square error of 11.38 (a reduction of 17.4\%), and average
   coefficient of determination of 0.88 (an increase of 6.0\%) compared to
   the non-hybrid model. These results also outperform those obtained by
   other popular techniques, including Backpropagation Neural Networks and
   Regression Tree in several popular benchmarks, such as root-mean-square
   error, mean absolute percentage error, and the coefficient of
   determination R-2. This is backed up by statistical tests with the level
   of significance

Abstract = {Predictive models in analytical CRM (customer relationship management)
   are closely related to the customer's life cycle. Prediction of binary
   dependent variable refers to the most common areas such as customer
   acquisition, customer development (cross-selling and up-selling), and
   customer retention (churn analysis). While building static predictive
   models one usually applies decision trees, logistic regression, support
   vector machines or ensemble methods such as different algorithms of
   boosted decision trees or random forest. Recently one can observe
   increasing use of hybrid models in the analytical CRM, i.e. those that
   combine several different analytical tools, e.g. cluster analysis with
   decision trees, genetic algorithms with neural networks, or decision
   trees with logistic regression. The purpose of this paper is to compare
   the results obtained by using hybrid predictive CART-logit models with
   single decision tree models and logistic regression models. All analyses
   have been conducted on the basis of data sets relating to analytical
   CRM.},

Abstract = {It has long been recognized by the industry practitioners that how well
   preproject planning is conducted has a great impact on project outcome.
   Through industry project data collection and model analysis, this
   research intends to investigate the relationship between preproject
   planning and project success. Preproject planning and project
   performance information from 62 industrial projects and 78 building
   projects, representing approximately \$5 billion U.S.D. in total
   construction cost, is collected and used for this research analysis.
   Based on the information obtained, preproject planning is identified as
   having direct impact on the project success (cost and schedule
   performance). Two techniques were then used to develop models for
   predicting cost and schedule performance: statistical regression
   analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The research results
   provide a valuable source of information that supports better planning
   in the early stage of the project life cycle and have positive impact on
   the final project outcome. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the
   facility's life cycle for various applications, such as design,
   construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing
   buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using
   dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser
   scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the
   material and textural information of the buildings' elements. This paper
   presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture
   rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and
   textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using
   thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture
   thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These
   images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a
   segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are
   then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal
   infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to
   build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in
   each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural
   information from the images. The extracted textural and material
   information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing
   the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general
   including energy efficiency, among others.},

Title = {Energy Retrofit in European Building Portfolios: A Review of Five Key
   Aspects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The research about energy efficiency in buildings has exponentially
   increased during the last few years. Nevertheless, both research and
   practice still cannot rely on complete methodologies tailored for
   building portfolios as a whole, because the attention has always been
   drawn to individual premises. Yet, energy efficiency analyses need to go
   beyond the single building perspective and incorporate strategic
   district approaches to optimize the retrofit investment. For this
   purpose, several aspects should be considered simultaneously, and new
   methodologies should also be promoted. Therefore, this paper aims to
   discuss energy retrofit campaigns in building portfolios, drawing an
   exhaustive and updated review about the challenge of jumping from the
   single-building perspective to a stock-based analysis. This research
   discusses the publications available on the topic from five key aspects
   that are all essential steps in achieving a complete and reliable study
   of energy efficiency at a portfolio level. They are energy modelling and
   assessment, energy retrofit design, decision-making criteria assessment,
   optimal allocation of (financial) resources and risk valuation. This
   review, therefore, advocates for joint consideration of the problem as a
   basis on which to structure further disciplinary developments. Research
   gaps are highlighted, and new directions for future research are
   suggested.},

Abstract = {A digital twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets,

   represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical
   counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an

   clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a
   DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of
   buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier
   architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is
   specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on
   this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the
   University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates
   heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and
   analysis, supports decision-making processes in O\&M management, and
   further bridges the gap between human relationships with
   buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of
   developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical
   perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in
   developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT
   demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular
   DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers,
   and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at
   the building and city levels.},

Abstract = {This work studies the problem of identifying risk factors of Small for
   Gestational Age (SGA) and building classifiers for SGA prediction.
   Recently, SGA infants have received more and more concerns as this
   illness brings many difficulties to them along with their whole life.
   Some experts have begun to study the risk factors of SGA onset by using
   traditional statistical ways. Others have used logistic regression (LR)
   to construct SGA prediction models. Meanwhile, machine learning have
   evolved and envisioned as a tool able to potentially identify babies
   with SGA. This work tests several feature selection methods. Based on
   the risk factors obtained through them, it trains support vector
   machine, random forest, and LR models and evaluates them via 10-fold
   cross validation in terms of precision and area under the curve of
   receiver operator characteristic curve. The results show that sparse LR
   of the wrapper algorithms owns the best feature selection effectiveness.
   In addition, this work compares data driven factors and knowledge driven
   factors and shows that the feature selection is necessary and effective.
   Among the trained classifiers, the LR model achieves the best
   performance on the data driven factors.},

Title = {Development of an Improved Model to Predict Building Thermal Energy
   Consumption by Utilizing Feature Selection},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Humans spend approximately 90\% of the daytime in buildings, and
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by buildings account for approximately
   20\% of total GHG emissions. As the energy consumed during building
   operation from a building life-cycle perspective amounts to
   approximately 70-90\% of the total energy, it is essential to accurately
   predict the energy consumption of buildings for their efficient
   operation. This study aims to optimize a model for predicting the
   thermal energy consumption of buildings by (i) first extracting major
   variables through feature selection and deriving significant variables
   in addition to the collected data and (ii) predicting the thermal energy
   consumption using a machine learning model. Feature selection using
   random forest was performed, and 11 out of 17 available data were
   selected. The accuracy of the prediction model was significantly
   improved when the hour of day variable was added. The prediction model
   was constructed using an artificial neural network (ANN), and the
   improvement in the prediction accuracy was analyzed by comparing
   different cases of variable combinations. The ANN prediction accuracy
   was improved by 15\% using the feature selection process compared to
   when all data were used as input data, and 25\% coefficient of variation
   of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) accuracy was achieved.},

Abstract = {A new probabilistic framework is proposed for providing a
   distribution-free prediction interval (PI) of seismic responses required
   for various earthquake engineering applications. The framework overcomes
   the limitation of point prediction models and avoids the complexity of
   traditional probabilistic methods. The framework utilizes a few
   assumptions of probability distributions and requires no prior assumed
   statistical distribution for the PI. Ensemble probabilistic deep
   learning models (DLMs) are used to provide quality-driven PIs of seismic
   responses for low- to mid-rise buildings with limited irregularity.
   Considering these systems and ground motions with the aid of Monte Carlo
   simulation and nonlinear time-history analysis (NLTHA), huge datasets
   are generated for training. To have an insight into the probabilistic
   DLM, explainable artificial intelligence techniques are used. The
   superiority of the proposed framework in quantifying uncertainties is
   validated by comparison with the conventional Bayesian method. In
   addition, its applicability is investigated by providing bounds of
   seismic fragility curves, life cycle cost, and resilience index obtained
   by NLTHA for a benchmark case study model. The results showed that the
   proposed framework is robust and outperforms the conventional Bayesian
   method in uncertainty quantification for the considered dataset.},

Abstract = {Accounting for around 40\% of total energy consumption, buildings in
   industrialized countries are a particular focus for saving energy.
   Especially digital twins and building information modeling (BIM) can
   serve as a mean to improve operational processes, detect faulty
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) components which lead to an
   increased energy consumption and evaluate future renovation
   possibilities during a buildings life cycle. To enable these advantages
   a transition from existing HVAC diagrams to a machine-readable
   representation including spatial and functional interrelationship of all
   components as well as their semantic relationship is necessary.
   Especially in retrofit cases the manual transition is a time-intensive
   and an error prone process. The present work aims to develop a procedure
   for the (partially) automated recognition of HVAC diagrams and
   extraction of information about their intercorrelation. In order to
   achieve the desired results, we use multiple approaches of computer
   vision, both conventional as well as more recent ones using artificial
   intelligence such as ``Faster R-CNN{''}. The developed pipeline consists
   of three basic steps: Find symbols of components, find connecting lines,
   combine the extracted information into a machine-readable
   representation. Due to privacy issues, only very few real diagrams are
   available. To evaluate our approach we developed a data generator to
   train and test our pipeline. The obtained results show that to a large
   extend it is already possible to transfer relevant information from
   technical diagrams into a machine-readable format in order to reduce the
   effort of creating and validating digital twins and BIM for retrofits.},

Title = {Multi-objective optimal energy-efficient retrofit determination using
   hybrid urban building energy model: Considering uncertainties between
   models},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 18},
Abstract = {Typical energy-efficient retrofit studies based on urban building energy
   models face challenges in quickly obtaining appropriate retrofit
   solutions and often ignore the unexpected outcomes caused by inherent
   model uncertainty. To solve it, this study proposes a decision support
   framework that integrates a hybrid urban building energy model (UBEM)
   method, NSGA-II, and TOPSIS to obtain rapidly the optimal
   energy-efficient retrofit solutions that take into account model
   uncertainty. The study took the building groups in Sipailou campus as a
   case study and identified 76 ``stable solutions{''} and 149 ``active
   solutions{''} that minimize energy consumption, carbon emission, and
   life-cycle cost (LCC) over 30 years from 40,353,607 retrofit schemes.
   Key findings include that when considering model uncertainty, the
   quantities, types, and ranks of optimal retrofit solutions have changed.
   When the error of baseline UBEM validation is within +/- 5\% and
   considering uncertainty transmission from energy simulation to ANN
   model, the energy-saving potential of optimal retrofit schemes has
   expanded from {[}63.78, 65.05]\% to {[}60, 68.75]\%, carbon-saving
   potential has shifted from {[}63.69, 64.09]\% to {[}59.92, 67.79]\%, and
   the LCC has changed from {[}-40.68, 14.59] x 106 to {[}-38.25, 16.97] x
   106 Yuan. This study provides decision makers with a scientific approach
   to consider the potential uncertainties and risks associated with
   optimal retrofit solutions.},

Title = {On the Robustness of ML-Based Network Intrusion Detection Systems: An
   Adversarial and Distribution Shift Perspective},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Utilizing machine learning (ML)-based approaches for network intrusion
   detection systems (NIDSs) raises valid concerns due to the inherent
   susceptibility of current ML models to various threats. Of particular
   concern are two significant threats associated with ML: adversarial
   attacks and distribution shifts. Although there has been a growing
   emphasis on researching the robustness of ML, current studies primarily
   concentrate on addressing specific challenges individually. These
   studies tend to target a particular aspect of robustness and propose
   innovative techniques to enhance that specific aspect. However, as a
   capability to respond to unexpected situations, the robustness of ML
   should be comprehensively built and maintained in every stage. In this
   paper, we aim to link the varying efforts throughout the whole ML
   workflow to guide the design of ML-based NIDSs with systematic
   robustness. Toward this goal, we conduct a methodical evaluation of the
   progress made thus far in enhancing the robustness of the targeted NIDS
   application task. Specifically, we delve into the robustness aspects of
   ML-based NIDSs against adversarial attacks and distribution shift
   scenarios. For each perspective, we organize the literature in
   robustness-related challenges and technical solutions based on the ML
   workflow. For instance, we introduce some advanced potential solutions
   that can improve robustness, such as data augmentation, contrastive
   learning, and robustness certification. According to our survey, we
   identify and discuss the ML robustness research gaps and future
   direction in the field of NIDS. Finally, we highlight that building and
   patching robustness throughout the life cycle of an ML-based NIDS is

Title = {Empirically Modeling the Energy Implications of Cool Roof Retrofits},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {The energy effects of roofs have primarily been studied using
   theoretical models. However, empirical methods are needed for validation
   or when not all drivers of energy change can be observed. This study
   used mixed empirical techniques to estimate the impact of whitening
   existing roofs. Two years of hourly site cooling energy use were
   collected for 114 homes in Austin, TX. Seven properties selected to have
   their roofs coated white at no charge, imitating incentive policies. The
   empirical results are mixed, primarily limited by the small treated
   sample size. Individual household comparisons generally demonstrate
   statistically significant impacts of whitening, ranging from 14\% to
   49.2\% reductions in daytime site cooling energy use and a 9.7\%
   increase to a 40.3\% decrease in nighttime site cooling energy use.
   Ordinary least squares regression estimates statistically significant
   mean daytime reductions of 9.7\% but no significant nighttime effects.
   However, clustering the standard errors by household substantially
   reduces the significance level. Tweedie regression, which better
   accommodates slightly inflated zeros in the sample, demonstrates
   significant daytime and nighttime reductions of 14.3\% and 5.5\%,
   respectively. A life-cycle costs analysis using a mix of primary and
   secondary data explored the secondary benefit of delaying roof
   replacement resulting from the added protection of the coating material.
   Absent this delay, whitening would pay for itself in only 41\% of
   simulations with a median net cost of \$310 and simple payback of 22
   years. Including a benefit to delay roof replacement, the median payback
   period is 1 year and the median net benefit is \$310 across a range of
   assumptions. However, the benefits of whitening are only robust for
   older roofs and longer service lives for the coating. For roofs older
   than 10 years of age, most simulations reflect net benefits if the
   coating lasts at least 5 years.},

Title = {Refurbishment of office buildings in New Zealand: identifying priorities
   for reducing environmental impacts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1480-1495},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {PurposeIn recent years, the building sector has highlighted the
   importance of operational energy and efficient resource management in
   order to reduce the environmental impacts of buildings. However,
   differences in building-specific properties (building location, size,
   construction material, etc.) pose a major challenge in development of
   generic policy on buildings. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the relationship between energy and resource management policies, and
   building-specific characteristics on environmental impacts of
   refurbished office buildings in New Zealand.MethodsLife Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) was performed for 17 office buildings operating under seven
   representative climatic conditions found in New Zealand. Each building
   was assessed under fourpolicy scenarios: (i) business-as-usual, (ii) use
   of on-site photovoltaic (PV) panels, (iii) electricity supply from a
   renewable energy grid, and (iv) best practice construction activities
   adopted at site. The influence of 15 building-specific characteristics
   in combination with each scenario was evaluated. The study adopted
   regression analysis, more specifically Kruskal-Wallis and General
   Additive Modeling (GAM), to support interpretation of the LCA
   results.Results and discussionAll the chosen policies can significantly
   contribute to climate change mitigation as compared to
   business-as-usual. However, the Kruskal-Wallis results highlight
   policies on increasing renewable energy sources supplying national grid
   electricity can substantially reduce the impacts across most
   environmental impact categories. Better construction practices should be
   prioritized over PV installation as use of on-site PV significantly
   increases the environmental impacts related to use of resources. The GAM
   results show on-site PV could be installed in low-rise buildings in
   regions with long sunshine hours. The results also show the strong
   influence of facade elements and technical equipment in determining the
   environmental performance of small and large buildings, respectively. In
   large multi-storied buildings, efficient HVAC and smaller window area
   are beneficial features, while in small buildings the choice of facade
   materials with low embodied impacts should be prioritized.ConclusionsIn
   general, the study highlighted the importance of policies on increasing
   renewable energy supply from national grid electricity to substantially
   reduce most of the impacts related to buildings. In addition, the study
   also highlighted the importance of better construction practices and
   building-specific characteristics to reduce the impacts related to
   resource use. These findings can support policy makers to prioritize
   strategies to improve the environmental performance of existing
   buildings in New Zealand and in regions with similar building
   construction and climate.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a summary of an energy benchmarking study that uses
   performance data of a sample of Information Technology facilities in
   Bangalore. Information provided by the sample of occupiers was used to
   develop an Energy Performance Index (EPI) and an Annual Average hourly
   Energy Performance Index (AAhEPI), which takes into account the
   variations in operation hours and days for these facilities. The EPI and
   AAhEPI were modelled to identify the factors that influence energy
   efficiency. Employment density, size of facility, operating hours per
   week, type of chiller and age of facility were found to be significant
   factors in regression models with ER! and AAhEPI as dependent variables.
   Employment density, size of facility and operating hours per week were
   standardised and used in a separate regression analysis. Parameter
   estimates from this regression were used to normalize the EN and AAhEPI
   for variance in the independent variables. Three benchmark ranges - the
   bottom third, middle third and top third were developed for the two
   normalised indices. The normalised EPI and AAhEPI of LEED rated
   building, which were also part of the sample, indicate that, on average,
   LEED rated buildings outperform the other buildings. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Materials are continuously accumulating in the human-built environment
   since massive amounts of materials are required for building,
   developing, and maintaining cities. At the end of their life cycles,
   these materials are considered valuable sources of secondary materials.
   The increasing construction and demolition waste released from aging
   stock each year make up the heaviest, most voluminous waste outflow,
   presenting challenges and opportunities. These material stocks should be
   utilized and exploited since the reuse and recycling of construction
   materials would positively impact the natural environment and resource
   efficiency, leading to sustainable cities within a grander scheme of a
   circular economy. The exploitation of material stock is known as urban
   mining. In order to make these materials accessible for future mining,
   material quantities need to be estimated and extrapolated to regional
   levels. This demanding task requires a vast knowledge of the existing
   building stock, which can only be obtained through labor-intensive,
   time-consuming methodologies or new technologies, such as building
   information modeling (BIM), geographic information systems (GISs),
   artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. This review paper
   gives a general overview of the literature body and tracks the evolution

Abstract = {Application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the AEC
   industry has been evolving. With new developments and increasing
   capabilities, BIM is reshaping the design, construction, and operation,
   and maintenance processes and revolutionizing the entire functions of
   building life cycles. To maximize BIM benefits and take advantage of its
   capabilities, it is imperative that project stakeholders define specific
   roles and responsibilities within projects; to employ professionals with
   high levels of BIM proficiency, expertise, and knowledge. This study
   aims to classify the construction firms into different clusters based on
   their BIM capabilities, implementation, BIM levels, and type of BIM
   roles they employ for construction projects. It will further predict and
   classify BIM levels at company level according to its usage. The
   methodology was based on a survey design which consisted of application
   an online questionnaire that was distributed to AEC professionals in the
   industry. 61 suitable responses were analysed, using different
   supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including
   Cluster Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (k-NN), Random Forest,
   and Gradient Boosting. The findings showed most firms were not applying
   BIM on their projects and the majority of those that did were not
   utilizing it in its full potential. Firms were further classified in
   terms of BIM levels and types of BIM applications they utilize on
   construction projects. The results showed that Random Forest had the
   highest performance and the most accuracy, comparing with KNN and
   Gradient Boosting, even though the performance and predictions results
   produced by all models were in proximity of one another.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to review and reflect upon the built up scientific
   knowledge on Building Condition Assessment (BCA) using Key Performance
   Indicators (KPIs), supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM), to
   implement appropriate maintenance and rehabilitation activities. For
   this purpose, a literature review related to KPIs applied to BCA and
   using BIM to BCA has been performed. KPIs applied to BCA were studied
   and their calibration and validation methods were identified, as well as
   their potential to support BIM in BCA. Furthermore, current researches
   in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
   applied to the optimization of BCA were also presented. This work
   concludes that despite the studies that have been conducted, only a few
   focuses on KPIs integration in BIM due to some limitations that still
   exist. These limitations are related to the application of BIM on
   building inspections and the limitation of KPIs scope and
   interoperability with BIM. Considering the identified gaps in the most
   relevant research trends on the subject, the present study discusses the
   viability of adjustments on KPIs based on reliable validation and
   calibration methods and combine them to ML algorithms in order to
   develop a more robust BIM-BCA strategy, thereby filling in the
   above-mentioned limitations.},

Title = {Quantitative impact analysis of driving factors on annual residential
   building energy end-use combining machine learning and stochastic
   methods},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Residential buildings consume a large amount of energy in operation,
   which can be reduced by planning energyefficient design and operation
   strategies. Understanding and quantifying the impact of key driving
   factors to the residential building energy end-use is essential for
   promoting more energy-efficient building design and operation schemes.
   Although the climate, building, and occupant-related features have been
   proven as the key driving factors to residential building energy
   end-use, their impacts are rarely compared and quantified
   simultaneously. This study conducts the first attempt in combining the
   machine learning method with Monte Carlo method to quantify the impacts
   of these key driving factors simultaneously. Data collected from the
   Residential Energy Consumption Survey 2015 of the U.S. was investigated
   in this study. The results indicate that the total energy end-use has
   positive correlations with the total building area, rooms' numbers,
   windows' numbers, indoor heating temperature setpoint and the occupants'
   age; and has a negative correlation with the cooling temperature
   setpoint; the impacts of heating degree days and cooling degree days are
   nonlinear and complicated; the impact of the level of insulation is
   nuanced and offset by the harsh climate. The results of this study
   contribute good references to policymakers and architects for the
   synthesis of energy-efficient residential building design and operation;
   guidelines can be developed for the future survey on residential
   building energy for relevant and precise data collection to improve the
   building energy modelling.},

Title = {Integration of Augmented Reality and Building Information Modeling for
   Enhanced Construction Inspection-A Case Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research addresses a significant challenge in the construction
   industry: the traditional reliance on CAD drawings and manual methods
   for building inspection and monitoring. This article presents a
   transformative proposal utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) to
   revolutionize these processes. The proposed model is based on an
   innovative integration of AR technology with Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), aiming to enhance data life-cycle management and improve
   the efficiency of construction management practices. The main goal of
   the article is to demonstrate the practical feasibility and benefits of
   this AR-BIM integration in construction management, particularly in the
   realms of inspection and monitoring. This involves developing and
   testing an accessible, user-friendly, and affordable AR application
   prototype for mobile devices, employing multiple markers, as a potential
   replacement for traditional methods. The research methodology comprises
   five phases, starting with the conversion of 2D CAD drawings into 3D
   BIM, followed by the simulation of AR-BIM integration at a construction
   site using a commercial AR application. This is succeeded by assessing
   the applicability of the commercial AR app and developing a
   multiple-marker AR application prototype suitable for general platforms.
   The final phase encompasses the testing and evaluation of this
   prototype. The findings suggest that the integration of 3D BIM with AR
   technology is not only feasible, but also beneficial in replacing
   paper-based processes, thereby enhancing information sharing,
   communication, and overall project execution efficiency. However, the
   accuracy of the superimposition between virtual and actual objects needs
   improvement to reduce discrepancies between as-built and as-planned
   scenarios. These results hold significant potential for transforming
   construction project execution by replacing traditional methods with
   more efficient digital solutions. Future research directions include
   extensive testing in various construction scenarios, improving model
   complexity handling, exploring the application of machine learning
   algorithms for data analysis, and expanding the study to encompass other
   stages of the construction lifecycle.},

Title = {On the development of multi-linear regression analysis to assess energy
   consumption in the early stages of building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Modeling of energy consumption in buildings is essential for different
   applications such as building energy management and establishing
   baselines. This makes building energy consumption estimation as a key
   tool to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Energy performance of
   building is complex, since it depends on several parameters related to
   the building characteristics, equipment and systems, weather, occupants,
   and sociological influences. This paper presents a new model to predict
   and quantify energy consumption in commercial buildings in the early
   stages of building design. Building simulation software including eQUEST
   and DOE-2 was used to build and simulate individual building
   configuration that were generated using Monte Carlo simulation
   techniques. Ten thousands simulations for seven building shapes were
   performed to create a comprehensive dataset covering the full ranges of
   design parameters. The present study considered building materials,
   their thickness, building shape, and occupant schedule as design
   variables since building energy performance is sensitive to these
   variables. Then, the results of the energy simulations were implemented
   into a set of regression equation to predict the energy consumption in
   each design scenario. A good agreement was seen between the predicted
   data based on the developed regression model and DOE simulation and the
   maximum error was less than 5\%. It is envisioned that the developed
   regression models can be used to estimate the total energy consumption
   in the early stages of the design when different building schemes and
   design concepts are being considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Construction materials play an important role in environmental impacts
   and make cities big resource consumers. To assess the sustainability of
   cities, the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Material
   Flow Analysis (MFA) is considered effective to analyze construction
   material stock and flows. However, exhaustive data is required for such
   analyses, making LCA and MFA difficult to apply at the urban scale.
   Building information, the essential ingredient, is rarely available
   openly. Common approaches to gather the required data include both
   obtaining it directly from available datasets, e.g. open data from
   official sources, and indirectly generating data based on available
   data, e.g. using machine learning to fill the missing gaps. This
   research develops a data collection guideline for buildings' geometrical
   features, components and materials at the urban scale in the context of
   LCA and MFA. First, it identifies the basic steps of urban-scale
   building stock modelling and the list of data requirements. Second, the
   factors influencing the data collection are pointed out. In line with
   these guidelines, this research picks Singapore as a study area,
   reviewing the relevant authoritative open data sources and methodologies
   to estimate missing data. Finally, the suggestion on implementation of
   data collection are provided. When the data collection for urban scale
   stock modelling is limited by uncertain reality conditions, identifying
   and combining open datasets and data generation methods for data
   preparation is a necessity.},

Title = {Towards Frugal Industrial AI: a framework for the development of
   scalable and robust machine learning models in the shop floor},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 1},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) among other digital technologies promise to
   deliver the next level of process efficiency of manufacturing systems.
   Although these solutions such as machine learning (ML) based condition
   monitoring and quality inspection are becoming popular, these work under
   very limited conditions. Solutions do not scale-up in the real
   environment, where there is a mix of manufacturing equipment, where the
   quality and quantity of data available changes from machine to machine,
   or where the process changes, changing the distribution of data (i.e.
   concept drift). This is particularly challenging in highly
   reconfigurable and flexible environments. Having to develop machine
   learning models from scratch every single time is not cost-effective,
   time-consuming, requires expert knowledge that is typically not
   available in the manufacturing environment as well as can be challenging
   when data is not available in high volumes. Model robustness,
   reusability, adaptability and life cycle management are the keys to
   scale-up this technology in the manufacturing industry. In this work, a
   conceptual framework to enable simple and robust ML model development
   for the shop floor is introduced. Referred here as Frugal Industrial AI,
   the approach takes advantage of existing models and their context to
   build more robust ones in a data-efficient manner. Using a semantic
   knowledge base of how to construct these models for different
   manufacturing applications and semi-automating the development or reuse
   of solutions through semantic similarity, it is demonstrated how models
   can be developed in a more streamlined way. In addition, it is
   demonstrated how capturing process context information is important for
   the effective reuse of existing models through continual learning. This
   is key to building more robust ML solutions that can deal with real
   changing manufacturing environments, avoiding retraining from scratch as
   well as enabling the non-expert to use AI effectively on the shop floor.},

Title = {Comparing multiple linear regression and neural network models for
   predicting heating energy consumption in school buildings in the
   Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {During the design of buildings in the preliminary stages of preparing
   project documentation and for the purpose of analysing the overall life
   cycle costs of buildings, particularly in the evaluation of alternative
   design solutions, there is often need for a rapid and straightforward
   assessment of thermal energy consumption expenditures. To fulfil this
   requirement, it is essential to develop new and to continuously refine
   existing mathematical estimation models. These models facilitate swift
   and uncomplicated assessments based on a reduced set of parameters or
   building characteristics that are readily determinable and available in
   the design phase. The paper compares the accuracy of multiple linear
   regression models and neural network models in predicting energy
   consumption for heating school buildings in the Federation of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. The models were trained on a database, and their prediction
   ability was assessed through generalization and correlation analysis.
   The paper underscores neural networks' advantages, including their
   capacity for automatic network construction and management of nonlinear
   relationships. It specifically cites the cascade-correlation algorithm
   as a rapid learning technique for constructing deep neural networks. In
   essence, this paper offers discernment into the precision and efficacy
   of both multiple linear regression models and neural network models in
   predicting heating energy consumption of school buildings in Federation
   of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We evaluate the developed models for
   predicting delivered thermal energy consumption, and our discussion
   furnishes detailed results of an accuracy comparison among these models.},

Abstract = {Building upon decades of research with the lifelong (nine-decade) Terman
   Life Cycle Study, we present a life pathway model for understanding
   human thriving that accounts for long-term individual difference in

   from the Terman study (N=570 males, 451 females), we employed regression
   and survival analyses to test models of childhood personality predicting
   adult psychosocial factors (subjective well-being, family relationships,
   community involvement, subjective achievement, hardships) and subsequent
   longevity. Child personality differentially related to midlife social
   relationships, well-being, and hardships. Conscientiousness and good
   social relationships predicted longer life, whereas subjective
   well-being was unrelated to mortality risk. Examining multiple life
   factors across long time periods uncovers important pathways through
   which personality relates to premature mortality or longevity. Typical
   stress-and-illness models are untenable and should be replaced with life

   There have been many studies focusing on IoT Botnet malware detection
   using static and dynamic analysis. In particular, the combination of the
   dynamic method with machine learning has shown outstanding advantages to
   detect IoT Botnet variants. However, the preprocessing of behavioral
   data originated from malware is still complicated, and the number of
   input vector dimensions of the machine learning model is still huge. In
   addition, these models also consume a lot of resources and have limited
   detection capabilities. Besides, dynamic analysis studies based on
   system calls mostly use call frequency characteristics and have not
   effectively exploited IoT Botnet malware's life cycle characteristics.
   In this paper, we propose the Directed System Call Graph (DSCG) feature
   to sequentially structure the system calls. This DSCG graph will be
   vectorized and used as an input for building a malware analysis model
   based on popular machine learning classifiers such as KNN, SVM, Decision
   Tree, etc. Experiments on the datasets demonstrate that the features
   extracted from this graph have low complexity but still ensure high
   accuracy in detecting IoT Botnets, especially with newly emerged IoT
   Botnet families. The proposed model was evaluated with ACC = 98.01\%,
   TPR = 97.93\%, FPR = 1.5\%, AUC = 0.9961 on a dataset of 5023 IoT
   Botnets and 3888 benign samples.},

Title = {Interpretable Data-Driven Methods for Building Energy Modelling-A Review
   of Critical Connections and Gaps},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Technological improvements are crucial for achieving decarbonisation
   targets and addressing the impacts of climate change in the built
   environment via mitigation and adaptation measures. Data-driven methods
   for building performance prediction are particularly important in this
   regard. Nevertheless, the deployment of these technologies faces
   challenges, particularly in the domains of artificial intelligence (AI)
   ethics, interpretability and explainability of machine learning (ML)
   algorithms. The challenges encountered in applications for the built
   environment are amplified, particularly when data-driven solutions need
   to be applied throughout all the stages of the building life cycle and
   to address problems from a socio-technical perspective, where human
   behaviour needs to be considered. This requires a consistent use of
   analytics to assess the performance of a building, ideally by employing
   a digital twin (DT) approach, which involves the creation of a digital
   counterpart of the building for continuous analysis and improvement.
   This paper presents an in-depth review of the critical connections
   between data-driven methods, AI ethics, interpretability and their
   implementation in the built environment, acknowledging the complex and
   interconnected nature of these topics. The review is organised into
   three distinct analytical levels: The first level explores key issues of
   the current research on the interpretability of machine learning
   methods. The second level considers the adoption of interpretable
   data-driven methods for building energy modelling and the problem of
   establishing a link with the third level, which examines physics-driven
   grey-box modelling techniques, in order to provide integrated modelling
   solutions. The review's findings highlight how the interpretability
   concept is relevant in multiple contexts pertaining to energy and the
   built environment and how some of the current knowledge gaps can be
   addressed by further research in the broad area of data-driven methods.},

Title = {Temporal dynamic assessment of household energy consumption and carbon
   emissions in China: From the perspective of occupants},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Global warming has become a challenge and reducing carbon emissions is
   an urgent task. Household energy con-sumption and carbon emissions are
   substantial and need to be analyzed and assessed. Considering the
   significant influence of occupants and the possible dynamic changes
   during the long operation process of buildings, this study proposes a
   dynamic household energy consumption and carbon emissions assessment
   model from the oc-cupant's perspective. The model consists of four
   modules of occupant information collection, energy calculation, machine
   learning models, and dynamic carbon prediction. Five major energy
   sources are assessed: space cooling, space heating, hot water, cooking,
   and domestic appliances. The temporal variations in occupant profiles,
   behav-iors, and the carbon factor of energy are quantified and taken
   into account. The average carbon emissions of a household during
   2020-2060 in three dynamic scenarios are assessed, and general downward
   trends are re-vealed. The specific dynamic carbon levels of ``double
   income, no kids{''} (DINK) households, nuclear households, and
   three-generation households are also quantified, and obvious temporal
   changes and significant differences are found. The influence of China's
   childbearing policy is quantified and discussed. The dynamic assessment
   re-sults are compared with the static results, showing that the largest
   accumulated difference during 41 years can reach 25.1 tCO2-eq. This
   paper proposes an applicable dynamic assessment model from the
   perspective of occupants, with temporal variations considered. The
   assessment results provide a strong reference for future energy-saving
   and emission-reduction plans at the household level.(c) 2023 Institution

Abstract = {The provision of energy efficient real estate has become increasingly
   important from an ecological and economical perspective. Focusing on
   heating energy consumption of schools and sport facilities, this study
   introduces a standardized but flexible estimation model for the practice
   of real estate management. This allows significant parameters to be
   identified in order to accurately benchmark and forecast heating energy
   consumption. An explorative data analysis forms the basis of the
   investigation. In particular, the study examines the standard and
   condition of building characteristics, buildings' utilization and
   location for a random sample of 105 properties within Stuttgart
   (Germany). Based on statistical pre-analysis and an evaluation of
   different linear and non-linear regression models, the most appropriate
   model to explain differences in final heating energy consumption is
   presented. The transferability of the introduced model is evaluated,
   conducting a validation test and performing a post-hoc power analysis to
   discuss the probability of inferences about examined population
   parameters. The investigation verifies that the presented model provides
   consistent, unbiased and efficient estimates and allows conclusive
   inferences beyond the underlying random sample. In addition, the
   different application fields of the presented model are described and
   the practical significance of delineate factors are demonstrated by
   various scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The speed in which the processes used in software development field have
   changed makes it very difficult the task of forecasting the overall
   costs for a software project. By many researchers, this task has been
   considered unachievable, but there is a group of scientist for which
   this task can be solved using the already known mathematical methods
   (e.g. multiple linear regressions) and the new techniques as genetic
   programming and neural networks. The paper presents a solution for
   building a model for the cost estimation models in the software project
   management using genetic algorithms starting from the PROMISE datasets
   related COCOMO 81 model. In the first part of the paper, a summary of
   the major achievements in the research area of finding a model for
   estimating the overall project costs is presented together with the
   description of the existing software development process models. In the
   last part, a basic proposal of a mathematical model of a genetic
   programming is proposed including here the description of the chosen
   fitness function and chromosome representation. The perspective of model
   described it linked with the current reality of the software development
   considering as basis the software product life cycle and the current
   challenges and innovations in the software development area. Based on
   the author's experiences and the analysis of the existing models and
   product lifecycle it was concluded that estimation models should be
   adapted with the new technologies and emerging systems and they depend
   largely by the chosen software development method.},

   found respectively the most and less diversified contexts, outlining a
   diversification gradient negatively associated with the distance from

   with high and low diversification in socioeconomic functions. A
   spatially-explicit regression model finally demonstrates that
   local-scale complexity increases with urban concentration, population
   growth and average per-capita income. A multivariate analysis of

Title = {Analysis and benchmarking of greenhouse gas emissions of luxury hotels},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {56-66},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hotels are one of the most energy intensive building types due to their
   multi-usage functions and round the clock operations. We investigated
   the energy consumption of 58 Taiwanese luxury hotels for greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and
   methane (CH4). The average yearly GHG emission density of the
   investigated hotels is 132 kg-CO(2)e/m(2). The results show an expected
   29 kg of equivalent carbon dioxide emission (CO(2)e) for each
   accommodated guest/night, or 50 kg-CO(2)e generated for each room/night
   sold. A multiple regression model was established to normalize the GHG
   emission intensity, which includes GHG emissions potential variables and
   a benchmark model, plotted as a cumulative percentile distribution, in
   which hotels can rank their GHG emissions intensity. By comparing hotel
   GHG emission performances, hotel managers can determine if and where
   improvements should be implemented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Rapid diffusion of mobile telephone services is accompanied with low
   satisfaction and high switching behavior many markets. Despite the
   popularity of technology diffusion studies in marketing literature,
   limited research concentrate on the impact Of marketing mix variables
   vis-a-vis clients' satisfaction. Much fewer studies were conducted in
   developing nations. This paper investigates the influence Of Marketing
   mix on clients' satisfaction with innovation adoption in Nigerian GSM
   market. Building on Technology Adoption Life-Cycle Model and extensive
   literature review, six constructs were theoretically developed and
   statistically validated. Multiple regression run on a sample of 373
   subscribers drawn from four universities, indicates the five marketing
   mix variables predict 52\% of the variance on clients' satisfaction.
   Furthermore beta coefficients revealed Core Service (038) makes the
   strongest unique contribution in explaining clients' Satisfaction
   followed by Pricing at 0.22. while Distribution (0.072) is the only
   variable not making significant contribution to the model.},

Abstract = {Prediction of machine tool failure has been very important in modern
   metal cutting operations in order to meet the growing demand for product
   quality and cost reduction. This paper presents the study of building a
   neural network model for predicting the behavior of a boring process
   during its full life cycle. This prediction is achieved by the fusion of
   the predictions of three principal components extracted as features from
   the joint time-frequency distributions of energy of the spindle loads
   observed during the boring process. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty
   is assessed using nonlinear regression in order to quantify the errors
   associated with the prediction. The results show that the implemented
   Elman recurrent neural network is a viable method for the prediction of
   the feature behavior of the boring process, and that the constructed
   confidence bounds provide information crucial for subsequent maintenance
   decision making based on the predicted cutting tool degradation.},

Title = {Urban systems exploration: A generic process for multi-objective urban
   planning to support decision making in early design phases},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {254},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The competition for limited urban spaces due to the growing demand for
   both living space and green areas causes conflicts in urban development.
   This paper aims to provide urban planners with a systematic
   multicriteria decision making process and a supporting tool-chain. The
   process uses multi -objective optimization (MOO) to quantify trade-offs,
   allowing planners to gain a broad perspective on optimal solutions. The
   generic process builds an urban simulation model, applies MOO, explores
   the results in terms of multicriteria trade-offs, and guides the
   decision making of urban planners. To enable this process, we present a
   tool-chain for applying a Gaussian Process Regression based MOO
   algorithm to a computationally expensive urban simulation model. The
   tool-chain allows to identify Pareto -optimal solutions and their
   properties with reasonable computational effort. A case study model is
   set up in the Grasshopper environment and couples simulation components
   for outdoor thermal comfort and Life Cycle Assessment. It allows to
   identify multiobjective trade-offs for a high-dimensional space of urban
   configuration degrees of freedom such as outdoor vegetation,
   photovoltaics, and building characteristics. We compare the workflow
   results to other MOO algorithms and show how it can support decision
   making in urban planning at early design phases. In our case study, the
   tool chain was able to investigate the multi dimensional space of urban
   configurations. It systematically identified Pareto -optimal solutions
   therein and reduced the number of model evaluations significantly. The
   case study results showcase the trade -off between lifecycle-based
   global warming potential (GWP) and outdoor thermal comfort. We
   identified the number of trees and the coverage of the east and west fa
   \& ccedil;ades with photovoltaics as the most important parameters. The
   proposed process proves to be a powerful multi-criteria decision support
   tool for urban planners. It allows to identify and quantify the Pareto
   Front of competing urban target trade-offs at early design phases.
   Additionally, it visualizes them according to the boundary conditions of
   urban development. The input configurations of the obtained Pareto
   -solutions serve as a base of urban planning recommendations. In our
   case study, trees and photovoltaics prove to be good levers in the area
   of GWP optimal solutions. However, urban planners need to carefully
   coordinate inputs when aiming for a specific trade -off balance. The
   tool-chain and the simulation model offer further potential for
   investigating neighborhood typologies. Thereby, applicants can derive
   scalable guidance to support the sustainable transformation of the urban
   environment.},

Title = {Quantitative Carbon Emission Prediction Model to Limit Embodied Carbon
   from Major Building Materials in Multi-Story Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the largest contributor of carbon emissions in China, the building
   sector currently relies mostly on enterprises' own efforts to report
   carbon emissions, which usually results in challenges related to
   information transparency and workload for regulatory bodies, who play an
   otherwise vital role in controlling the building sector's carbon
   footprint. In this study, we established a novel regulatory model known
   as QCEPM (Quantitative Carbon Emission Prediction Model) by conducting
   multiple linear regression analysis using the quantities of concrete,
   rebar, and masonry structures as independent variables and the embodied
   carbon emissions of a building as the dependent variable. We processed
   the data in the detailed quantity list of 20 multi-story frame structure
   buildings and fed them to the QCEPM for the solution. Comparison of the
   QCEPM-calculated results against the time-consuming and error-prone
   manual calculation results suggested a mean absolute percentage error
   (MAPE) of 2.36\%. Using this simplified model, regulatory bodies can
   efficiently supervise the embodied carbon emissions in multi-story frame
   structures by setting up a carbon quota for a project in its approval
   stage, allowing the construction enterprise to carry out dynamic control
   over the three most important audited building materials throughout a
   project's planning and implementation phase.},

Title = {Statistical Methods in Bidding Decision Support for Construction
   Companies},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {On the border of two phases of a building life cycle (LC), the
   programming phase (conception and design) and the execution phase, a
   contractor is selected. A particularly appropriate method of selecting a
   contractor for the construction market is the tendering system. It is
   usually based on quality and price criteria. The latter may involve the
   price (namely, direct costs connected with works realization as well as
   mark-ups, mainly overhead costs and profit) or cost (based on the life
   cycle costing (LCC) method of cost efficiency). A contractor's decision
   to participate in a tender and to calculate a tender requires an
   investment of time and company resources. As this decision is often made
   in a limited time frame and based on the experience and subjective
   judgement of the contractor, a number of models have been proposed in
   the literature to support this process. The present paper proposes the
   use of statistical classification methods. The response obtained from
   the classification model is a recommendation to participate or not. A
   database consisting of historical data was used for the analyses. Two
   models were proposed: the LOG model-using logit regression and the LDA
   model-using linear discriminant analysis, which obtain better results.
   In the construction of the LDA model, the equation of the discriminant
   function was sought by indicating the statistically significant
   variables. For this purpose, the backward stepwise method was applied,
   where initially all input variables were introduced, namely, 15
   identified bidding factors, and then in subsequent steps, the least
   statistically significant variables were removed. Finally, six variables
   (factors) were identified that significantly discriminate between
   groups: type of works, contractual conditions, project value, need for
   work, possible participation of subcontractors, and the degree of
   difficulty of the works. The model proposed in this paper using a
   discriminant analysis with six input variables achieved good
   performance. The results obtained prove that it can be used in practice.
   It should be emphasized, however, that mathematical models cannot
   replace the decision-maker's thought process, but they can increase the
   effectiveness of the bidding decision.},

Abstract = {Efficient energy demand management in the residential sector must be
   designed based on a sufficient understanding of factors. This study
   focuses on apartments, a mainstream housing type in Korea. The
   combination of factor analysis and quantile regression analysis provides
   insight into the sociocultural meaning of home appliance ownership and

   eight representative home appliances closely related to electricity
   consumption in the household sector are related to household
   composition, life cycle, economic ability, education, and occupation
   type. Additionally, the influence of home appliances on electricity
   consumption is not constant and is differentiated depending on the
   consumption level of each household. These attempts can provide
   customized information on specific housing type groups emerging in the
   future economic development and urban development process. In
   residential energy demand management, further segmentation and
   specification of the target and content of information provision will
   increase the effectiveness of policy achievement.},

Title = {Multi-aspect analysis of measures to reduce the building `s energy
   demand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Issues related to reducing the energy demand of residential buildings
   are still relevant in the light of the energy transition and ongoing
   climate change. A single-family house from the early 1990s with a heated
   area of approximately 177 m 2 , located in the north-eastern part of
   Poland, was used as a case study. The article contains the results of
   nine years of measurements that included energy consumption for heating
   and domestic hot water preparation. It was estimated that the annual
   final energy consumption was 128.2 kWh/m 2 {[}462 MJ/m 2 ]. After
   insulating the building envelope and replacing the windows with
   triple-glazed ones, this value reduced to 68.2 kWh/m 2 {[}246 MJ/m 2 ].
   The measurement results were used to build a statistical model, based on
   multiple regression, to calculate the energy demand of a similar
   building to the one analysed in this article in any given location. The
   article presents the second, more advanced, energy simulations model
   made in the DesignBuilder environment, which enabled additional analysis
   of the operation of the heating and ventilation system. The scope of
   this study also included a multi-variant economic analysis of the
   building energy renovation, in which the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) , Net
   Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) values were
   determined.},

Abstract = {If a university building's performance fails to conform to what is
   required or anticipated, the engineer-of-record for the facility can be
   charged with negligence and may bear liability for damages arising from
   that failure. An engineer's negligence is assessed by arranging the
   engineer's actions relative to the standard maintenance cost and budget
   of the profession. This paper briefly describes the meaning and
   application of the standard of maintenance costs and budgets, and
   addresses the meaning of maintenance cost and budgeting with regard to
   engineering. To examine this issue, this paper presents a case study on
   the operation maintenance phase of 4 university buildings on the campus
   of National Taiwan University. Using historical data on maintenance and
   repair over a 42-year period, a cost prediction model using the
   life-cycle cost (LCC) was determined using three different methods: (I)
   simple linear regression (SLR); (2) multiple regression (MR); and
   finally (3) a back propagation artificial neural network (BPN). The
   research results showed that the BPN model had keen estimation ability.
   This paper implemented the BPN model in a case study to analyze the
   problems of maintenance costs and budgeting for university buildings.
   The paper helps to set a legitimate standard for arranging repair
   maintenance costs, and proposes a plan and standard for the repair
   maintenance strategy of structures.},

Abstract = {Intelligent machinery prognostics and health management (PHM) methods
   have been attracting growing attention in the past years, with the rapid
   development of the artificial intelligence algorithms. The remaining
   useful life (RUL) prediction problem is critical in prognostics for
   optimization of the maintenance strategy. Despite the promising
   advances, the current algorithms basically assume the training and
   testing entities are operating under identical condition, which is less
   practical in the real industries. In the cross-domain PHM studies,
   domain adaptation techniques have been successfully applied for building
   generalized data-driven models. However, the availability of
   target-domain data in full life cycle is basically required by the
   existing methods. In most scenarios, only the target data at early
   degradation period can be obtained, that poses great challenges in
   transfer learning. This article proposes a partial domain adaptation
   method for RUL prediction with incomplete target-domain data. Deep
   neural network-based adversarial learning strategy is adopted as the
   main framework, and the source-domain instance-weighted degradation
   fusion scheme is proposed for conditional domain adaptation at similar
   degradation levels. The source outliers can be well filtered out in
   learning generalized features across domains. Experiments of machine
   run-to-failure tests are implemented for validation, and the results
   indicate the proposed methodology is well suited for practical
   cross-domain RUL predictions.},

Abstract = {Imagine embarking on a long journey, only to realize that a smartphone
   charger or the smart LED display in front of your seat is not
   functional. Ensuring customer satisfaction is important in building a
   loyal customer base and making the customer feel satisfied about the
   quality of their journey. This paper probes a significant lacuna within
   the Indian Railways that pushes the onus on the passenger to report a
   problem and then follow it up until resolution. Myriad ways of reporting
   problems confuse travelers. This paper advocates collection of passenger
   comfort data thru a smart phone application. An initial categorization
   of the problem is explained followed by building an intelligent system
   that solves problems quickly. Smarter resolution, with active
   participation of onboard staff and ways to incentivize the passenger
   reporting the problem are suggested. Unique customer satisfaction
   metrics and factors affecting them with examples to apply in the
   railways are explored. Equipment failure data gathered via the app,
   could be integrated with asset management databases for predicted
   maintenance. Finally, a staged implementation plan is proposed that uses
   Machine Learning (ML) models for life cycle assessment of parts.},

Abstract = {Asset management of healthcare facilities utilizes technical and
   administrative strategies to extend the asset life cycle. This research
   aims to develop an asset condition assessment (ACA) model for a
   healthcare facility to predict and assess critical asset ratings
   considering various factors, especially patient risk space groups, and
   asset redundancy. Two modelling techniques were used to develop the ACA
   model. First, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate
   the weighting criteria and ranking the factors. Second, the AHP and
   regression analysis techniques were combined into a single model to
   evaluate healthcare facilities' asset condition assessment. The
   integrated model was validated with 88.32\% average validity percent
   (AVP). The model was determined to be robust, and its results
   satisfactory. Finally, this research developed a numerical asset
   condition assessment (ACA) critical rating scale, which can guide
   capital renewals leaders in predicting and managing healthcare
   facilities' critical infrastructure needs. Ultimately, this tool can be
   used to improve the asset management of healthcare facilities, which is
   one of the nation's largest infrastructure sectors.},

Abstract = {The paper presents some results of the research into a development of a
   cost estimating model that is capable of using information from building
   information model and implementing machine learning for cost prediction.
   Accurate estimates, provided throughout the whole construction project,
   allow for actual cost savings and assist in achieving sustainability
   goals. The model which is based on the support vector regression and
   radial basis kernel functions has been developed and proposed to support
   cost estimates of building's floor structural frames. The author's main
   assumption was to combine the benefits of building information modelling
   - namely the ability to extract certain information about the building
   and structural members of the floor frames from the models and the
   capabilities of machine learning. The research, presented in this paper,
   came down to solving a regression problem with the use of the support
   vectors approach. The training data for machine learning included inputs
   that represented features of the building and structural members'
   belonging to the floor structural frames and outputs that represented
   corresponding real life cost estimates of the floor structural frames.
   The obtained results show that the proposed model allows predicting
   costs with satisfactory accuracy.},

Title = {A Perspective on a Quality Management System for AI/ML-Based Clinical
   Decision Support in Hospital Care},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Although many artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
   based algorithms are being developed by researchers, only a small
   fraction has been implemented in clinical-decision support (CDS) systems
   for clinical care. Healthcare organizations experience significant
   barriers implementing AI/ML models for diagnostic, prognostic, and
   monitoring purposes. In this perspective, we delve into the numerous and
   diverse quality control measures and responsibilities that emerge when
   moving from AI/ML-model development in a research environment to
   deployment in clinical care. The Sleep-Well Baby project, a ML-based
   monitoring system, currently being tested at the neonatal intensive care
   unit of the University Medical Center Utrecht, serves as a use-case
   illustrating our personal learning journey in this field. We argue that,
   in addition to quality assurance measures taken by the manufacturer,
   user responsibilities should be embedded in a quality management system
   (QMS) that is focused on life-cycle management of AI/ML-CDS models in a
   medical routine care environment. Furthermore, we highlight the strong
   similarities between AI/ML-CDS models and in vitro diagnostic devices
   and propose to use ISO15189, the quality guideline for medical
   laboratories, as inspiration when building a QMS for AI/ML-CDS usage in
   the clinic. We finally envision a future in which healthcare
   institutions run or have access to a medical AI-lab that provides the
   necessary expertise and quality assurance for AI/ML-CDS implementation
   and applies a QMS that mimics the ISO15189 used in medical laboratories.},

Title = {Microclimate spatio-temporal prediction using deep learning and land use
   data},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {253},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Urban microclimate prediction is crucial for various fields, including
   Building Performance Simulation (BPS), outdoor thermal comfort, building
   life cycle, and residential health. Existing methods involve using
   classical weather file data, such as Typical Meteorological Years (TMY),
   or machine learning techniques for time-based forecasting. However, the
   incorporation of both spatial and temporal dimensions and land use/land
   cover (LULC) data is seldom considered. This paper proposes a novel
   approach to predict microclimate: the GeoLSTM-Kriging model, which is
   applicable for fine-scale microclimate prediction within a few hundred
   meters around weather stations. The Geo -layer processes and learns from
   LULC data, the LSTM layer learns from historical data, and the Kriging
   layer extracts spatial distance information. This comprehensive
   combination integrates spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions,
   providing accurate results with higher spatial resolution (1 m x 1 m)
   and shorter time intervals (10 min). These prediction results were
   achieved by employing statistical downscaling calculation and utilizing
   data from 14 weather stations located within our university campus. Upon
   the analysis of these prediction results, we found that the proposed
   model can accurately predict temperature and humidity at high spatial
   and temporal resolution. Compared to traditional interpolation models,
   the RMSE of temperature decreases from 1.59 degrees C to 0.64 degrees C,
   and the RMSE of relative humidity (RH) decreases from 7.70 to 3.23. A
   thorough analysis of the model prediction results reveals the varied
   impacts of different LULC features on microclimate predictions,
   highlighting the value of the proposed model and the importance of
   incorporating LULC data.},

Abstract = {Carbon mitigation in the building sector is crucial for China to fulfill
   its commitments towards achieving a carbon peak and carbon neutrality.
   However, the impact of societal development and ecological indicators on
   building carbon emissions remains unclear. This study employs the panel
   smooth transition regression model to investigate the complex
   implications of societal development comprehensive indicators,
   characterized by harmonious development, decoupling, and technological
   advances, on buildings' total carbon emissions, based on the evidence
   from China's 30 provinces for the period between 2007 and 2020.
   Additionally, the robustness of the model confirms that the conclusion
   is still valid. The empirical results indicate a strongly non-linear
   relationship between societal development comprehensive indicators and
   building carbon emissions. Both the harmonious development and
   technological advances exhibit two transition functions, and decoupling
   features a single transition function. Harmonious development is more
   sensitive to the impact of building carbon emissions, while
   technological advances have tremendous emission reduction potential.
   From the time dimension, fluctuation trends and ranges are different.
   From the spatial dimension, the inhibiting and promoting effects on each
   province have regional heterogeneity. Our results entail suggestions for
   reduced building total carbon emissions and practical strategies for
   regional climate resilience and efficiency in mitigating climate change.},

Abstract = {Occupants' satisfaction is becoming a more important issue in our modern
   competitive work system. Satisfaction is largely a state of mind
   depending on many different parameters. There are various strong
   evidences indicating that building characteristics and the quality of
   indoor environment significantly influence the level of satisfaction and
   efficiency of occupants in commercial buildings. In order to increase
   the overall satisfaction level, decision makers should face the
   challenge to identify and apply those strategies that have the highest
   probability to satisfy building occupants. While the benefits of
   occupants' satisfaction improvement are acknowledged, the impacts of
   different strategies and their expected results have not been
   quantitatively described. This paper presents a methodology for
   developing a quantitative model to measure the overall satisfaction of
   occupants in commercial buildings associated with indoor environment
   quality such as lighting, temperature satisfaction, etc. A survey is
   design to collect the associated data. In addition, three different
   models including simple multi-variate regression model, model based on
   the normalized averages of weightings, and refined normalized weightings
   have been developed to quantify the overall satisfaction of occupants.
   These models will help to identify the most influential factors
   affecting their satisfaction. In addition, a probability distribution of
   weighing for each aspect through the studied population is presented
   which will be a beneficial tool to estimate the outcomes of different
   strategies.},

Abstract = {In the construction sector, LCAs typically apply an approach based on
   fixed or partially fixed building lifespans/service lives/reference
   study period. The temporal scopes applied in building LCAs are hence
   typically not reflecting that the timeframes buildings can provide the
   service they are intended to provide, are (highly) dependent on numerous
   factors e.g.: building location, materials used to construct the
   building, energy supply and the use of the building. Inaccurate
   estimation of the temporal scope of a building LCA will lead to
   incorrect quantification of the environmental impacts of buildings.
   Incorrect quantification of the environmental performance of buildings
   may, in the worst case, derange/decelerate the development within the
   building sector towards more sustainable buildings. In this paper, a
   data set consisting of 20999 Danish buildings, demolished between 2009
   and 2015, is analyzed. A multiple linear regression model is derived and
   used to quantify the temporal scope (often referred to as the reference
   study period) of building LEAs in an attempt to improve the accuracy of
   sustainability assessment of buildings, taking several influencing
   factors into account. The results obtained from the derived model are
   subsequently compared with several fixed/partially fixed building
   lifespan/service life/reference study period quantification approaches
   The regression model proved to estimate the lifespan with lower errors
   (compared to observed values) than the prevailing approach relying on a
   single fixed value for all building locations, uses and building
   materials. The application of model based site, use, and/or material
   specific etc. temporal scope quantification in LCA is new and provides a
   mean to reduce the uncertainty of LCA results; however, the approach
   needs to he formalized. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Models capture relevant properties of systems. During the models'
   life-cycle, they are subjected to manipulations with different goals
   such as managing software evolution, performing analysis, increasing
   developers' productivity, and reducing human errors. Typically, these
   manipulation operations are implemented as model transformations.
   Examples of these transformations are (i) model-to-model transformations
   for model evolution, model refactoring, model merging, model migration,
   model refinement, etc., (ii) model-to-text transformations for code
   generation and (iii) text-to-model ones for reverse engineering. These
   operations are usually manually implemented, using general-purpose
   languages such as Java, or domain-specific languages (DSLs) such as ATL
   or Acceleo. Even when using such DSLs, transformations are still
   time-consuming and error-prone. We propose using the advances in
   artificial intelligence techniques to learn these manipulation
   operations on models and automate the process, freeing the developer
   from building specific pieces of code. In particular, our proposal is a
   generic neural network architecture suitable for heterogeneous model
   transformations. Our architecture comprises an encoder-decoder long
   short-term memory with an attention mechanism. It is fed with pairs of
   input-output examples and, once trained, given an input, automatically
   produces the expected output. We present the architecture and illustrate
   the feasibility and potential of our approach through its application in
   two main operations on models: model-to-model transformations and code
   generation. The results confirm that neural networks are able to
   faithfully learn how to perform these tasks as long as enough data are
   provided and no contradictory examples are given.},

Abstract = {With the acceleration of China's urbanization process, the importance of
   energy conservation and emission reduction in the building sector has
   become increasingly prominent. The effective control of carbon emissions
   in coastal provinces has a decisive impact on achieving the carbon
   emissions peak target nationwide. Based on the analysis of the
   influencing factors, this study establishes an urban residential
   buildings carbon emission prediction model by combining the IPAT model
   and the ridge regression model. In addition, the prediction model is
   combined with scenario analysis to simulate the evolution of carbon
   emission trends of urban residential buildings in Fujian Province from
   2018 to 2050 under different scenarios. The results show that total
   population, urban living area, residents' consumption expenditure,
   urbanization rate, per capita GDP, and energy structure are key factors
   affecting carbon emissions from urban residential buildings in coastal
   cities. Only under the ultra-low carbon model scenario can Fujian's
   urban residential buildings achieve the carbon peak goal in 2027
   (13.4748 million tons of CO2), which requires a reduction of 59.67\%
   compared to that under the baseline model scenario. This study can
   provide an effective reference for energy conservation and emission
   reduction work of the regional scale and even the national scale.},

Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the Hopsworks platform to the entire Earth
   Observation (EO) data community and the Copernicus programme. Hopsworks
   is a scalable data-intensive open-source Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   platform that was jointly developed by Logical Clocks and the KTH Royal
   Institute of Technology for building end-to-end Machine Learning
   (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) pipelines for EO data. It provides the full
   stack of services needed to manage the entire life cycle of data in ML.
   In particular, Hopsworks supports the development of horizontally
   scalable DL applications in notebooks and the operation of workflows to
   support those applications, including parallel data processing, model
   training, and model deployment at scale. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first work that demonstrates the services and features of
   the Hopsworks platform, which provide users with the means to build
   scalable end-to-end ML/DL pipelines for EO data, as well as support for
   the discovery and search for EO metadata. This paper serves as a
   demonstration and walkthrough of the stages of building a
   production-level model that includes data ingestion, data preparation,
   feature extraction, model training, model serving, and monitoring. To
   this end, we provide a practical example that demonstrates the
   aforementioned stages with real-world EO data and includes source code
   that implements the functionality of the platform. We also perform an
   experimental evaluation of two frameworks built on top of Hopsworks,
   namely Maggy and AutoAblation. We show that using Maggy for
   hyperparameter tuning results in roughly half the wall-clock time
   required to execute the same number of hyperparameter tuning trials
   using Spark while providing linear scalability as more workers are
   added. Furthermore, we demonstrate how AutoAblation facilitates the
   definition of ablation studies and enables the asynchronous parallel
   execution of ablation trials.},

Abstract = {Sustainability assessment (SA) has been one of the prime contributors to
   advanced manufacturing analysis, and it traditionally involves life
   cycle assessment (LCA) techniques for retrospective and prospective
   evaluations. One big challenge to reach a reliable sustainability
   assessment comes from the inadequate understandings of the underlying
   activities related to each of the product lifecycle stages based on
   expert knowledge. Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, is an
   emerging approach that takes advantage of machine-learning methods in
   building models that would complement or replace the knowledge-based
   models capturing physical behaviors. Incorporating suitable data
   analytics models to utilize real-time product and process data could
   significantly improve LCA techniques.
   To address the complexity and uncertainty involved in multilevel SA
   decision-making activities, this paper proposes a modular LCA framework
   to accommodate a hybrid modeling paradigm that includes knowledge-based
   and data-driven models. We identify and emphasize on two important
   challenges: (1) Generalizing knowledge-based and data-driven models into
   analytics models so that they can be uniformly deployed and
   interchanged, and (2) Modularizing the LCA decision logics and model
   structures so that the LCA decision process can be streamlined and
   easily maintained. The issues related to the decomposition,
   standardization, deployment and execution of analytics models are
   discussed in this paper. Three well-adopted standards -STEP (Standard
   for the Exchange of Product model data), DMN (Decision Model and
   Notation), and PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) are employed to
   capture the product-related data/information, the decision logic
   decomposition of analytics models, and the structure decomposition of
   analytics models, respectively.
   The feasibility and benefits of the proposed modular, hybrid
   sustainability assessment methodology have been illustrated with an
   injection molding case study, incorporating an overall modular
   Scorecard-based LCA architecture with a Bayesian Network predictive
   model.},

Abstract = {As the development platforms in software technology grow rapidly; the
   development of software systems has become more and more complex and
   versatile. It is quite necessary for the software industries to develop
   software products with good qualities. As the size of the product and
   development technologies increasing, there is need for identification of
   software defects at the early stage of development phase. Detection of
   defects appropriately and accurately measured in the early stage to
   increase the quality of the product. Software metric can be defined as
   building blocks of prediction models. The evaluation of software metric
   is carried out in the design and coding phase prior to actual
   implementation of the product. Defects are described as a type of
   conditions that does not satisfy minimum requirement and this can lead
   to malfunction or unexpected outcomes. The numbers of defects are
   inversely proportional with the quality which means, on decreasing
   numbers of defects will result better software quality. Detection of
   these defects at the early stage of development life cycle will reduce
   the cost and effort to a great extent. Since decades many researchers
   have proposed different models for detection of defects in software
   modules. In this paper we emphasized on defect detection approaches
   using machine learning scheme to improve true positive rate. Prediction
   metrics are basically split into two categories, those are:- code
   metrics and process metrics. In this paper we have designed and
   implemented a novel defect prediction model using probabilistic ABC
   based classification model. We compared our model with various defect
   detection approaches in terms of statistical measures. Experimental
   results proved that proposed model has high computational detection rate
   compared to traditional models.},

Abstract = {Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning,
   and scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability,
   and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework,
   composed of both a workflow and documentation, aims to provide
   responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results across the
   data science life cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a
   reality check and considers the importance of computation in data
   collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and
   computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands
   on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment
   calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm
   perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference
   procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis
   testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to
   problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and
   interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and
   genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its
   favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear
   model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models.
   Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter
   Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to
   back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and
   documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on
   Zenodo.},

Abstract = {Mapping websites and geo portals are playing a vital role in daily life
   due to the availability of geo-tagged data. From booking a cab to search
   a place, getting traffic information, review of the place, searching for
   a doctor or best school available in the locality, we are heavily
   dependent on the map services and geo portals available for finding such
   information. There is voluminous data available on these sources and it
   is getting increasing every moment. These data are majorly collected
   through crowdsourcing methods where people are contributing. As a basic
   principle of Garbage in garbage out, the quality of this data impacts
   the quality of the services based on this data. Therefore, it is highly
   desired to have a model which can predict the quality/accuracy of the
   geotagged Point of interest data. We propose a novel Fine-Tuned
   Predictive Model to check the accuracy of this data using the best
   suitable supervised machine learning approach. This work focuses on the
   complete life cycle of the model building, starting from the data
   collection to the fine-tuning of the hyperparameters. We covered the
   challenges particularly to the geotagged POI data and remedies to
   resolve the issues to make it suitable for predictive modeling for
   classifying the data based on their accuracy. This is a unique work that
   considers multiple sources including ground truth data to verify the
   geotagged data using a machine learning approach. After exhaustive
   experiments, we obtained the best values for hyperparameters for the
   selected predictive model built on the real data set prepared
   specifically to target the proposed solution. This work provides a way
   to develop a robust pipeline for predicting the accuracy of crowdsourced
   geotagged data.},

Title = {Service life prediction models for exterior stone cladding},
Journal = {BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {637-653},
Abstract = {The use of service life prediction tools can allow a more rational
   management of the maintenance of a building and its components by
   supporting reduced life cycle costs of constructed assets. A study was
   conducted to evaluate the degradation of facades of buildings located in
   Lisbon, Portugal, and in which visual in-situ inspections of 140 stone
   cladding facades were completed. Based on this information, different
   models were proposed to describe the degradation of masonry stone-clad
   buildings and a novel approach to predicting service life was developed.
   A description is provided for the use of artificial neural networks to
   predict the service life of stone cladding of the type that is directly
   adhered to a building substrate. With the use of artificial neural
   networks an analytical expression was established to estimate the
   degradation of this type of cladding system. The viability of this
   method was then compared with other methods used for service life
   prediction including multiple linear regression and a graphical method.
   Some of the statistical parameters used to assess the performance of the
   various methods are described. Of these three methods, those variables
   that best explain the degradation of stone cladding, are identified:
   cladding age, distance from the sea, type of finish, and size of the
   stone plates.},

Title = {Prediction of Highway Tunnel Pavement Performance Based on Digital Twin
   and Multiple Time Series Stacking},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {The existing pavement performance prediction methods are limited to
   single-factor predictions, which often face the challenges of high cost,
   low efficiency, and poor accuracy. It is difficult to simultaneously
   solve the temporal, spatial, and exogenous dependencies between pavement
   performance data and maintenance, the service life of highways, the
   environment, and other factors. Digital twin technology based on the
   building information modeling (BIM) model, combined with machine
   learning, puts forward a new perspective and method for the accurate and
   timely prediction of pavement performance. In this paper, we propose a
   highway tunnel pavement performance prediction approach based on a
   digital twin and multiple time series stacking (MTSS). This paper (1)
   establishes an MTSS prediction model with heterogeneous stacking of
   eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the artificial neural network
   (ANN), random forest (RF), ridge regression, and support vector
   regression (SVR) component learners after exploratory data analysis
   (EDA); (2) proposes a method based on multiple time series feature
   extraction to accurately predict the pavement performance change trend,
   using the highway segment as the minimum computing unit and considering
   multiple factors; (3) uses grid search with the k-fold cross validation
   method to optimize hyperparameters to ensure the robustness, stability,
   and generalization ability of the prediction model; and (4) constructs a
   digital twin for pavement performance prediction to realize the
   real-time dynamic evolution of prediction. The method proposed in this
   study is applied in the life cycle management of the Dalian
   highway-crossing tunnel in Shanghai, China. A dataset covering 2010-2019
   is collected for real-time prediction of the pavement performance. The
   prediction accuracy evaluation shows that the mean absolute error (MAE)
   is 0.1314, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.0386, the mean
   absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 5.10\%, and the accuracy is 94.90\%.
   Its overall performance is better than a single model. The results
   verify that the prediction method based on digital twin and MTSS is
   feasible and effective in the highway tunnel pavement performance
   prediction.},

Title = {Prediction and optimization of heating and cooling loads for low energy
   buildings in Morocco: An application of hybrid machine learning methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {61},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, a metamodel-based approach involving simulation data
   collection and data-driven techniques was used to forecast and optimize
   heating and cooling loads in three different climates in Morocco. The
   metamodel method is gaining popularity as it offers a better balance
   between accuracy and calculation time. In addition, a wrapper method was
   used as a feature selection approach to find the best feature subsets in
   order to reduce models' complexity. Therefore, the performances of
   eleven state-of-the-art algorithms including evolutionary-based
   algorithms, swarm intelligence-based algorithms and human-based
   algorithms, coupled with a learner such as Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs) and Support vector machine (SVM), were assessed. Hybrid model
   based on League championship algorithm (LCA), Discrete symbiotic
   organisms search (DSOS) algorithm, Particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm showed better results in terms of accuracy and reduction of
   feature input parameters. Indeed, the best desired performances were
   obtained with LCA-SVM for cooling load, DSOS-SVM for heating load,
   PSO-ANN for both heating and cooling loads. On the other hand, to
   optimize the annual thermal load, the NSGA-II algorithm was used.
   Results showed a reduction of 68\% of the total annual load compared to
   the base case in Meknes city, 73\% in Ifrane and 67\% in Marrakech. The
   solution that reflects a compromise between the two objective functions
   (i.e., cooling load and heating load) gives better results in terms of
   CO2 emissions reduction in all climates evaluated, except in the cold

Title = {Spatial Model for Energy Consumption of LEED-Certified Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this research endeavor, we undertook a comprehensive examination of
   the factors influencing the energy consumption of LEED-certified
   buildings, employing both a general linear regression model and a
   spatial delayed regression model. Gaining a profound understanding of
   energy utilization patterns within LEED-certified structures can
   significantly contribute to advancing eco-friendly construction
   practices. Our investigation draws upon data from a 2010 study conducted
   at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), encompassing various
   independent variables, such as temperature, that exhibit some degree of
   correlation with energy consumption in LEED-certified buildings. The
   principal objective of this study is twofold: firstly, to ascertain the
   significance of specific exogenous variables, notably temperature, and
   secondly, to explore the impact of spatial factors, such as function and
   location, on energy usage. Our research framework encompasses meticulous
   data collection and rigorous analysis, culminating in the presentation
   and discussion of our findings. Notably, our study unveils intriguing
   insights. Contrary to conventional assumptions, we discovered that the
   energy consumption of LEED-certified buildings does not exhibit a robust
   linear association with average annual temperature, the count of power
   plants within a 50 mile radius, or the LEED rating itself. However, our
   spatial regression models unveil a compelling narrative: the geographic
   distribution and functional diversity of distinct LEED buildings wield
   discernible influence over energy consumption patterns. The implications
   of our research resonate profoundly in the realm of LEED-certified
   building design and construction. Architects, builders, and stakeholders
   should consider the nuanced interplay of spatial variables and
   geographical positioning in the pursuit of optimal energy efficiency.
   Moreover, our findings stimulate further inquiry in this field, paving
   the way for future investigations aimed at refining sustainable building
   practices and enhancing our understanding of energy consumption within
   LEED-certified structures.},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is an important part of modern data science
   applications. Data scientists today have to manage the end-to-end ML
   life cycle that includes both model training and model serving, the
   latter of which is essential, as it makes their works available to
   end-users. Systems of model serving require high performance, low cost,
   and ease of management. Cloud providers are already offering model
   serving choices, including managed services and self-rented servers.
   Recently, serverless computing, whose advantages include high elasticity
   and a fine-grained cost model, brings another option for model serving.
   Our goal in this paper is to examine the viability of serverless as a
   mainstream model serving platform. To this end, we first conduct a
   comprehensive evaluation of the performance and cost of serverless
   against other model serving systems on Amazon Web Service and Google
   Cloud Platform. We find that serverless outperforms many cloud-based
   alternatives. Further, there are settings under which it even achieves
   better performance than GPU-based systems. Next, we present the design
   space of serverless model serving, which comprises multiple dimensions,
   including cloud platforms, serving runtimes, and other function-specific
   parameters. For each dimension, we analyze the impact of different
   choices and provide suggestions for data scientists to better utilize
   serverless model serving. Finally, we discuss challenges and
   opportunities in building a more practical serverless model serving
   system.},

Title = {Research on the green development path of prefabricated building
   industry based on intelligent technology},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 22},
Abstract = {PurposeIn order to make the construction industry develop in the
   direction of greening, this paper analyzes whether the application of
   intelligent technology in prefabricated buildings can achieve carbon
   emission reduction, starting from the problems of weak technology and
   insufficient encouragement policies in the prefabricated building
   industry. It also designs dynamic and adjustable incentives for the
   smart transformation of prefabricated buildings and makes
   recommendations to facilitate the transformation of assembly
   manufacturers into ``smart factories{''}.Design/methodology/approachThis
   paper takes the intelligent technology for carbon reduction, energy
   efficiency and policy design in the prefabricated buildings industry as
   the starting point. Based on in-depth expert interviews and
   questionnaire survey data, a linear multiple regression model is used to
   establish an association network of intelligent technology in the
   production and transportation, construction, operation and maintenance,
   demolition and scrapping stages. On this basis, an evolutionary game
   theory is used to construct a smart transformation and carbon reduction
   utility game model between the government and manufacturers, and
   relevant suggestions for smart empowerment of green construction
   development technology combinations and policy settings are
   proposed.FindingsAn assembly manufacturing plant with smart empowerment
   is an important way to achieve green and sustainable development in the
   construction industry. Among them, BIM and IoT have made a greater
   impact on carbon emission reduction of prefabricated buildings in all
   stages of the whole life cycle. The government's proposed energy
   efficiency incentives and environmental tax amount will effectively
   increase companies' motivation for smart transformation of prefabricated
   buildings. However, when the environmental tax amount is low, the
   government should strengthen the regulation of the industry in order to
   increase the speed of smart transformation of assembly manufacturers.
   Therefore, a reasonable setting of the environmental tax rate and
   energy-saving incentives and flexible adjustment of the regulatory
   efforts can maximize the functional utility of the government in the
   process of smart transformation.Research limitations/implicationsThis
   paper focuses on the impact of intelligent technologies on the overall
   carbon emissions of the industry and provides an evolutionary analysis
   of the strategic game between the government and assembly manufacturers,
   the main players in the smart transformation process of prefabricated
   buildings. However, smart technologies for different categories of
   assembly manufacturing plants and strategic options for a wider range of
   stakeholders have not been examined in depth.Originality/valueDifferent
   from existing research, this study focuses on exploring the strategic
   game between the government and assembly manufacturers in the smart
   transformation of prefabricated buildings. It provides an innovative
   explanation of the connection between intelligent technology and carbon
   emissions. The study develops an evolutionary game model for both
   parties, addressing the research gap on the combined effects of policy
   incentives and intelligent technology on carbon reduction and efficiency
   improvement in the prefabricated buildings industry.
   This research not only offers practical reference for the government in
   designing incentive mechanisms and establishing regulatory systems but
   also provides feasible practical guidance for the smart transformation
   and carbon reduction efforts of assembly manufacturing plants.},

Abstract = {Green buildings (GB) have been widely promoted in various nations.
   However, the post occupancy evaluation suggests many GB cannot well
   fulfill the expected targets. To overcome the mismatch among GB's
   multiobjectives, this paper develops an efficient and intelligent hybrid
   method using BIM-DesignBuilder (BIM-DB), Grey wolf optimization (GWO),
   random forest (RF) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   (NSGA-II) to achieve the optimization of design parameters. The BIM
   model and DB simulation tool were used to obtain data samples of
   envelope and air conditioning system design parameters, and their life
   cycle carbon emission (LCCE), economic cost (EC) and predicted mean vote
   (PMV). The RF model was used to achieve high precision prediction. The
   GWO was used in the hyper-parameter optimization. The NSGA-II algorithm
   was applied to multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal design
   parameters. A building case shows: (1) The RF model had an excellent
   prediction performance for LCCE, EC and PMV. (2) BIM-DB can be used to
   obtain low error and high reliability building simulation data sets. (3)
   The RF-NSGA-II intelligent algorithm can reduce the LCCE of the building
   in the entire cycle by 16.6\%, reduce the EC per square meter by 2.0\%,
   and greatly improve the thermal comfort by 18.3\%, representing good
   application value. This research provides a way of thinking for the
   multiobjective optimization of green buildings from the perspective of
   data mining and guidance for the parameter selection of the envelopes
   and air conditioning systems of new and existing buildings to more
   scientifically and effectively design green buildings.},

Title = {Predictive Modeling and Validation of Carbon Emissions from China's
   Coastal Construction Industry: A BO-XGBoost Ensemble Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The extensive carbon emissions produced throughout the life cycle of
   buildings have significant impacts on environmental sustainability.
   Addressing the Carbon Emissions from China's Construction Industry
   (CECI), this study uses panel data from seven coastal areas (2005-2020)
   and the Bayesian Optimization Extreme Gradient Boosting (BO-XGBoost)
   model to accurately predict carbon emissions. Initially, the carbon
   emission coefficient method is utilized to calculate the CECI.
   Subsequently, adopting the concept of a fixed-effects model to transform
   provincial differences into influencing factors, we employ a method
   combining Spearman rank correlation coefficients to filter out these
   influencing factors. Finally, the performance of the prediction model is
   validated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error
   (MAE), R-squared (R2) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The
   results indicate that the total CECI for the seven provinces and cities
   increased from 3.1 billion tons in 2005 to 17.2 billion tons in 2020,
   with Shandong Province having the highest CECI and Hainan Province
   having the lowest. The total population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
   and floor space of the buildings completed passed the significance test,
   among a total of eight factors. These factors can be considered
   explanatory variables for the CECI prediction model. The BO-XGBoost
   algorithm demonstrates outstanding predictive performance, achieving an
   R2 of 0.91. The proposed model enables potential decisions to
   quantitatively target the prominent factors contributing to the CECI.
   Its application can guide policymakers and decision makers toward
   implementing effective strategies for reducing carbon emissions, thereby
   fostering sustainable development in the construction industry.},

   of the approaches while referring to some relevant examples from the
   literature, this article focuses on critically analysing more approaches
   namely; 2D GIS and 3DGIS (CityGML) based energy prediction approaches,
   based on their frequent intervention scale, applicability in the
   building life cycle, and conventional prediction process. This will be
   followed by unravelling the gaps and issues pertaining to the reviewed
   approaches. Finally, based on the identified problems, future research
   prospects are recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Towards sustainable commercial buildings: an analysis of operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) costs in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {454-468},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Purpose Rising energy costs and increasing environmental concerns are
   catalysts for introducing sustainable design features in buildings.
   Incorporating sustainable design features in commercial buildings cannot
   be overstated because it could confer benefits to the investor (owners)
   and occupants. This study aims to develop a model that could aid in the
   prediction of operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs from the knowledge
   of building-design variables. There is little evidence that design
   variables influence the O\&M costs of buildings. Therefore, this study
   investigates the relationship between design variables and O\&M costs in
   commercial buildings with the intent of developing a cost model for
   estimating O\&M costs at the early design phase.
   Design/methodology/approach The study was approached quantitatively
   using a survey strategy. Data for the study were obtained from 30
   randomly selected commercial buildings in the CBD in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
   Pareto's 80/20 rule, correlation and regression analysis were performed
   on the data to prove the statistical relationships between the
   buildings' O\&M costs and their design variables. Findings The study
   found that 12 significant O\&M costs elements contribute to about 82\%
   of total O\&M costs. Repairs and decoration had a strong correlation
   with building shape. Furthermore, the regression analysis found that
   O\&M costs values were primarily dependent on the building size (the
   gross floor area and height of the buildings). The gross floor area and
   height handled over 73\% of the variance in the O\&M costs of commercial
   buildings in Sri Lanka. Originality/value These findings are a useful
   insight into the principles for design economies that could contribute
   to more sustainable commercial buildings.},

Title = {Does the energy efficiency of buildings bring price premiums? Evidence
   from urban micro-level energy data},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {181},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Energy efficient buildings can facilitate the achievement of sustainable
   development goals. However, higher investment costs are not conducive to
   the development of energy efficient buildings. It is not clear whether
   the energy efficiency of buildings (EEBs) bring price premiums that
   could offset the incremental costs of adopting green practice. In this
   paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is constructed that takes
   into account the differences in regional and urban size to measure the
   EEBs in 54 cities of China during 2007-2018. We evaluate the influence
   of EEBs on price premiums by using fixed effects regression. We then
   adopt a moderated mediation model to explore the impact of industrial
   structure and the regional economic development level on this pre-mium
   effect. The empirical results show that the cities' EEBs is gradually
   improving, due to the fact that the level of technical progress in
   residential construction is rising. A 1\% increase in house energy
   efficiency causes price premiums of 0.583\%. Moreover, this premium
   effect is more obvious in cities with a high proportion of tertiary
   industries and economically developed areas. Considering energy
   consumption in household heating, the housing prices expectations were
   pulled down in heating cities, while the situation was reversed in
   non-heating cities. This study provides companies and governments with
   scientific evidence to promote EEBs.},

Title = {Effect of window-to-wall ratio on measured energy consumption in US
   office buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {203},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Windows can significantly affect building performance, and the
   window-to-wall ratio (WWR) describes the portion of an exterior wall
   that consists of windows. Previous research on the effects of WWR and
   efforts to determine optimal WWR generally rely on iterative simulation
   or algorithmic optimization. This study seeks to understand the effects
   of WWR in actual office buildings using survey data reported in the 2012
   CBECS (Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey). Both total annual
   energy use and four discrete end-uses (heating, cooling, lighting and
   ventilation) were characterized, and 32 categorical and numerical
   building characteristic variables were selected for linear regression
   analysis. Descriptive statistics for energy use intensity (EUI) in
   similar to 1000 office buildings across 6 WWR intervals show increased
   median total EUI with increasing fenestration, driven by increasing
   cooling loads. Total EUI generally decreases with year of construction,
   regardless of WWR. Single-variable regression finds consistent
   statistical significance for WWR on cooling, lighting, and ventilation
   energy use, but with a maximum goodness of fit R-2 =0.04. In contrast,
   the single variable with the largest explanatory power is cooling degree
   days (R-2=0.22 for cooling energy use). Multi-regression modeling finds
   a maximum R-2 value of 0.34, with WWR appearing as a significant
   variable in the regression equations for cooling and lighting. In sum,
   the 2012 CBECS microdata for office buildings suggests that WWR is a
   significant predictor of energy use for cooling, and to a lesser extent
   lighting and ventilation, but to a much lower degree than has been found
   by purely simulation studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Platforms for Smart Environments and Future Internet Design: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {165748-165778},
Abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is pushing the integration of physical and
   virtual worlds. Sensor devices provide rich sensory information to
   context-aware services. Actuators implement in the physical world
   application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more
   resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is
   an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the
   humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for
   building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a
   review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this
   big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling,
   digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy,
   communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other
   aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on
   future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons.
   The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current
   initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future
   Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity
   come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important
   aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe
   model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the
   limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the
   relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet
   research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved;
   (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and
   SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many
   others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are
   missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future
   Internet-based.},

Title = {Empirical evidence, methodologies and perspectives on tourism, energy
   and sustainability: A systematic review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The high dependence of tourism activities on energy consumption, and
   particularly on non-renewable energy, is a major barrier to building
   sustainable tourism models. For this reason, the analysis of tourism and
   energy use is a growing field of study within sustainability debates.
   Despite this, there is a gap in the literature and, to the best of our
   knowledge, there is no previous study that critically reviews the vast
   literature on the energy-tourism nexus. This paper aims to fill this gap
   in tourism knowledge. The main objective of this article is to conduct a
   systematic review of scientific studies with a quantitative empirical
   basis that examine this nexus, trying to answer the following questions:
   What are the main methodologies used to approach the tourism-energy
   nexus? which indicators or variables are relevant?; is there a consensus
   on the results?; and what are the main lines of discussion on the use of
   energy in tourism? To this end, we particularly focus on the main
   methodologies, results and perspectives during the period 2001-2021. A
   total of 1,189 articles were reviewed by abstract and title, 236 were
   included for the full review and 163 were finally selected. The results
   show how the nexus and energy dependence of tourism is assessed mainly
   from four major methodological groups: G1) econometric models,
   regressions and other statistical methodologies (67\% of the sample);
   G2) surveys, questionnaires and energy audits (15\%); G3) Life Cycle
   Analysis (13\%) and G4) other approaches and environmental impact
   indicators to assess the relationship between energy and tourism (5\%).
   The analysis between the causal relationships between tourism
   development, economic growth, energy use, environmental degradation and
   energy efficiency of accommodations are the main issues evaluated,
   considering a wide range of indicators/variables. Based on the gaps and
   limitations found in the literature review on tourism and energy, it is
   discussed how some findings should be interpreted with caution due to
   their methodological approaches and differences. Finally, some of the
   main lines of future research in this field are also presented.},

Abstract = {The building sector is one of the biggest consumers of electricity in
   India. Climate change and global warming, as one of the most serious
   risks to human societies, are inextricably linked to energy usage and
   Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). With a population of nearly 1.38
   billion, India is the world's second largest country. The majority of
   Indian urbanization is involuted rather than evolved. Between 1991 and
   2011, the urban population expanded by 73 percent, from 217 million to
   377 million, while energy demand more than doubled from 1990 to 2009.
   GRIHA - Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment is an indigenous
   building rating system developed by Ministry of New and Renewable
   Energy, Govt. of India. GRIHA is a rating system that compares the
   building's performance to nationally accepted benchmarks. It assesses a
   building's environmental performance over the course of its full life
   cycle. With annual electricity consumption data for both residential and
   commercial sectors of India, with the linear regression methodology, the
   electricity demand till the year 2050 was plotted. Similarly, using the
   data from the GRIHA council and the Reference Building model, the annual
   electricity savings for GRIHA certified buildings has been plotted.
   Using non-linear regression, the savings for the years 2030 and 2050,
   has been plotted. The results show a positive indication that with
   stricter implementation of the energy conservation policies similar to
   GRIHA, by the govt of India, there can be significant savings in the
   energy Sector. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the factors of interregional migration in Russia for
   people of different ages. Basing on 2010 census data, we estimate
   negative binomial regression models for total migration flows and
   migration flows disaggregated by age with socio-economic, demographic,
   geographical factors of the regions of departure and arrival. The
   analysis showed that only two flows: migrants of economically active age
   and families react correctly (from an economic point of view) to the
   variables of the labor market, incomes, the economic situation of the
   regions of departure and arrival, and housing indicators. Pensioners
   tend to minimize the costs of living, moving to poorer regions with high
   unemployment, where the cost of living is cheaper, and to regions with a
   favorable climate, thus saving on housing maintenance and having
   opportunity for subsistence farming. Students and young people are
   rational in their relocation in a different way, they are motivated by
   the possibility of building up human capital and opportunities for
   starting a career, while other factors are insignificant for them. The
   study also confirmed the hypothesis that in Russia, as in other
   countries, migrant flows of different ages move in opposite directions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an informatics framework to apply feature-based
   engineering concept for cost estimation supported with data mining
   algorithms. The purpose of this research work is to provide a practical
   procedure for more accurate cost estimation by using the commonly
   available manufacturing process data associated with ERP systems. The
   proposed method combines linear regression and data-mining techniques,
   leverages the unique strengths of the both, and creates a mechanism to
   discover cost features. The final estimation function takes the user's
   confidence level over each member technique into consideration such that
   the application of the method can phase in gradually in reality by
   building up the data mining capability. A case study demonstrates the
   proposed framework and compares the results from empirical cost
   prediction and data mining. The case study results indicate that the
   combined method is flexible and promising for determining the costs of
   the example welding features. With the result comparison between the
   empirical prediction and five different data mining algorithms, the ANN
   algorithm shows to be the most accurate for welding operations. (C) 2015

Title = {Artificial intelligence exploitation in facility management using deep
   learning},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {609-624},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to apply a methodology that is capable to classify and
   localize mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) elements to assist
   facility managers. Furthermore, it assists in decreasing the technical
   complexity and sophistication of different systems to the facility
   management (FM) team.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research exploits artificial intelligence (AI) in FM operations
   through proposing a new system that uses a deep learning pre-trained
   model for transfer learning. The model can identify new MEP elements
   through image classification with a deep convolutional neural network
   using a support vector machine (SVM) technique under supervised
   learning. Also, an expert system is developed and integrated with an
   Android application to the proposed system to identify the required
   maintenance for the identified elements. FM team can reach the
   identified assets with bluetooth tracker devices to perform the required
   maintenance.
   Findings
   The proposed system aids facility managers in their tasks and decreases
   the maintenance costs of facilities by maintaining, upgrading, operating
   assets cost-effectively using the proposed system.
   Research limitations/implications
   The paper considers three fire protection systems for proactive
   maintenance, where other structural or architectural systems can also
   significantly affect the level of service and cost expensive repairs and
   maintenance. Also, the proposed system relies on different platforms
   that required to be consolidated for facility technicians and managers
   end-users. Therefore, the authors will consider these limitations and
   expand the study as a case study in future work.
   Originality/value
   This paper assists in a proactive manner to decrease the lack of
   knowledge of the required maintenance to MEP elements that leads to a
   lower life cycle cost. These MEP elements have a big share in the
   operation and maintenance costs of building facilities.},

Title = {Discussion on the effects of carbon trading for construction-related
   activities based on hybrid defuzzification strategy},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {412-439},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper constructs and develops a bi-layer programming model (BPM) in
   order to validate the various advantages of combining
   construction-related activities (CRAs) with carbon trading mechanisms
   under uncertainty. Besides, a hybrid defuzzification strategy (HDS) is
   applied to manage the uncertainties; for example, the uncertainties
   regarding with carbon price are mitigated bymachine learning. Aswell,
   the uncertainties surrounding construction-related costs and carbon
   emissions are quantified by introducing the subjective risk propensity
   of decision makers. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the HDS is
   demonstrated with sensitivity indicators by conducting simulations in
   different scenarios based on real data. The results show that carbon
   trading can cut emissions from CRAs by up to 31.9234 \%, 8.1393 \%, and
   8.7023 \% during procurement, transportation, and usage respectively,
   while lowering the costs by up to 0.9866 \%, 0.2004 \%, and 1.1267 \%
   respectively. While carbon trading can effectively facilitate emission
   reduction from CRAs, the profits are not burdened. Furthermore, the key
   factors in the green transition process of CRAs are summarized, and it
   is argued that the implementation of carbon trading can lead to higher
   affordability of CRAs. Finally, the paper suggests that the level of
   carbon prices affects the schedule of CRAs, with higher construction
   desire in periods of low carbon prices. (c) 2022 Institution of Chemical

Title = {Active Learning for Well Control Optimization with Surrogate Models},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2668-2688},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Optimization of well controls in waterflooding operations has been
   established as an effective strategy to increase oil recovery efficiency
   and to reduce operating costs. Optimization problems, however, entail
   hundreds of full -scale reservoir simulation runs, which can be
   computationally expensive and impractical for field -scale applications.
   Fit- for-purpose surrogate models present more efficient alternatives
   that can be deployed for faster implementation and to enable real-time
   applications. In recent years, machine learning (ML) -based surrogate
   models have gained traction in building efficient proxy models to
   facilitate reservoir engineering and management workflows. For
   high-dimensional control variables that are frequently encountered in
   life cycle optimization, gradient -based local search methods have
   proven to be the optimization algorithms of choice, especially when
   adjoint models are available to provide the required gradient
   information in a computationally efficient manner. The use of local
   search optimization techniques implies that the surrogate models should
   be locally accurate and adapted to the optimization path that is
   traversed during the iterations. The adaptation can be accomplished
   through active learning, where the training of the surrogate model is
   performed online (throughout the iterations) and tied to the
   optimtization iterations. This paper presents an active learning
   framework that is tuned to the local search nature of the optimization
   problem by updating an initially trained surrogate model based on new
   samples that are generated during the optimization iterations.
   Specifically, at each iteration, the full reservoir simulation model is
   performed to evaluate the true objective function and provide the new
   simulated data to update the surrogate model, thereby enhancing its
   local prediction accuracy. As the optimization progresses, older samples
   that become less relevant to the solution at the current iteration are
   dropped to preserve the local nature of the surrogate model. Various
   aspects of designing an active learning -based proxy model for well
   control optimization are discussed and the framework is applied to
   waterflooding problems to demonstrate its efficiency and superior
   performance compared to the traditional offline training approach.},

Abstract = {In recent years, and despite the effects of the economic crisis in the
   building sector, technicians involved in the architectural process had
   to adapt themselves to many changes, in search of new job opportunities.
   In this situation, traditional methods imposed by computer-aided design
   (CAD) in the development of new projects have evolved towards the use of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodologies, enabling the control
   of different aspects such as the design, construction and monitoring of
   a building; the implementation of this new approach has meant essential
   updating of construction professionals towards a new global coordination
   paradigm throughout the complete life cycle of a building. In order to
   analyse these demanded skills acquired by technicians with previous
   experience both in traditional CAD systems and BIM environments, a study
   has been carried out to determine (by comparison) the outstanding
   aspects about the use of BIM systems, taking into account the modelling
   process. To do so, a simple practical exercise of modelling using both
   AutoCAD and Revit software has been carried out with the participation
   of students and professionals within the building sector. Necessary data
   were obtained and later evaluated through simple regression considering
   the time dedicated to the modelling resolution; also, different variance
   analyses were conducted to identify alterations between the different
   categories and groups considered, taking into account factors such as
   gender, having a previous university degree or not, years of experience
   with CAD or BIM software, type of academic qualifications or having
   attended previous training courses (among others).},

   manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT),
   machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and
   cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building
   sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their
   functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends,
   challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that
   digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible,
   energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource
   utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing
   environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real -time data
   collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances
   energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30\%
   -50\% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040.
   While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of
   improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several
   challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks
   associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer
   awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations
   are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the
   adoption of digital technologies.},

Abstract = {Although smart farms are considered an alternative to traditional
   agriculture, they require large amounts of energy and high investment
   costs, hindering their efficient implementation. In the Republic of
   Korea, the energy supply is primarily for heating rather than cooling,
   necessitating the accurate prediction of the greenhouse internal
   temperature to determine the feasibility of agricultural management
   while using renewable energy. This study developed a model (TRNSYS) for
   predicting the internal temperature of a greenhouse using building
   energy simulation. A greenhouse heating experiment was conducted using a
   hybrid heating system simulated by TRNSYS to analyze the prediction
   model. The regression analysis of the experimental and simulation
   results revealed an R-2 and RMSE of 0.8834 and 3.61, respectively. A
   comparative analysis was conducted with the existing hot air heating
   system to evaluate the heating performance and economic feasibility of
   the hybrid system. Overall, the heating performance exhibited
   satisfactory results, whereas the economic analysis, based on life cycle
   cost, revealed a cost reduction effect of 9.45\%. Hence, greenhouse
   heating using renewable energy can replace conventional fossil fuels
   with economic advantages. Moreover, the prediction of the internal
   temperature of the greenhouse will facilitate the design of a systematic
   smart farm business to prevent duplicate investment.},

Title = {ANNEXE: An open-source building energy design optimisation framework
   using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {371},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {It is expected that the building sector will be a major contributor to
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as end-use services such as cooling
   demand is expected to rise significantly. Building energy design
   optimisation, applied either for new buildings or refurbishments, is a
   critical approach to achieve sustainable and adaptable cities, reducing
   sectoral emissions and increasing occupant's life quality. However, the
   design optimisation process has been characterised by following outdated
   approaches, mostly using physics-based thermal models and stochastic
   optimisation tools with large computational requirements. In addition,
   physics-based simulation tools still lack appropriate thermodynamic
   analysis which limits the potential to reduce actual energy
   inefficiencies in building energy systems. This paper introduces the
   ANNEXE (Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and EXErgy-based surrogate
   modelling) building design optimisation framework. Presented as an
   open-source tool, the framework proposes the integration of exergy
   analysis to improve building energy efficiency, combined with an
   efficient two-stage optimisation process allowing to initially optimise
   hyperparameters from data-driven ANN surrogate models using an Auto
   Machine Learning (AutoML) approach. Later, the near optimal building
   design parameters can be found in the second optimisation stage. A house
   building case study is presented to illustrate the applicability and
   validity of the proposed framework. The application of the framework and
   the obtained results have been compared to outputs from a typical
   optimisation approach based on physics-based energy simulations. It was
   found that the proposed approach was able to find similar Pareto
   solutions while reducing computational times by 98\%. Compared to the
   baseline, the optimal design resulted in an increase of 27\% in life
   cycle cost (50 years) but improving thermodynamic efficiency by reducing
   26\% of exergy destructions while decreasing annual thermal discomfort
   from 17\% to about 5\% annually. The results reveal that the proposed
   method provides a robust surrogate-based optimisation framework for
   designers and decision makers that could be applied to other energy
   research areas.},

Abstract = {Due to increasing pressure for energy saving and emission reduction,
   Chinese apartment developers have initiated sustainable design
   practices. This paper develops a conceptual model which proposes that
   cooperation with construction stakeholders and customers is a mediator,
   necessary for apartment developers to realize environmental, economic
   and even competitive performance improvement through sustainable design
   practices. The paper examines the current practice situations of
   sustainable design, cooperation with construction stakeholders and
   customers as well as related performance improvement among Chinese
   apartment developers based on 92 questionnaires conducted by the
   authors. The mediation effects are further analysed through hierarchical
   regression analysis. Statistical results indicate that sustainable
   design should be further promoted by the Chinese governments and
   implemented by Chinese apartment developers. Policy implications are
   discussed to provide detailed suggestions on improving the cooperation
   with Chinese apartment developers and their construction
   stakeholders/customers. Such cooperation can help apartment developers
   to improve environmental, competitive and economic performance through
   sustainable design practices. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd

Title = {Equations for early-stage design embodied carbon estimation for concrete
   floors of varying loading and strength},
Journal = {ENGINEERING STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {301},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Building designers are increasingly tasked with tracking and reducing
   the embodied carbon of structural systems, including concrete floor
   slabs. Design decisions that affect both the structural performance and
   the embodied carbon of a concrete floor are often made in the early
   design stages without complete structural analyses and life cycle
   assessments, which are commonly finalized in later stages. In this
   study, we employ polynomial regression models to estimate the embodied
   carbon for ten concrete floors to guide practitioners toward
   environmentally -informed design decisions. Six reinforced concrete (RC)
   and four post-tensioned (PT) floors are evaluated with varying five
   structural parameters including the span length, concrete strength, live
   and dead loads, and deflection limit, equating to 41,328 design
   scenarios for the RC systems and 27,552 design scenarios for the PT
   systems, while also considering 32,440 different concrete mix
   Environmental Product Declarations. The analytical equations are
   deployed in a web-app intended for practitioners to quickly evaluate and
   compare different design scenarios and floors. By estimating the
   embodied carbon of concrete floors while accounting for design and
   material uncertainty, these equations are ready for immediate use to
   reduce the carbon footprint of future buildings.},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) lifecycle is a cyclic process to build an
   efficient ML system. Though a lot of commercial and community
   (non-commercial) frameworks have been proposed to streamline the major
   stages in the ML lifecycle, they are normally overqualified and
   insufficient for an ML system in its nascent phase. Driven by real-world
   experience in building and maintaining ML systems, we find that it is
   more efficient to initialize the major stages of ML lifecycle first for
   trial and error, followed by the extension of specific stages to
   acclimatize towards more complex scenarios. For this, we introduce a
   simple yet flexible framework, MLife, for fast ML lifecycle
   initialization. This is built on the fact that data flow in MLife is in
   a closed loop driven by badcases, especially those which impact ML model
   performance the most but also provide the most value for further ML
   model development - a key factor towards enabling enterprises to fast
   track their ML capabilities.},

Abstract = {Most existing research on the prediction of bearing remaining useful
   life (RUL) focus on building a whole-lifecycle degradation model, which
   may affect prediction performance due to different states during the
   bearing degradation process. In addition, traditional network models
   such as CNN and RNN have limitations in directly dealing with time
   series problems. This paper proposes an adaptive degradation stage
   division strategy and a temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based RUL
   piecewise estimation method, called ADSD-TCNPE. This method mainly
   includes three steps. (1) Extract features from different domains and
   select the features that are highly correlated with bearing degradation.
   (2) Adaptively divide the whole lifecycle of bearing into different
   degradation stages. (3) Establish a TCN-based piecewise degradation
   model for different degradation stages to accurately predict bearing
   RUL. Finally, experimental verification and result analysis demonstrate
   the effec-tiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning and the proliferation of edge
   computing have enabled manufacturing industry to integrate machine
   learning into its operation to boost productivity. In addition to
   building high performing machine learning models, stakeholders and
   infrastructures within the industry should be taken into an account in
   building an operational lifecycle. In this paper, a practical machine
   learning operation scheme to build the vision inspection process is
   proposed, which is mainly motivated from field experiences in applying
   the system in large scale corporate manufacturing plants. We evaluate
   our scheme in four defect inspection lines in production. The results
   show that deep neural network models outperform existing algorithms and
   the scheme is easily extensible to other manufacturing processes.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 has brought us unprecedented difficulties and thousands of
   companies have closed down. The general public has responded to call of
   the government to stay at home. Offline retail stores have been severely
   affected. Therefore, in order to transform a traditional offline sales
   model to the B2C model and to improve the shopping experience, this
   study aims to utilize historical sales data for exploring, building
   sales prediction and recommendation models. A novel data science
   life-cycle and process model with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)
   analysis method with the combination of various analytics algorithms are
   utilized in this study for sales prediction and product recommendation
   through user behavior analytics. RFM analysis method is utilized for
   segmenting customer levels in the company to identify the importance of
   each level. For the purchase prediction model, XGBoost and Random Forest
   machine learning algorithms are used to build prediction models and
   5-fold Cross-Validation method is utilized to evaluate their. For the
   product recommendation model, the association rules theory and Apriori
   algorithm are used to complete basket analysis and recommend products
   according to the outcomes. Moreover, some suggestions are proposed for
   the marketing department according to the outcomes. Overall, the XGBoost
   model achieved better performance and better accuracy with F1-score
   around 0.789. The proposed recommendation model provides good
   recommendation results and sales combinations for improving sales and
   market responsiveness. Furthermore, it recommend specific products to
   new customers. This study offered a very practical and useful business
   transformation case that assists companies in similar situations to
   transform their business models.},

Abstract = {We are building a 3D description of upper tropospheric (UT) cloud
   systems in order to study the relation between convection and cirrus
   anvils. For this purpose we used cloud data from the Atmospheric
   InfraRed Sounder and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer
   and atmospheric and surface properties from the meteorological
   reanalyses ERA-Interim and machine learning techniques. The different
   artificial neural network models were trained on collocated radar-lidar
   data from the A-Train in order to add cloud top height, cloud vertical
   extent and cloud layering, as well as a rain intensity classification to
   describe the UT cloud systems. The latter has an accuracy of about 65 \%
   to 70 \% and allows us to build objects of strong precipitation, used to
   identify convective organization. This rain intensity classification is
   more efficient to detect large latent heating than cold cloud
   temperature. In combination with a cloud system analysis, we found that
   deeper convection leads to larger heavy rain areas and a larger
   detrainment, with a slightly smaller thick anvil emissivity. This kind
   of analysis can be used for a process-oriented evaluation of convective
   precipitation parameterizations in climate models. Furthermore, we have
   shown the usefulness of our data to investigate tropical convective
   organization metrics. A comparison of different tropical convective
   organization indices and proxies to define convective areas has revealed
   that all indices show a similar annual cycle in convective organization,
   in phase with convective core height and anvil detrainment. The
   geographical patterns and magnitudes in radiative heating rate
   interannual changes with respect to one specific convective organization
   index (Iorg) for the period 2008 to 2018 are similar to the ones related
   to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, since the interannual
   anomalies of the convective organization indices are very small and
   noisy, it was impossible to find a coherent relationship with those of
   other tropical mean variables such as surface temperature, thin cirrus
   area or subsidence area.},

Title = {A Review of Data-Driven Methods in Building Retrofit and Performance
   Optimization: From the Perspective of Carbon Emission Reductions},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In order to reduce the contribution of the building sector to global
   greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, it is important to improve
   the building performance through retrofits from the perspective of
   carbon emission reductions. Data-driven methods are now widely used in
   building retrofit research. To better apply data-driven techniques in
   low-carbon building retrofits, a better understanding is needed of the
   connections and interactions in optimization objectives and parameters,
   as well as optimization methods and tools. This paper provides a
   bibliometric analysis of selected 45 studies, summarizes current
   research hotspots in the field, discusses gaps to be filled, and
   proposes potential directions for future work. The results show that (1)
   the building-performance optimization (BPO) process established through
   physical simulation methods combines the site, retrofit variables, and
   carbon-related objectives, and the generated datasets are either
   directly processed using multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms
   or trained as a surrogate model and iteratively optimized using MOO
   methods. When a sufficient amount of data is available, data-driven
   methods can be used to develop mathematical models and use MOO methods
   for performance optimization from the perspective of building carbon
   emission reductions. (2) The benefits of retrofits are maximized by
   holistically taking environmental, economic, and social factors into
   account; from the perspectives of carbon emissions, costs, thermal
   comfort, and more, widely adopted strategies include improving the
   thermal performance of building envelopes, regulating HVAC systems, and
   utilizing renewable energy. (3) The optimization process based on
   data-driven methods, such as optimization algorithms and machine
   learning, apply mathematical models and methods for automatic iterative
   calculations and screen out the optimal solutions with computer
   assistance with high efficiency while ensuring accuracy. (4) Only 2.2\%
   and 6.7\% of the literature focus on the impacts of human behavior and
   climate change on building retrofits, respectively. In the future, it is
   necessary to give further consideration to user behaviors and long-term
   climate change in the retrofit process, in addition to improving the
   accuracy of optimization models and exploring the generalization and
   migration capabilities of surrogate models.},

Title = {Measuring perception about sustainability of building materials in
   Kosovo},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {7-8, SI},
Pages = {436-461},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop the empirically tested
   framework about the knowledge and perception about sustainability of
   building materials in Prishtina, Kosovo from the perspective of users,
   construction industry and facility managers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey of representative sections of the
   population was designed and carried out in the capital city of Kosovo to
   determine the knowledge and perception of the population about the
   sustainability of building materials and to determine the main criteria
   of selection of sustainable building materials. The study may be used as
   guidelines for sustainable real estate developers in Prishtina during
   the materials selection process. Qualitative interviews were conducted
   with architects, consulting engineering companies, construction
   companies and facility managers from the region of Prishtina with
   open-ended questions also being used.
   Findings - Results of quantitative research find that embodied energy,
   durability and low energy consumption are used as key criteria that
   influence the materials selection process on the part of users. The
   results of the cross-case analysis of qualitative measure the
   perceptions of construction industry and facility managers, according to
   which durability to a large degree is the main criterion for selection
   of sustainable building materials followed by embodied energy and low
   energy consumption.
   Research limitations/implications - The study of measurement of level of
   knowledge and perception about sustainability of building materials in
   Kosovo focuses only on one pilot city; hence, further research is needed
   throughout Kosovo to validate the empirically tested tool within other
   geographical settings in Kosovo.
   Originality/value - This survey represents the first quantification of
   knowledge and perception regarding the sustainability of building
   materials among users, construction sector and facility managers.},

Title = {Investigations of Building-Related LCC Sensitivity of a Cost-Effective
   Renovation Package by One-at-a-Time and Monte Carlo Parameter Variation
   Methods},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) is becoming a standard for new and
   renovated buildings throughout the European Union (EU). Through the
   ongoing implementation of directives related to energy efficiency and
   NZEB-compliant buildings, the EU commission has established that new and
   renovated NZEB-compliant buildings shall be implemented
   cost-effectively. This is assessed by linking the Life Cycle Cost (LCC)
   and energy demand calculations, representing them in a cost-optimality
   plot, and finding the optimal solution from the resulting Pareto front.
   Given that the results of an LCC calculation are quite dependent on the
   calculation model's scope and inputs, this study takes an explorative
   approach to determine the most influential parameters in LCC
   calculations for a pre-selected cost-effective package. This is achieved
   by varying the inputs using local and global variation methods. The
   local variation approach consists of varying the inputs one-at-a-time
   (OAT), whereas with global variation, all the selected inputs are
   variated simultaneously. The OAT approach identified the amount and unit
   cost of the utility supply (district heating, electricity, and gas) as
   the most influential parameters to the output. The OAT results were
   further used to rank the next five most sensitive parameters and perform
   a global sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. A
   regression analysis of the MC results revealed high R2 values (>= 0.98),
   suggesting a linear correlation between the output and the variable
   inputs. The sensitivity analysis determined the unit price of attic
   insulation, the gas price, and the lifetime of the Heat Pump (HP) as the
   most sensitive parameters in the three investigated models.},

Title = {Age Structure and Carbon Emission with Climate-Extended STIRPAT Model-A
   Cross-Country Analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Most of the existing carbon emission studies based on the IPAT framework
   considered the size effect rather than structure effect of population.
   However, it is proved with the micro-data household evidence that the
   demographic structure explains the unexpected trends better. To complete
   the framework, this study integrated the structure effects with the
   STIRPAT model base on the household life-cycle consumption theory as
   different age groups differ in carbon consumption behaviors. For further
   analysis with the frequent extreme weather events caused by global
   warming and their catastrophic effect on human activities, this study
   also harmonized Koppen criteria with the theories model by Syukuro
   Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann and considers climate factors precipitation
   (PRE), annual degree-day (DD), and temperature anomaly (TA) with the
   extended model to investigate whether population aging trend provides
   room for or creates barriers to carbon reduction. NASA night-time light
   (NTL) data DMSP/OLS and VIIRS/DNB is adopted as the proxy for population
   density to weight the relevant climate data from over 30,000 weather
   stations worldwide. The combined dataset is from 150 countries, and the
   period is during 1970-2013. The Panel Seemingly Unrelated Regression
   (SUR) method is used to solve the problems of cross-sectional
   correlation, non-stationarity, and endogeneity since sample countries
   are closely linked in the global meteorological system which make each
   cross-sectional disturbance term likely to be contemporaneously
   correlated, and endogeneity of carbon emission under the same global
   agreement constraint. The empirical results show that the age structure
   had significant and different impacts on carbon emissions. The general
   influence of age growth is an inverted U shape as the younger group
   consumes less than the older group, and offspring leave the family when
   the householder turns 50. The EKC theory is also checked with the
   threshold model of per capita income on carbon emissions to determine
   how many countries reached carbon peak. This study proved that the
   aggregated carbon consumption pattern is aligned with the microlevel
   evidence on household energy consumption. Another distinguished finding
   is that population aging may generally lead to an increase in heat and
   electricity carbon emissions, contrary to what some household energy
   consumption models would predict. We explain the uplifted tail as the
   ``effect caused by the narrowed adaptation temperature range{''} when
   people are getting older and vulnerable. It should be noted that as the
   aging trend becomes severe worldwide and extreme weather events happen
   with higher frequency, the potential energy spending and thus carbon
   emission on air conditioning will undoubtfully overgrow. One important
   method is to improve the building energy efficiency by retrofitting old
   buildings' insulations. Implementing new green building standards in
   carbon reduction must not be ignored. Evidence shows that if the
   insulation of pre-1990s houses is reconstructed with modern materials,
   carbon emissions caused by residential cooling and heating can be
   reduced by about 20\% every year. Overall, promoting an efficient
   building style provides reduction capacity for the industrial sector,
   and it is a way to achieve sustainable growth.},

Title = {The utilization of ammonia soda residue in building materials: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Ammonia soda residue (ASR) is the waste generated from the production of
   soda ash (Na2CO3) using the ammonia-soda process, with rarely reused and
   commonly stored in the storage facilities of soda plants, not only
   causes environmental contamination, land-occupying, and resourcewasting
   but also poses threats to the sustainable development of soda plants.
   Based on analyzed the generation and physicochemical properties of ASR,
   this paper provided a comprehensive review and summary of its
   applications in building materials, including cementitious materials,
   bricks, and road base materials. Additionally, the risks and challenges
   associated with the reuse of ASR in construction materials were also
   examined. The findings indicate that ASR has the advantages of strong
   alkalinity, high calcium content, small particle size, and large
   specific surface area, which make ASR has great potential for recycling
   as raw material in the field of building materials. However, due to the
   limitations of the ammonia-soda process, ASR contains a notable
   concentration of chloride ions. Integrating undechlorinated ASR into
   building material production may result in Cl dissolution, thereby
   compromising the durability of ASR-based building materials. At present,
   there is still a lack of effective and environmentally safe methods to
   remove Cl from ASR, which hinders the large-scale application of ASR.
   Overall, the utilization of ASR in building materials is still in its
   early stages, and further research is needed on durability and
   life-cycle assessments to enhance the safety and feasibility of ASR in
   construction applications. In addition, exploring the combination of ASR
   utilization with carbon sequestration methods and computer regression
   models presents a promising research direction that could accelerate the
   development and implementation of these materials, ultimately leading to
   more sustainable construction practices.},

   building integrated photovoltaic systems},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {195-206},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for performing sensitivity analysis on
   the capital and energy production costs of off-grid Building Integrated
   Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. The different influencing parameters that
   are considered in this study are the daily electric load on the system,
   available sunshine hours, per unit costs of components, maintenance and
   replacement costs, several design and rating factors, interest rates,
   and carbon credits. The probabilistic-based Latin hypercube sampling
   (LHS) technique and log-log regression were used to develop the
   correlations for the capital cost and energy production cost of the
   system. The results were validated by comparing them with case studies
   available in the published literature. Then, a standardized version of
   the dataset was used to derive the elasticity constants associated with
   each parameter, which quantified the change in costs when the parameter
   value was increased by a unit percentage. The effects on the costs of
   increasing the parameters by 10\% were quantified, ranked and compared.
   For the capital cost, the three most sensitive parameters were the daily
   electric load on system, the fudge factor and the available sunshine
   hours. In contrast, for the energy production cost, the three most
   sensitive parameters were the annual maintenance cost factor, the fudge
   factor and the interest rate. The correlation trends between these
   parameters and the costs were also plotted. Precautions and potential
   stakeholder actions for reducing the costs of off-grid BIPV systems are
   suggested.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Carbon emission analysis of precast concrete building Construction: A
   study on component transportation phase using Artificial Neural Network},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {301},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Off-site construction has been widely adopted for its carbon reduction
   potential. However, the emissions from its transportation stage are not
   fully explored. Given the rising prominence of Battery Electric Vehicles
   (BEVs), this study explores their potential carbon reduction benefits
   during the transportation of prefabricated components by comparing
   emissions from Fossil Vehicles (FVs) and BEVs. An
   Artificial-Neural-Network-based emission model is developed to estimate
   the carbon emissions of both vehicle types. Specifically, the model
   collects the real-time carbon emission dynamics across varying external
   conditions, encompassing diverse transportation constraints, vehicle
   operational statuses, and road conditions. By employing a supervised
   learning framework, the transportation carbon emission coefficient of
   prefabricated components is determined. Comparative analysis reveals
   that BEVs consistently outperforms FVs, achieving a peak reduction rate
   of 47.76\%. The negative correlation between the reduction rate of BEVs
   and factors like average speed and load rate underscores BEVs' advantage
   in urban transportation scenarios, where these factors tend to be low.
   Hence, the integration of BEVs in the transportation of prefabricated
   components is advocated. This study provides robust carbon emissions
   coefficients for BEVs in the transportation of prefabricated components,
   filling the gap in current estimation methods. These coefficients
   present a valuable tool for researchers, aiding in the accurate
   estimation of transportation carbon emissions and fostering the
   conceptualization of innovative carbon reduction tactics through BEV
   adoption.},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) lifecycle is a cyclic process to build an
   efficient ML system. Though a lot of commercial and community
   (non-commercial) frameworks have been proposed to streamline the major
   stages in the ML lifecycle, they are normally overqualified and
   insufficient for an ML system in its nascent phase. Driven by real-world
   experience in building and maintaining ML systems, we find that it is
   more efficient to initialize the major stages of ML lifecycle first for
   trial and error, followed by the extension of specific stages to
   acclimatize towards more complex scenarios. For this, we introduce a
   simple yet flexible framework, MLife, for fast ML lifecycle
   initialization. This is built on the fact that data flow in MLife is in
   a closed loop driven by bad cases, especially those which impact ML
   model performance the most but also provide the most value for further
   ML model development-a key factor towards enabling enterprises to fast
   track their ML capabilities. Better yet, MLife is also flexible enough
   to be easily extensible to more complex scenarios for future
   maintenance. For this, we introduce two real-world use cases to
   demonstrate that MLife is particularly suitable for ML systems in their
   early phases.},

Title = {Comparing inductive and deductive modeling of land use decisions:
   Principles, a model and an illustration from the philippines},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Understanding the causes of land use change is of great importance for
   issues of tropical deforestation, agricultural development and
   biodiversity conservation. Many quantitative studies, therefore, aim to
   link land use change to its causal `driving forces.' The epistemology of
   virtually all these studies is inductive, searching for correlations
   within relatively large, sometimes spatially explicit, datasets. This
   can be sound science but we here aim to exemplify that there is also
   scope for more deductive approaches that test a pre-defined explanatory
   theory. The paper first introduces the principles and merits of
   inductive and more deductive types of land use modeling. It then
   presents one integrated causal model that is subsequently specified to
   predict land use in an area in northeastern Philippines in a deductive
   manner, and tested against the observed land use in that area. The same
   set of land use data is also used in an inductive (multinomial
   regression) approach. With a goodness-of-prediction of 70\% of the
   deductive model and a goodness-of-fit of 77\% of the inductive model,
   both perform equally well, statistically. Because the deductive model
   explicitly contains not only the causal factors but also the causal
   mechanisms that explain land use, the deductive model then provides a
   more truly causal, as well as more theory-connected, understanding of
   land use. This provides land use scholarship with an invitation to add
   more deductive (theory-driven and theory-building) daring to its
   methodological repertoire.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning
   (DL) are technologies that have recently transformed many industries.
   The construction industry has traditionally been a laggard industry in
   terms of digital-technology adoption. When leading firms in this
   industry have experimented with these technologies, many of these
   experiments have met resistance. In this paper we take an institutional
   lens to study why and particular social structures appears to have
   contributed to the resistance and paucity of success stories. Within
   institutional research, we focus on research with traces to cognitive
   science and psychology. We have carried out a qualitative embedded
   multiple-case study on resistance to new technologies and how to
   overcome such resistance. The study involves four use cases in the
   Finnish construction industry: (1) automation of a material-product
   subcontractor's production planning; (2) business-model innovation by
   contractor on how to best work across multiple construction sites at
   once; (3) machine learning and automation of documentation by a software
   firm; and (4) promotion of a vision of information sharing across
   organizations by the above software firm. Based on within and cross-case
   analyses, preliminary empirical findings are that AI, ML and DL have in
   the Finnish construction industry challenged institutionalized forms of
   organizing and workflow established long since in the industry and,
   until about the time of this piece of research, taken for granted.
   Resistance was nonetheless beginning to be overcome at the time of
   writing this piece of research with small-group interaction across
   firms- such as those in this study- in the industry ecosystem.
   Human-human mediation and face-to-face encounters were building trust in
   and across the organizations. The implication for practice and policy is
   that business transformation will not quickly and autonomously transform
   into ``impersonal{''} or machine-machine exchange but, before that,
   requires human-human mediation. ``In the long-term, Al and analytics
   have boundless potential use cases in E\&C {[}i.e. engineering and
   construction]. Machine learning is gaining some momentum as an
   overarching use case (that is, one applicable to the entire construction
   life cycle, from preconstruction through O\&M 8i.e. operations and
   management), particularly in reality capture (for example, in
   conjunction with computer vision) as well as for comparison of in situ
   field conditions with plans (for example, supporting twin models).
   Indeed, by applying machine learning to an ongoing project, schedules
   could be optimized to sequence tasks and hit target deadlines, and
   divergences from blueprints could be caught closer to real time and
   corrected using a variety of predetermined potential scenarios.{''}

Abstract = {The construction industry including its support industries is one of the
   highest consumers of natural resources. In the act of consumption of
   natural resources during construction processes, embodied energy and
   greenhouse gases are emitted which have adverse effects on the natural
   environment. Thus, recent studies have revealed a significant interest
   in the quantification of embodied energy and greenhouse gases in
   construction processes. Unfortunately, current interpretations and
   quantification procedures of embodied energy and greenhouse gases are
   quite unclear. More also, while greenhouse gas and embodied energy
   quantification models are so disaggregated, studies reveal their
   existence in isolation without any links to other important
   environmental/construction management variables such as waste, time and
   cost. The objectives of this study are to identify the gaps in the
   current computation models, to reveal the relationships between the
   identified models and to propose a framework towards developing an
   integrated model for measuring embodied energy, greenhouse gases,
   construction waste, time and cost. The contributions of this study are
   three-fold. Firstly, the identification of the different models and
   variables, such that they can be used in computations, that can lead to
   consistent and comparable results. Secondly, investigate the
   relationships amongst embodied energy, greenhouse gases, construction
   waste, cost and time variables, that can facilitate the quantification
   process and hence potentially facilitate the engagement into low carbon
   building design by construction professionals. Lastly, lay the
   foundation for further research especially with regards to the
   integration of the different models and variables so that they can be
   measured simultaneously. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization, building energy consumption
   carbon emissions (BECCE) were increasing, weightily influencing global
   warming and the social-economic developments in cities. The detailed
   exploration of the most effective distance of urban three-dimensional
   (3D) compact form on BECCE guides urban space optimization. In this
   study, 135 People's Banks of China (PBC) were taken as samples. Based on
   the banks building features, socioeconomic conditions, macroclimate, and
   urban 3D compact form at different buffers, the most effective distance
   on the BECCE was determined. According to Partial least-squares
   regression (PLSR), the results show that the most effective distance of
   the urban compact form on the BECCE was 150 m. The study divided the
   normalized 3D compactness index (NVCI) values from 135 buildings for the
   distance of 150 m into five categories and used the geographic detector
   to recognize statistically obvious differences between the subregions.
   The natural breakpoint method was used to categorize the study area into
   five classes, specifically: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and
   high compact form. Based on the geographic detector method result, the
   compact form of medium, medium high, and high compact form was optimized
   to low, medium low. The optimization can effectively reduce the BECCE
   due to changing the compact form of the building by 65.2\% or 65.7\%.
   The study combined mathematical statistics with spatial analysis
   approaches to identify the most effective distance for reducing energy
   consumption. Our results will contribute toward considerable reductions
   in the BECCE.
   Innovatively used mathematical statistics to determine the most
   effective distance of urban compact forms.Demonstrated the influence of
   on BECCE to urban compact forms.Determined the most effective distance
   was 150 m.Verified the most effective distance was 150 m in different
   building climate zones.Optimized the urban 3D compact form within 150 m
   to reduce the BECCE.},

Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},

Volume = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy demand profiling of varied stocks within the Faculty of
   Engineering is investigated, comprising of audit activities like the
   performance optimization of air-conditioners and other energy
   appliances. Using a newly-developed renewable energy (RE) calculator,
   standard energy performance methodologies, including cooling load
   analysis, energy audit and rating exercises, thermal comfort analysis,
   distributed power generation from wind turbine and solar photovoltaic
   module, are adopted. Based on a comprehensive energy audit exercise,
   areas of energy saving potential are observed. Also, the minimum energy
   performance standard of energy appliances for maximum human thermal
   comfort is assessed. Towards the possibility of integrating different
   sources of renewable energy into the Faculty of Engineering for
   alternative power supply, an open source widget toolkit based on Qt
   development environment is used to design a new renewable energy (RE)
   calculator, known as EnerghxPlus. A multiple objective function approach
   is proposed to properly evaluate all the key performance indicators
   simultaneously, thereby unveiling the existing gaps and identifying
   possible synergies and strategies in the estimation of the building life
   cycle. The regression of the data obtained from the segregated
   optimization approach shows a strong linear relationship (i.e., for the
   appliance audit, the coefficient of determination is approximately 84\%;
   while the correlation coefficient is 0.92). It is anticipated that the
   application of the proposed methodologies to the multi-scale and
   multi-objective nature of the challenges in the optimization of energy
   demand in the built environment will address the uncertainties in
   previous modelling strategies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Few-shot learning for structural health diagnosis of civil
   infrastructure},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Number = {A},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The successful development of deep learning and computer vision
   techniques has recently revolutionized structural health diagnosis (SHD)
   during life-cycle construction, inspection, maintenance, and disaster
   prevention for civil infrastructure. Multi-source big data of structural
   health monitoring (SHM) and inspection are projected into a high-level
   feature space, and data-driven models are established to map the
   relationships between inputs and outputs and dig out embedded structural
   behaviors and implicit physical mechanisms. However, the model
   performance highly relies on the extensive amount and diversity,
   intra-class completeness, and inter-class balance of training data, and
   the generalization ability on scarce data with specific features and
   particular patterns is challenging under real-world scenarios. To
   address the above challenges, few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a
   cutting-edge machine learning technique that designs training strategies
   using only a small amount of annotated data under a limited supervision
   regime to enhance effectiveness and generalization ability. This article
   systematically summarizes recent advances in FSL algorithms and the
   corresponding applications in SHD for civil infrastructure. A unified
   mathematical framework of FSL is formulated, and an FSL taxonomy is
   summarized according to intrinsic learning mechanisms and implementation
   principles, including metric learning-based, optimization-based,
   transfer learning-based, and generative model-based methods. Various
   applications of SHD for civil infrastructure under real-world scenarios
   are reviewed, including remote sensing monitoring, structural damage
   recognition, post-disaster safety evaluation, and construction risk
   assessment. Error analyses of approximation, generalization, and
   optimization errors corresponding to the four paradigms mentioned above
   are formulated for FSL-based data-driven modeling, which exactly acts as
   the logical connection with how new thoughts of FSL-based SHD should be
   designed. Finally, potential prospects of FSLbased SHD are outlined to
   design weakly supervised FSL considering low-quality data from SHM
   systems, develop multi-modal FSL for multi-source SHM data, establish
   cross-task FSL with high commonality and generality for various SHD
   tasks, and construct lightweight FSL framework with model compression
   for real-world applications of SHD considering the super-large stream of
   monitoring data.},

Journal = {STRUCTURAL SAFETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {A machine learning framework is presented to assess post-earthquake
   structural safety. The concepts of response and damage patterns are
   introduced and incorporated into a systematic methodology for generating
   a robust dataset for any damaged building. incremental dynamic analysis
   using sequential ground motions is used to evaluate the residual
   collapse capacity of the damaged structure. Machine learning algorithms
   are used to map response and damage patterns to the structural safety
   state (safe or unsafe to occupy) of the building based on an acceptable
   threshold of residual collapse capacity. Predictive models including
   classification and regression tree and Random Forests are used to
   probabilistically identify the structural safety state of an
   earthquake-damaged building. The proposed framework is applied to a
   4-story reinforced concrete special moment frame building. Distinct yet
   partially overlapping response and damage patterns are found for the
   damaged building classified as safe and unsafe. High prediction
   accuracies of 91\% and 88\% are achieved when the safety state is
   assessed using response and damage patterns respectively. The proposed
   framework could be used to rapidly evaluate whether a damaged building
   remains structurally safe to occupy after a seismic event and can be
   implemented as a subroutine in community resilience evaluation or
   building lifecycle performance assessment and optimization. (C) 2017

Title = {Using Knowledge Graphs to Unlock Practical Collection, Integration, and
   Audit of AI Accountability Information},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {74383-74411},
Abstract = {To enhance trustworthiness of AI systems, a number of solutions have
   been proposed to document how such systems are built and used. A key
   facet of realizing trust in AI is how to make such systems accountable -
   a challenging task, not least due to the lack of an agreed definition of
   accountability and differing perspectives on what information should be
   recorded and how it should be used (e.g., to inform audit). Information
   originates across the life cycle stages of an AI system and from a
   variety of sources (individuals, organizations, systems), raising
   numerous challenges around collection, management, and audit. In our
   previous work, we argued that semantic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are
   ideally suited to address those challenges and we presented an approach
   utilizing KGs to aid in the tasks of modelling, recording, viewing, and
   auditing accountability information related to the design stage of AI
   system development. Moreover, as KGs store data in a structured format
   understandable by both humans and machines, we argued that this approach
   provides new opportunities for building intelligent applications that
   facilitate and automate such tasks. In this paper, we expand our earlier
   work by reporting additional detailed requirements for knowledge
   representation and capture in the context of AI accountability; these
   extend the scope of our work beyond the design stage, to also include
   system implementation. Furthermore, we present the RAInS ontology which
   has been extended to satisfy these requirements. We evaluate our
   approach against three popular baseline frameworks, namely, Datasheets,
   Model Cards, and FactSheets, by comparing the range of information that
   can be captured by our KGs against these three frameworks. We
   demonstrate that our approach subsumes and extends the capabilities of
   the baseline frameworks and discuss how KGs can be used to integrate and
   enhance accountability information collection processes.},

Abstract = {The implementation of railway intelligent construction is the need of
   national strategic development and the demand of society. Based on the
   idea of system engineering, this paper proposes a three-dimensional
   railway intelligent construction system architecture composed of a full
   life cycle, management level and technical support. Based on this
   architecture, a ``three-step{''} implementation path is proposed. Then,
   it analyzes the technology support framework required in the
   architecture based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), incorporating
   Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS),
   algorithmic prediction and machine learning technology, Internet of
   Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technology, big data and cloud
   computing technology, and the application of railway intelligent
   construction system architecture is analyzed by taking a railway tunnel
   project in Zhejiang Province of China as an example. Finally, it
   discusses the problems that may be encountered in the implementation of
   railway intelligent construction and puts forward relevant suggestions.
   The results show that railway intelligent construction is an essential
   way. At present, China's railway intelligent construction is still in
   the primary stage. The design organization should do a good job in the
   top-level design and accumulate sufficient data for the later stage. All
   parties in the middle stage of construction should do a good job in the
   induction and integration of information and accumulate sufficient
   experience. In this way, we can integrate into the advanced stage and
   give full play to the advantages of software and hardware integrated
   applications such as BIM, IoT, big data, cloud computing and intelligent
   devices so as to truly realize the intellectualization and modernization
   of railway construction.},

Abstract = {Machine learning has become an essential tool for gleaning knowledge
   from data and tackling a diverse set of computationally hard tasks.
   However, the accuracy of a machine learned model is deeply tied to the
   data that it is trained on. Designing and building robust processes and
   tools that make it easier to analyze, validate, and transform data that
   is fed into large-scale machine learning systems poses data management
   challenges.
   Drawn from our experience in developing data-centric infrastructure for
   a production machine learning platform at Google, we summarize some of
   the interesting research challenges that we encountered, and survey some
   of the relevant literature from the data management and machine learning
   communities. Specifically, we explore challenges in three main areas of
   focus data understanding, data validation and cleaning, and data
   preparation. In each of these areas, we try to explore how different
   constraints are imposed on the solutions depending on where in the
   lifecycle of a model the problems are encountered and who encounters
   them.},

Abstract = {The residential sector accounts for approximately 27 and 17\% of the
   world energy consumption and its CO2 emission, respectively. Thus,
   developing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in this sector,
   which is highly associated with the rapidly increasing proportion of
   world's urban population, is crucial to ensuring the sustainable
   development of the urban environment. However, the majority of the
   existing expertise on energy sustainability revolves around improving
   the thermal quality of the building envelop with lesser focus on the
   social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. Given the
   importance of factors pertaining to the latter aspects, which are found
   to be responsible for 4-30\% of the variation in residential energy
   consumption, this paper aims to address and explore for the first time
   the impact of the UK residents' life-cycle evolution on their energy
   usage. To attain this, an official database encompassing around 5000
   households observed over the course of 10 years was analysed with the
   help of specific statistical tests and procedures (e.g. logistic
   regression). First, logistic regression was employed to determine the
   socio-economic factors influencing households' evolution from one state
   to another; consequently, future evolutionary models covering a 10-year
   window, were predicted. This was followed by analysing the effect of the
   predicted evolutionary models on the households' gas and electricity
   usage patterns using point-biserial correlation. Finally, the findings
   suggest that households' evolution have a significant effect on their
   energy consumption patterns. However, the magnitude and the direction of
   this effect is weak and mostly positive, respectively.},

Title = {Construction and Research of a Data-Driven Energy Consumption Evaluation
   Model for Urban Building Operation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {139439-139456},
Abstract = {The bottom-up simulation method of building energy consumption, which
   mainly focuses on individual buildings, is difficult to apply to urban
   and regional level building energy consumption planning. Therefore,
   based on data-driven research, a simulation evaluation model for extreme
   gradient boosting at the mesoscale and K-means energy consumption at the
   macro scale is proposed and validated. The experimental results show
   that in the mesoscale model simulation prediction, in terms of training
   time comparison, the support vector method and sequential model have a
   time of 138.69 seconds and 90.00 seconds, respectively, which is much
   higher than other algorithms. The random forest algorithm has the
   highest accuracy comparison, at 83\%; In the comparison of accuracy
   recall rate, the gradient improvement decision tree algorithm has the
   highest accuracy, at 83\%. The extreme gradient boosting model proposed
   based on it has a mean square error value of 11.45 in residential sample
   prediction under refrigeration load and 9.16 under heating load, both of
   which are better than the comparative model. Applying it to practice, it
   is found that the correlation between building heating and cooling load
   and the 8 variables of the building is clearly demonstrated. In the
   macro scale model simulation prediction, the overall effect of K-means
   model I is the best under the comparison of contour coefficients, with
   the highest value maintained at around 0.1 when the number of clusters
   is 10. By applying it in practice, the spatial distribution of load can
   be clearly demonstrated, and the predicted value of total energy supply
   in the constructed regression equation is highly consistent with the
   actual value. Overall, the simulation and evaluation model for urban
   building energy consumption proposed in the study at two scales is
   practical and can effectively accelerate the development and improvement
   of urban energy systems. In addition, the research method considers the
   relevant operational energy consumption throughout the entire life cycle
   and the dynamic energy consumption of urban transportation systems, and
   provides reference value for existing urban renovation, thus possessing
   innovation.},

Title = {Impact of household transitions on domestic energy consumption and its
   applicability to urban energy planning},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-183},

Abstract = {The household sector consumes roughly 30\% of Earth's energy resources
   and emits approximately 17\% of its carbon dioxide. As such, developing
   appropriate policies to reduce the CO2 emissions, which are associated
   with the world's rapidly growing urban population, is a high priority.
   This, in turn, will enable the creation of cities that respect the
   natural environment and the well-being of future generations. However,
   most of the existing expertise focuses on enhancing the thermal quality
   of buildings through building physics while few studies address the
   social and behavioral aspects. In fact, focusing on these aspects should
   be more prominent, as they cause between 4\% and 30\% of variation in
   domestic energy consumption. Premised on that, the aim of this study was
   to investigate the effect in the context of the UK of household
   transitions on household energy consumption patterns. To achieve this,
   we applied statistical procedures (e.g., logistic regression) to
   official panel survey data comprising more than 5500 households in the
   UK tracked annually over the course of 18 years. This helped in
   predicting future transition patterns for different household types for
   the next 10 to 15 years. Furthermore, it enabled us to study the
   relationship between the predicted patterns and the household energy
   usage for both gas and electricity. The findings indicate that the life
   cycle transitions of a household significantly influence its domestic
   energy usage. However, this effect is mostly positive in direction and
   weak in magnitude. Finally, we present our developed urban energy model
   ``EvoEnergy{''} to demonstrate the importance of incorporating such a
   concept in energy forecasting for effective sustainable energy
   decision-making.},

Title = {Modelling global material stocks and flows for residential and service
   sector buildings towards 2050},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {245},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Residential buildings and service sector buildings have an important
   contribution to climate change, directly via energy use in these
   buildings and indirectly through construction activities and the
   production and disposal of buildings materials. In this paper, we
   introduce a model that looks at total global building stock for 26
   regions between 1970 and 2050 and calculates the floor space and
   building materials both in new buildings and in demolished buildings.
   For residential buildings, we build upon the work of Marinova et al.
   (2019, this issue), who used a building material database to come up
   with scenarios for materials in the residential building stock. This
   paper adds two things. First, we introduce a new regression-based model
   for service building floor space, recognizing 4 different types of
   service-related buildings. Secondly, we use a dynamic stock model, based
   on lifetime distributions found in literature, to calculate the
   construction (inflow) and demolition (outflow) of building floor space
   for both residential and service-related purposes. We combine this with
   data from the building material database to come up with scenarios for
   the annual demand for construction materials worldwide as well as an
   estimation of the availability of waste materials after building
   demolition towards 2050. The model can thus be used to assess the
   potential for closing the material cycles in the construction sector,
   while distinguishing urban and rural areas explicitly. The results show
   that demand for construction materials will continue to increase in most
   regions, even in developed countries. Global demand for steel and cement
   for the building sector is estimated to be 769 Mt/yr and 11.9 Gt/yr
   respectively, by the end of the modelling period. This represents a
   respective growth of 31\% and 14\% compared to today. Drivers behind
   this are an expected growth of global residential building stock of
   about 50\%, and a growth of about 150\% in the building stock for
   services. Our model projects that by 2050, only 55\% of
   construction-related demand for copper, wood and steel could potentially
   be covered by recycled building materials. For other materials the
   availability of scrap may be higher, reaching up to 71\% of new demand
   in the case of aluminium. This means that in most regions urban mining
   cannot cover the growing demand for construction materials. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus integrase (HIV-1IN) is an emerging and

Title = {How urbanization and ecological conditions affect urban diet-linked GHG
   emissions: New evidence from China},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {176},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Unprecedented urbanization is dramatically altering habitual food
   consumption in urban China, and consequently affecting diet-linked
   greenhouse gas emissions (DGHGEs). Building on the representative
   resident survey data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this
   study analyzed urban food consumption profiles and related GHG emissions
   from a life cycle perspective. Moreover, a CATREG (Categorical
   Regression) model was conducted to identify influencing factors. Results
   show that urban residents in China generate an average of 2.92 kg
   CO(2)e/capita/day, with 1.06 kg of foods consumed. Meat consumption has
   a dominant role in urban DGHGEs and is the main driver of variation in
   the DGHGEs. Urbanization level and most demographic factors with regard
   to household and individual characteristics have significant impacts on
   urban DGHGEs. However, the resident's awareness of the Chinese Dietary
   Guideline dose not significantly contribute to promoting low-GHG urban
   diets. A novel result of this analysis is that local ecological
   conditions, including geographical climate and resource endowments, have
   evident effects on urban food consumption and the related GHG emissions,
   despite the fact that urban areas heavily rely on food resources
   imported from other regions. Our findings offer knowledge-based
   inspiration geared to sustainable urban food consumption for both China
   and other developing countries.},

Title = {Integrating BIM into sensor-based facilities management operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {385-400},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To mitigate the problems in sensor-based facility management (FM) such
   as lack of detailed visual information about a built facility and the
   maintenance of large scale sensor deployments, an integrated data source
   for the facility's life cycle should be used. Building information
   modeling (BIM) provides a useful visual model and database that can be
   used as a repository for all data captured or made during the facility's
   life cycle. It can be used for modeling the sensing-based system for
   data collection, serving as a source of all information for smart
   objects such as the sensors used for that purpose. Although few studies
   have been conducted in integrating BIM with sensor-based monitoring
   system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between FMs and Internet of Things (IoT) companies in
   cases encountered failed sensors has received the least attention in the
   technical literature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   conceptualize and develop a BIM-based system architecture for fault
   detection and alert generation for malfunctioning FM sensors in smart
   IoT environments during the operational phase of a building to ensure
   minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper describes an attempt to examine the applicability of BIM for
   an efficient sensor failure management system in smart IoT environments
   during the operational phase of a building. For this purpose, a
   seven-story office building with four typical types of FM-related
   sensors with all associated parameters was modeled in a commercial BIM
   platform. An integrated workflow was developed in Dynamo, a visual
   programming tool, to integrate the associated sensors
   maintenance-related information to a cloud-based tool to provide a fast
   and efficient communication platform between the building facility
   manager and IoT companies for intelligent sensor management.
   Findings
   The information within BIM allows better and more effective
   decision-making for building facility managers. Integrating building and
   sensors information within BIM to a cloud-based system can facilitate
   better communication between the building facility manager and IoT
   company for an effective IoT system maintenance. Using a developed
   integrated workflow (including three specifically designed modules) in
   Dynamo, a visual programming tool, the system was able to automatically
   extract and send all essential information such as the type of failed
   sensors as well as their model and location to IoT companies in the
   event of sensor failure using a cloud database that is effective for the
   timely maintenance and replacement of sensors. The system developed in
   this study was implemented, and its capabilities were illustrated
   through a case study. The use of the developed system can help facility
   managers in taking timely actions in the event of any sensor failure
   and/or malfunction to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Research limitations/implications
   However, there are some limitations in this work which are as follows:
   while the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using BIM in the
   maintenance planning of monitoring systems in the building, the
   developed workflow can be expanded by integrating some type of sensors
   like an occupancy sensor to the developed workflow to automatically
   record and identify the number of occupants (visitors) to prioritize the
   maintenance work; and the developed workflow can be integrated with the
   sensors' data and some machine learning techniques to automatically
   identify the sensors' malfunction and update the BIM model accordingly.
   Practical implications
   Transferring the related information such as the room location,
   occupancy status, number of occupants, type and model of the sensor,
   sensor ID and required action from the BIM model to the cloud would be
   extremely helpful to the IoT companies to actually visualize workspaces
   in advance, and to plan for timely and effective decision-making without
   any physical inspection, and to support maintenance planning decisions,
   such as prioritizing maintenance works by considering different factors
   such as the importance of spaces and number of occupancies. The
   developed framework is also beneficial for preventive maintenance works.
   The system can be set up according to the maintenance and time-based
   expiration schedules, automatically sharing alerts with FMs and IoT
   maintenance contractors in advance about the IoT parts replacement. For
   effective predictive maintenance planning, machine learning techniques
   can be integrated into the developed workflow to efficiently predict the
   future condition of individual IoT components such as data loggers and
   sensors, etc. as well as MEP components.
   Originality/value
   Lack of detailed visual information about a built facility can be a
   reason behind the inefficient management of a facility. Detecting and
   repairing failed sensors at the earliest possible time is critical to
   ensure the functional continuity of the monitoring systems. On the other
   hand, the maintenance of large-scale sensor deployments becomes a
   significant challenge. Despite its importance, few studies have been
   conducted in integrating BIM with a sensor-based monitoring system,
   providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between facility managers and IoT companies in cases
   encountered failed sensors. In this paper, a cloud-based BIM platform
   was developed for the maintenance and timely replacement of sensors
   which are critical to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services
   in sensor-based FM.},

Title = {3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration for preservation of built
   heritage in China: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, the technical application of 3D LiDAR has gradually
   expanded to the field of built heritage. 3D scanning, high-precision
   measurement, and reconstruction have enriched the methods of built
   heritage preservation and significantly improved the quality of heritage
   preservation in China. 3D LiDAR has broken through the limitations of a
   single technology application and played a greater role in the field of
   heritage preservation on different scales. Through the collaboration of
   multi-technology, such as 3D printing, digital mapping, internet of
   things, machine learning, intelligent sensors, close-range
   photogrammetry, infrared detection, stress wave tomography, material
   analysis, XR technology, reverse engineering, etc., 3D LiDAR shows its
   technological advantages on exploring the remote real-time monitoring
   and digitization of the built heritage, geological and environmental
   data collection, prediction of sedimentation, deformation monitoring,
   weather monitoring,system life cycle health detection, digital
   reproduction of built heritage for developing scientific problems and
   engineering practices such as building contour recognition, information
   feature matching, structural reinforcement and damaged component
   replacement. In addition, through the docking with GIS, HBIM, XR, and
   CIM, it provides fine digital models and high-precision data benchmarks
   which contribute to the heritage visual reproduction; and through the
   docking with 3Ds Max, SketchUp, and other modeling software, it has
   contributed to the renewal design of the built heritage, space
   optimization, and the scientificity and rationality of the heritage
   value evaluation. However, past technology applications also highlighted
   many problems such as limited recorded information, a large amount of
   data, high difficulty in collaboration, non-standardized and fragmented
   data, and difficulty in data mining and comprehensive utilization. There
   are still deficiencies in building a built heritage data backplane, and
   the development of a dynamic, three-dimensional, intelligent and refined
   heritage monitoring system, and further research is needed on these
   issues. This study reviews the previous academic progress and
   application of 3D LiDAR in the reconstruction of built heritage and
   multi-technology collaboration in the process of preservation, clarifies
   the current research hotspots and methods, the frontier issues of
   concern, and also clarifies the specific problems and challenges in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Carbon emission quantifications in China are not consistent, with many
   standards and methods having been used over the years. This study
   identified the non-consideration of China-specific technology and
   databases as a factor limiting comprehensive quantification. The study
   aimed to comprehensively quantify regional direct CO2 emission in the
   industry using a hybrid of economic and environmental data. We retrieved
   nineteen (19) sets of fossil fuel and electricity data from provincial
   energy yearbooks between 1997 and 2015 for the study. To generate
   regression models for each of the six regional construction industries
   in China, the study further integrated the results with three sets of
   econometric data: total annual construction output, cement, and steel
   product yearly consumption data. The study identified the North China
   region as the main source of direct CO2 emission with over 30\%, while
   Southeast China contributed the least. While there is a gradual shift to
   other energy sources, the study identified coal and crude oil to remain
   as the main energy sources in the industry. Cement and steel data
   exhibited a significant predictive relationship with CO2 emissions in
   five regional construction industries. The study identified the need to
   have policies tailored to technological improvements to enhance
   renewable energy generation and usage in the industry. The models
   developed in this study could be used to generate initial
   quantifications of carbon emissions in construction industries with
   similar carbon-emitting characteristics for carbon tracking, and energy
   policies for decision making. However, the three economic indicators
   used in the study could be extended to generate more robust models in
   future research.},

Title = {Early predicting cooling loads for energy-efficient design in office
   buildings by machine learning},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {264-273},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Energy-efficient building design has become imperative for energy
   conservation, emissions reduction, and life quality enhancement of
   occupant. Physics-based whole building energy simulation is widely used
   to access building energy performance, which requires large amount of
   information to specify values of input parameters and includes
   underlying assumptions. This study proposed an alternative model based
   on machine learning (ML) to predict cooling loads of buildings with few
   common parameters in the design phase. The ML models were developed and
   evaluated using a dataset of 243 buildings. Predicted cooling loads from
   these models were compared to those from the physics-based whole
   building energy simulation. The proposed model exhibits good agreement
   with the physics-based whole building energy simulation. The analytical
   results present that the ML models obtained the correlation coefficient
   (R) of 0.98-0.99, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of
   6.17-12.93\% which shows the high agreement between observed and
   predicted values of cooling loads in building. Notably, the ensemble
   bagging artificial neural networks yielded the highest R of 0.99, the
   lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 158.77 kW, the lowest MAE of
   112.07 kW, and the lowest MAPE of 6.17\% among all models in this study.
   This research contributes to (i) the state of the knowledge by examining
   various ML models that can predict cooling loads in the early building
   design stage; and (ii) the state of practice by providing an alternative
   tool in the design process through better understanding of relationships
   between building cooling loads and building characteristics for
   enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {An Empirical Investigation on Wrapper-Based Feature Selection for

Abstract = {The basic measurements for software quality control and management are
   the various project and software metrics collected at various states of
   a software development life cycle. The software metrics may not all be
   relevant for predicting the fault proneness of software components,
   modules, or releases. Thus creating the need for the use of feature
   (software metric) selection. The goal of feature selection is to find a
   minimum subset of attributes that can characterize the underlying data
   with results as well as, or even better than the original data when all
   available features are considered. As an example of inter-disciplinary
   research (between data science and software engineering), this study is
   unique in presenting a large comparative study of wrapper-based feature
   (or attribute) selection techniques for building defect predictors. In
   this paper, we investigated thirty wrapper-based feature selection
   methods to remove irrelevant and redundant software metrics used for
   building defect predictors. In this study, these thirty wrappers vary
   based on the choice of search method (Best First or Greedy Stepwise),
   leaner (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression),
   and performance metric (Overall Accuracy, Area Under ROC (Receiver
   Operating Characteristic) Curve, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve,
   Best Geometric Mean, and Best Arithmetic Mean) used in the defect
   prediction model evaluation process. The models are trained using the
   three learners and evaluated using the five performance metrics. The
   case study is based on software metrics and defect data collected from a
   real world software project.
   The results demonstrate that Best Arithmetic Mean is the best
   performance metric used within the wrapper. Naive Bayes performed
   significantly better than Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine
   as a wrapper learner on slightly and less imbalanced datasets. We also
   recommend Greedy Stepwise as a search method for wrappers. Moreover,
   comparing to models built with full datasets, the performances of defect
   prediction models can be improved when metric subsets are selected
   through a wrapper subset selector.},

Abstract = {Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) aim to establish a set of practices
   that put tools, pipelines, and processes to build fast time-to-value
   machine learning development projects. The lifecycle of machine learning
   project development encompasses a set of roles, stacks of software
   frameworks and multiple types of computing resources. Such complexity
   makes MLOps support usually bundled with commercial cloud platforms that
   is referred as vendor lock. In this paper, we provide an alternative
   solution that devises a MLOps platform with open source frameworks on
   any virtual resources. Our MLOps approach is driven by the development
   roles of machine learning models. The tool chain of our MLOps connects
   to the typical CI/CD workflow of machine learning applications. We
   demonstrate a working example of training and deploying a model for the
   application of detecting software repository code vulnerability.

Title = {Net-zero buildings: when carbon and energy metrics diverge},
Journal = {BUILDINGS \& CITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-99},
Abstract = {Many climate change -related building frameworks are designed to improve
   environmental performance by requiring reduced net energy demand, as it
   is widely assumed that energy demand (e.g. delivered/final, primary,
   primary non-renewable) is a good proxy for carbon emissions. However,
   energy grids are becoming less carbon intensive, meaning that the
   climate change mitigation value of renewably generated energy is not
   static, and is likely to decrease. In this research, a global integrated
   building carbon and energy model was created to explore how assessed
   building performance responded to stepwise variation in multiple
   building features. Operational and embodied metrics were measured
   concurrently on the basis of carbon emissions and delivered final energy
   demand, and included renewable energy generation (via roof -mounted
   photovoltaics), resulting in two 12.3 million -point data sets. Logistic
   regression was used to identify patterns in the data sets using binary
   building classifications (zero or non -zero energy or carbon). The
   results demonstrate that the profiles of the energy and carbon metric
   data sets do not mirror each other, indicating that a delivered energy
   demand assessment is not necessarily a good proxy for carbon emissions.
   The divergence of these metrics is likely to grow in future as energy
   grids are increasingly decarbonised. Policy relevance The energy metric
   is often relied upon as an indicator of climate -related building
   performance. However, policy -makers and designers should instead focus
   their attention on a carbon metric in order to achieve the drastic
   reduction in carbon emissions needed for the 1.5 degrees C limit on
   rising global temperatures. Grid generated energy (particularly
   electricity) tends to be viewed as universally carbon intensive, so
   offsetting even a small amount with renewable energy is seen as
   beneficial. This research demonstrates that design philosophies
   underpinning zero -energy building (ZEB) assessment outcomes are likely
   to be driven by environmental factors (i.e. overcoming temperature and
   insolation challenges). However, the zero -carbon equivalent is likely
   to be more closely associated with the characteristics of the
   electricity grid servicing the building. This study highlights the fact
   that, to accrue real benefits, long-term policy and design decisions
   need to factor in the changing nature of the carbon implications of
   energy demand and generation.},

Abstract = {In many areas, such as image recognition, natural language processing,
   search, recommendation, autonomous cars, systems software and
   infrastructure, and even Software Engineering tools themselves, Software
   2.0 (= programming using learned models) is quickly swallowing Software
   1.0 (= programming using handcrafted algorithms). Where the Software 1.0
   Engineer formally specifies their problem, carefully designs algorithms,
   composes systems out of subsystems or decomposes complex systems into
   smaller components, the Software 2.0 Engineer amasses training data and
   simply feeds it into an ML algorithm that will synthesize an
   approximation of the function whose partial extensional definition is
   that training data. Instead of code as the artifact of interest, in
   Software 2.0 it is all about the data where compilation of source code
   is replaced by training models with data. This new style of programming
   has far-reaching consequences for traditional software engineering
   practices. Everything we have learned about life cycle models, project
   planning and estimation, requirements analysis, program design,
   construction, debugging, testing, maintenance and implementation, ...
   runs the danger of becoming obsolete.
   One way to try to prepare for the new realities of software engineering
   is not to zero in on the differences between Software 1.0 and Software
   2.0 but instead focus on their similarities. If you carefully look at
   what a neural net actually represents, you realize that in essence it is
   a pure function, from multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers
   to multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers (tensors). What is
   special about these functions is that they are differentiable (yes,
   exactly as you remember from middle school calculus), which allows them
   to be trained using back propagation. The programming language community
   has also discovered that there is a deep connection between back
   propagation and continuations. Moreover, when you look closely at how
   Software 2.0 Engineers construct complex neural nets like CNNs, RNNs,
   LSTMs, ... you recognize they are (implicitly) using high-order
   combinatory like map, fold, zip, scan, recursion, conditionals, function
   composition, ... to compose complex neural network architectures out of
   simple building blocks. Constructing neural networks using pure and
   higher-order differentiable functions and training them using
   reverse-mode automatic differentiation is unsurprisingly called
   Differentiable Programming. This talk will illustrate the deep
   programming language principles behind Differentiable Programming, which
   will hopefully inspire the working Software 1.0 engineer to pay serious
   attention to the threats and opportunities of Software 2.0.},

Abstract = {Geopolitical instability is exacerbating the risk of catastrophic
   cyber-attacks striking where defences are weak. Nevertheless,
   cyber-attack trend forecasting predominantly relies on human expertise,
   which is susceptible to subjectivity and potential bias. Asa solution,
   we have recently presented a novel study that harnesses machine learning
   for long-term cyber-attack forecasting. Building upon this groundwork,
   our research advances to the next level, by predicting the disparity
   between cyber-attack trends and the trend of the relevant alleviation
   technologies. The proposed approach applies key constructs of Protection
   Motivation Theory while introducing a proactive version of the theory.
   Our predictive analysis aims to offer strategic insights for the
   decision of investment in cyber security technologies. It also provides
   a sound foundation for the strategic decisions of national defence
   agencies. To achieve this objective, we have expanded our dataset, which
   now encompasses records spanning 42 distinct cyber-attack types and
   various related features, alongside data concerning the trends of 98
   pertinent technologies, dating back to 2011. The dataset features were
   meticulously curated from diverse sources, including news articles,
   blogs, government advisories, as well as from platforms such as
   Elsevier, Twitter, and Python APIs. With our comprehensive dataset in
   place, we construct a graph that elucidates the intricate interplay
   between cyber threats and the development of pertinent alleviation
   technologies. To forecast the graph, we introduce a novel Bayesian
   adaptation of a recently proposed graph neural network model, which
   effectively captures and predicts these trends. We further demonstrate
   the efficacy of our proposed features in this context. Furthermore, our
   study extends its horizon by generating future data projections for the
   next three years, encompassing forecasts for the evolving graph,
   including predictions of the gap between cyber-attack trends and the
   trend of the associated technologies. Asa consequential outcome of our
   forecasting efforts, we introduce the concept of ``alleviation
   technologies cycle{''}, delineating the key phases in the life cycle of
   98 technologies. These findings serve as a foundational resource,
   offering valuable guidance for future investment and strategic defence
   decisions within the realm of cyber security related technologies.},

Abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in buildings can
   assist in reducing energy consumption through enhanced control,
   automation, and reliability. This review aims to explore the use of AI
   to enhance energy efficiency throughout various stages of the building
   lifecycle, including building design, construction, operation and
   control, maintenance, and retrofit. The review encompasses multiple
   studies in the field published between 2018 and 2023. These studies were
   identified through keyword searches that best represent the topic, using
   various research databases. In addition to summarizing the technologies
   and approaches related to AI and energy efficiency, this review
   discusses future opportunities for the application of AI in energy
   efficiency within these lifecycle stages. The review highlights that
   AI-based solutions are currently employed in building design generation
   and optimization, decision-making, predictive and adaptive control,
   fault detection and diagnosis, as well as energy benchmarking. These
   applications effectively facilitate energy efficiency in buildings to
   meet today's energy needs. However, further research is needed to
   explore the use of AI in the construction phase to support the

Title = {Does urbanization lead to less energy use on road transport? Evidence
   from municipalities in Norway},

Abstract = {The relationship between urbanization, energy use, and CO2 emissions has
   been extensively studied in recent years, however little attention paid
   to the differences in urban forms. Previous studies implicitly assume
   that the urban form is homogenous across different urban areas. Such an
   assumption is questionable as urban form can have many different facets.
   This paper investigates the effects of urbanization on the road
   transport energy use by considering different urban forms from a dataset
   of 386 Norwegian municipalities from 2006 to 2009. Using the Stochastic
   Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT)
   model with an energy use identity equation, the main findings (1)
   confirm the well-established result that urban density has a negative
   and significant influence on road transport energy use, and (2)
   demonstrate that the effect of urbanization partly depends on the level
   of urban density. These results imply that additional increases in
   urbanization in dense areas yield greater decreases in road transport
   energy use per capita. Additional findings posit that (3) there is a
   non-linear (quadratic) relationship between road energy use per capita
   and urban population. This implies that an increase in total
   municipality population over a specific turning point can result in a
   decrease in road energy use per capita. However, (4) the ratio of urban
   residential buildings with private gardens has a negative and
   significant influence on road transport energy use. This implies that
   there may be a trade-off between compact and sprawl city development
   strategies, highlighting that sustainable energy use requires further
   investigation.},

Title = {The presence of emotional factors: An empirical exploration of bundle
   purchasing process},

Abstract = {While the telecommunications industry is in the process of introducing
   bundles that cover pricing, services, and content, several risks remain
   to be clarified and avoided. In this paper, we reviewed the literature,
   on the motives behind the consumer's decision to purchase a bundle and
   found that holistic frameworks of purchasing factors, especially in
   bundle purchasing, are rare. To reach a more comprehensive framework, we
   examined the bundle purchasing process through an empirical study that
   incorporates old and new elements in the purchasing of bundled services.
   Starting with the customer's concerns in the purchasing process, we
   widened the scope to include considerations of usage convenience and
   life-cycle costs related to bundles, and we covered various other
   potential open question specific to bundling. By means of exploratory
   factor analysis, following the K-1 rule, we extracted eight factors and
   gave them preliminary names. Moreover, we conducted a linear regression
   analysis on how these eight factors influence the customer's willingness
   to buy a bundle service. Therefore, these factors can serve as a
   framework for further studies on the bundle purchasing process.
   In this paper, we also discussed newly discovered emotional factors
   affecting the purchasing process. In particular, usage convenience and
   self-image seem to be self-standing factors affecting the willingness to
   buy. This paper also contains an acknowledgment of the study's
   limitations to ascertain the reliability and validity of the study and
   of the factors extracted. Finally, we discussed the results and their
   contribution to theory building in bundle-specific marketing research
   and to practicing telecommunications managers, and we offered
   suggestions for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Application of Computer Vision in Machine Learning- Based Diagnosis of
   Water Production Mechanisms in Oil Wells},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2365-2384},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Diagnostic plots, introduced by K. S. Chan, are widely used to determine
   excessive water production mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce a
   computer vision model that is capable of segmenting and identifying
   multiple Chan signatures per plot, for the sake of surveillance and
   early screening, given that wells could exhibit diverse mechanisms
   throughout their life cycle. As deep learning (DL) demands a vast amount
   of information, we start our workflow by building a data set of 10,000
   publicly available oil wells that have experienced varying water
   production mechanisms. Next, we perform preprocessing and remove
   anomalies from production data, which could be deceptive in analysis.
   Then, we visualize Chan plots as images and annotate them. Thereafter,
   we split data set, carry out augmentation, and put data together to be
   used as input for a convolutional neural network (CNN) layer.
   Eventually, data are trained utilizing you only look once (YOLO)-a one
   -stage object detector, hyperparameters are tuned, and model performance
   is evaluated using mean average precision (mAP). The collected data from
   fields in Alaska and North Dakota represent oil wells that have been
   producing for decades. When working with wells that possess noisy
   production data, we recognized challenge, bias, and tedium in human
   interpretation of Chan plots. Subsequently, we observed the
   inevitability of cleaning well production data before constructing the
   plots and thoroughly revealed its effect on enhancing model potentiality
   to get a fair score. In addition, we concluded that following a
   systematic approach of active learning, a technique that allows user to
   analyze mistakes of algorithm predictions and label data accordingly,
   accomplished a significant boost in model performance, especially with
   underrepresented classes. The proposed CNN model, which uses automatic
   feature extraction and expresses data in detail, is presumed to be
   robust as it successfully predicted multiple mechanisms of excessive
   water production, with confidence scores higher than 80\%, in wells that
   exhibit different production conditions such as horizontal trajectories,
   artificial lift, waterflooding, stimulation, and other well intervention
   events. In this work, we introduce a novel computer vision model, which
   combines image processing and DL techniques to identify multiple water
   production signatures that a well can undergo and eliminate subjectivity
   of human interpretation. This approach has the potential to be
   effective, as a part of workflow automation, in expeditious surveillance
   of large oil fields. Source code is available on GitHub for public use.},

Title = {A hybrid model of self-organizing map and deep learning with genetic
   algorithm for managing energy consumption in public buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {434},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Intelligent applications have become essential for effectively managing
   energy consumption in public buildings. Energy management, especially
   for critical infrastructure buildings and public buildings, often serves
   as an example of sustainable practices since it tries to increase energy
   resilience through backup power systems. These structures were dealing
   with more difficulties, such as tight budgets, complicated regulations,
   behavioral issues, and others. Managing energy consumption in buildings
   is a multifaceted undertaking that entails grappling with non-uniform
   energy usage and a lack of established design guidelines for
   implementing energy-efficient and sustainable solutions. Consequently,
   analyzing energy utilization trends in public buildings and projecting
   future energy requirements is of paramount importance. This
   comprehension is indispensable to the identification and acknowledgment
   of energy consumption patterns in commercial and institutional
   buildings. Our research is highly significant for optimizing energy
   usage, reducing environmental impact, and making informed decisions in
   building management. We emphasize the importance of our predictive
   capabilities, sustainability, and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques
   in achieving these objectives. Our hybrid model improves energy
   efficiency while also making a significant contribution to the larger
   objective of meeting sustainability standards in the built environment
   through thorough analyses of real-world data. The goal of this study is
   to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for
   the energy usage rates of public structures. The goal of this study is
   to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for
   the energy usage rates of public structures. In order to determine the
   number of energy consumption pattern clusters, a Self-Organizing Map
   (SOM) model was utilized in conjunction with Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA). The determination of clustering levels for each
   structure was executed by utilizing K-means in conjunction with a
   Genetic algorithm (GA). This approach enabled the identification of
   optimal clustering levels for the given structures, thereby facilitating
   effective analysis and interpretation of the data. The GA was
   specifically employed to determine the optimal centroid points for each
   cluster, thus optimizing the performance of the fitting model. Cluster
   analysis pattern extraction has made determining which buildings consume
   the most energy easier. As intelligent models for predicting energy
   usage, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and CNNs paired with a GA
   have also been used. The application of a GA to modify multiple settings
   of a CNN was conducted at this stage. The CNN model using a GA shows the
   method that was used provides higher accuracy and standard error
   compared to the conventional approach. It achieves a 94.01\% accuracy on
   the training dataset and a 93.74\% accuracy on the validation dataset
   with an error rate of 0.24 and 0.26 respectively. On the training
   dataset, the accuracy is 89.03\% with a standard error of 0.3, whereas
   on the validation dataset, the accuracy is 88.91\% with a 0.33 standard
   error. This research can help policymakers in the energy sector make
   better decisions regarding the timing of energy supply and demand for
   public buildings.},

Title = {Long-Run Construction Cost Trends: Baumol's Cost Disease and a
   Disaggregate Look at Building Material Price Dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {144},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Decision-support tools for infrastructure planning assume that the real
   cost of construction (i.e.,the cost of construction when adjusting for
   inflation) will remain constant over the life cycle of a facility. This
   paper is the first of its kind to evaluate the validity of this
   assumption by assessing the long-run (i.e.,multidecade) nature of
   construction costs. This study begins by testing for the possibility
   that Baumol's cost disease, a phenomenon found in some industries in
   which labor compensation growth outpaces productivity gains, thus giving
   way to real cost growth, afflicts the construction sector. To do so, a
   series of regression models are developed using historical macroeconomic
   data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on construction costs,
   compensation, productivity, and the price of intermediate and capital
   goods. Because construction cost growth is also closely tied to price
   changes for inputs, this research extracts long-run real price trends of
   important intermediate goods used in construction through time-series
   methods applied to publicly available data from the US Bureau of Labor
   Statistics and the US Geological Survey. The results of this study
   provide strong empirical evidence that Baumol's cost disease is present
   within the construction sector, whereas the real price of most
   construction commodities has not exhibited a negative nor positive
   secular trend over the last century. These two findings suggest that,
   contrary to the conventional assumption found in current analytical
   frameworks, the real cost of construction will rise in the long run.
   This study's contribution should motivate decision-makers to re-examine
   their existing decision-support tools, because the value of policies
   that reduce project completion times and increase the service life of
   facilities is potentially much higher than currently anticipated.},

Abstract = {Technological advancements focusing on effective and efficient
   information modeling, visualization, resource tracking, and
   collaboration have gained substantial traction in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry in
   the last 10 years. The use of advanced technologies has resulted in
   safer jobsites hosting more productive project teams building more
   sustainable and resilient facilities and infrastructure. Recently, the
   innovative use of data and analytical approaches has had a major
   positive effect on a variety of businesses by incorporating data-driven
   applications and approaches. However, the AEC/FM industry is still
   lagging behind many other industries in leveraging the true power of
   data. Data analytics concepts and tools integrated with emerging
   construction trends such as building information modeling (BIM) have a
   high potential to revolutionize industry practices. This paper
   consolidates the record of current efforts in the AEC/FM body of
   knowledge (BOK) and body of practice (BOP) that incorporate the use of
   Data Analytics with common Technology Trends in various Application
   Areas. Identifying common subsections of each category, a three
   dimensional evidenced taxonomy was developed that maps (1) Data
   Analytics concepts such as cloud computing and machine learning onto,
   (2) AEC/FM emerging trends such as BIM and automation, and (3) existing
   and potential AEC/FM applications such as safety and progress
   monitoring. To further expand the validity of the results and explore
   opportunities and potential, a survey with the same categorization was
   developed and distributed among industry experts. Comparing the results
   of the exploration of the BOK and the survey illustrated the popularity
   of BIM among industry practitioners and in academic research. Also,
   process efficiency and productivity improvement were the two Application
   Areas that demonstrated the most potential to benefit from the
   integration of Data Analytics and Technology Trends. Analysis of the
   survey results indicated that, with a 95\% confidence level, there is no
   statistically significant difference among the Technology Trends or
   Application Areas, as identified in the literature, that can benefit
   from Data Analytics. The results presented in this study demonstrate
   evidence of the revolutionizing power of Data Analytics in the AEC/FM
   industry.},

Abstract = {Building a knowledge base for an intelligent system is the main goal in
   the development of any learning machine. While simple in structure,
   rigid and mathematically precise learning machines are generally
   ineffective in operating in complex environments. A learning machine
   envisioned for the physical world should also be reasonably easy to
   implement. Our daily lives and experiences suggest that human-like
   learning systems are better suited for functioning in hard-to-navigate
   environments because of their high degree of flexibility. This paper
   applies the biofunctional model of human learning to the design and
   implementation of a learning machine that is effective in navigating
   complex environments and relatively easy to design using classifier
   systems. We will portray in the case study how a Fuzzy Logic Controller
   links the system to the biofunctional model. It also makes vast
   improvements to the learning rate and the overall efficiency of the
   whole system.},

Title = {Re-estimating software effort using prior phase efforts and data mining
   techniques},

Abstract = {Software effort estimation has played an important role in software
   project management. An accurate estimation helps reduce cost overrun and
   the eventual project failure. Unfortunately, many existing estimation
   techniques rely on the total project effort which is often determined
   from the project life cycle. As the project moves on, the course of
   action deviates from what originally has planned, despite close
   monitoring and control. This leads to re-estimating software effort so
   as to improve project operating costs and budgeting. Recent research
   endeavors attempt to explore phase level estimation that uses known
   information from prior development phases to predict effort of the next
   phase by using different learning techniques. This study aims to
   investigate the influence of preprocessing in prior phases on learning
   techniques to re-estimate the effort of next phase. The proposed
   re-estimation approach preprocesses prior phase effort by means of
   statistical techniques to select a set of input features for learning
   which in turn are exploited to generate the estimation models. These
   models are then used to re-estimate next phase effort by using four
   processing steps, namely data transformation, outlier detection, feature
   selection, and learning. An empirical study is conducted on 440
   estimation models being generated from combinations of techniques on 5
   data transformation, 5 outlier detection, 5 feature selection, and 5
   learning techniques. The experimental results show that suitable
   preprocessing is significantly useful for building proper learning
   techniques to boosting re-estimation accuracy. However, there is no one
   learning technique that can outperform other techniques over all phases.
   The proposed re-estimation approach yields more accurate estimation than
   proportion-based estimation approach. It is envisioned that the proposed
   re-estimation approach can facilitate researchers and project managers
   on re-estimating software effort so as to finish the project on time and
   within the allotted budget.},

Title = {Explaining the effectiveness of performance-based logistics: a
   quantitative examination},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {324-348},
Abstract = {Purpose - Performance-based logistics (PBL) strategies are providing
   governments and for-profit organizations with a contractual mechanism
   that reduces the life cycle costs of their systems. PBL accomplishes
   this by establishing contracts that focus on the delivery of performance
   not parts. PBL establishes a metric based governance structure where
   suppliers make more profit when they invest in logistics process
   improvements, or system redesign, that reduces total cost of ownership.
   While work has been done to outline an overall PBL theoretical
   framework, the underlying theory explaining the enablers that lead to
   organizational and team-level, team-goal alignment associated with the
   PBL governance structure requires testing. The purpose of this paper is
   to quantitatively test previously posited relationships between enablers
   of PBL and PBL effectiveness. An additional objective is to explore any
   differences in PBL effectiveness between different business sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multiple regression model was developed,
   tested and validated to explain the effectiveness of PBL. The model was
   externally validated with exploratory cross-sectional survey data of 61
   practitioners.
   Findings - This study strongly supports recent PBL theory explaining PBL
   effectiveness. Key antecedents include investment climate, relational
   exchange, PBL leadership, and business sector. Further, government
   organizations lag behind their commercial counterparts in PBL
   effectiveness and PBL leadership.
   Practical implications - PBL business arrangements are more effective in
   more favorable investment climates. Thus, leaders should welcome new
   ideas, empower employees, and encourage entrepreneurship. Since PBL
   effectiveness increases with relational exchange, building trust and
   communicating with suppliers is key. Leadership is also important to PBL
   effectiveness. Leaders should accept risk, focus on long-term
   affordability and performance, and align activities to achieve end-user
   goals.
   Originality/value - This research is the first quantitative test of
   previously posited factors affecting PBL effectiveness. Additionally,
   this research unveils key differences in business sectors' use of PBL
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Forensic DNA phenotyping refers to an emerging field of forensic
   sciences aimed at the prediction of externally visible characteristics
   of unknown sample donors directly from biological materials. The aging
   process significantly affects most of the above characteristics making
   the development of a reliable method of age prediction very important.
   Today, the so-called ``epigenetic clocks{''} represent the most accurate
   models for age prediction. Since they are technically not achievable in
   a typical forensic laboratory, forensic DNA technology has triggered
   efforts toward the simplification of these models. The present study
   aimed to build an epigenetic clock using a set of methylation markers of
   five different genes in a sample of the Italian population of different
   ages covering the whole span of adult life. In a sample of 330 subjects,
   42 selected markers were analyzed with a machine learning approach for
   building a prediction model for age prediction. A ridge linear
   regression model including eight of the proposed markers was identified
   as the best performing model across a plethora of candidates. This model
   was tested on an independent sample of 83 subjects providing a median
   error of 4.5 years. In the present study, an epigenetic model for age
   prediction was validated in a sample of the Italian population. However,
   its applicability to advanced ages still represents the main limitation
   in forensic caseworks.},

Title = {Fiber-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete with crumb rubber: A
   state-of-the-art review},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {404},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The growing population demands rapid development of infrastructures.
   However, the construction industry is searching for environmentally
   sustainable and eco-friendly building materials to fight climate change.
   Millions of tires are discarded globally, and only certain percentages
   are recycled. The use of rubber tires as a natural aggregate replacement
   in concrete has gained popularity among the research community in the
   past few years, primarily due to its ductility and toughness properties.
   A significant number of investigations have been reported in the past
   using recycled coarse aggregates (RCA), crumb rubber (CR), and fibers
   separately in concrete. The results revealed that the addition of rubber
   particles along with RCA in concrete reduced the strength. However, the
   inclusion of fibers in the same mixtures significantly improved the
   mechanical properties of concrete by acting as a bridge within the
   concrete matrix for the surrounding cracks. In this review paper, over
   220 research articles from the last 30 years reporting the effect of
   RCA, CR, and fibers on the mechanical and physical properties of
   rubberized recycled aggregate concrete (RRAC) and fiber-reinforced
   rubberized recycled aggregate concrete (FRRAC) are summarized. This
   paper presents in detail the influencing factors that affect the
   physical and mechanical properties of RRAC and FRRAC. The performance of
   FRRAC depends on the types of fiber and CR, treatment of CR, RCA
   sources, and the mix design of concrete. Based on the review,
   recommendations are provided for optimized FRRAC production. Simplified
   equations have been proposed to predict the tensile and flexural
   strength and modulus of elasticity of RRAC and FRRAC. An overview of
   predicting the mechanical properties of rubberized concrete using
   different machine-learning algorithms has been presented. Finally, this
   review paper will help scholars understand the use of RCA and CR in
   concrete as aggregate replacement materials and create waste material
   utilization opportunities for the sustainable green construction
   industry.},

Abstract = {Processing carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate oxygen (O-2) is one of the
   challenges in developing life support systems for human presence in
   space. Algae is known for growing its biomass through photosynthesis,
   producing O-2, and fixing CO2 400 times more efficiently than trees.
   Algae cultivation in a controlled environment requires maintaining
   proper conditions to extend healthy culture growth and life cycles.
   Terrestrially, relatively large facilities (raceway ponds) cultivate
   algae. This is not adequate for the integration into spacecraft or
   buildings due to mass and volume constraints. These large terrestrial
   systems do not fully utilize artificial intelligence (AI), based on data
   analysis, to achieve optimal growth. Hypergiant developed a small-scale
   bioreactor prototype as a commercial and open-source platform, focused
   on addressing life support systems in space and the growing concern of
   climate change. This autonomous system is grouped into several design
   aspects such as mechanical, electronics, sensors, and data monitoring.
   Sensor clusters collected measurements about the biological and
   environmental status. Then, AI algorithms utilized these data, such as
   the concentration of O-2 and CO2, pH, turbidity, temperature, and
   optical density to automatically adjust the cultivation environment by
   cascade control. In this study, we formulate the CO2 absorption process
   model and define input and output parameters. We also present the
   results of testing an optical density sensor developed in-house. The
   results indicated that the optical density sensor has high accuracy and
   repeatability over a range of light intensities, capable of measuring a
   dense algal culture. The desktop dashboard presented the integrated
   platform, including input measurement data from the sensor array and
   resulting automatic output controls. Additional applications, including
   terrestrial use, and future work with this platform are included. AI
   helps to find optimal operational conditions for growing algae in
   multiple bioreactors within a distributed network, thereby maximizing
   the efficiency of CO2 sequestration and O-2 production, while lowering
   power consumption. Refining this innovative bioreactor system helps
   realize a viable solution for closed-loop life support in a human space
   habitat and helps fight climate change by compensating for carbon
   footprint in various terrestrial settings.},

Title = {Integral Evaluation of Implementation Efficiency of Automated Hardware

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Reducing the speed of the vehicle can reduce the risk and severity of
   the collision. Automatic means of vehicle traffic operation control,
   such as automatic speed cameras, is one of the main methods to solve
   traffic violations such as speeding. This study takes the actual
   operation of the automated hardware complex for vehicle traffic control
   in the Russian Federation as the research objective, and discusses the
   impact of the application of automated hardware complex for vehicle
   traffic control on traffic safety. In the process of building the
   automated traffic flow monitoring system of urban agglomeration, it is
   necessary to form a set of methodology to evaluate the hardware complex
   of traffic infrastructure. According to the research results of the
   influence of vehicle traffic automation and control system on road
   safety, a model, method and algorithm were developed to evaluate the
   efficiency of automated hardware complex for vehicle traffic control.
   The relevant factors introduced into the intelligent transportation
   system for the overall evaluation of the application efficiency of the
   vehicle traffic operation control automation hardware complex were
   determined. A life cycle model of automated hardware complex for vehicle
   traffic operation control was established to evaluate its operation
   efficiency in the development stage of intelligent transportation
   system, and on this basis, the maneuverability standard of urban
   agglomeration traffic monitoring system management is determined. The
   results show that the number of hardware complexes used in vehicle
   traffic operation control has a positive impact on the road traffic
   accident rate. It is suggested that the standard of one hardware complex
   for every 6.5 thousand registered vehicles in this area should be used
   as an indicator of the equipment level of the integrated automated
   system for vehicle traffic control in this area.},

Abstract = {An IT Project Manager is responsible for project planning, estimating
   and scheduling, developing and monitoring the progress throughout its
   development life cycle. The selection of a particular methodology is
   heuristic and the performance of the system developed is unpredictable.
   The authors suggest that a designed process performance model (PPM) can
   help to predict the required factors of a process to help achieve set
   goals for the process. This, in turn, can help to control factors that
   the project and the organizations need to control and ensure expected
   results. PPMs may enable to work out the relationship between different
   variables for a well-defined project and this knowledge becomes basis
   for prediction of performance solution, and helps in implementation of
   solution. This approach related to designing of PPMs, for various real
   life projects situations has not been attempted by industry in a big
   way. The authors demonstrate how to work out the PPMs, based on the
   given inputs of projects, by an Indian IT company. The solution works
   out number of bids which arrive at a given time or predict when the next
   bid will arrive at service centre, based on time series and queuing
   theory approach. This solution approach is based on different problems
   that will become the basis to build PPMs for similar problems. The
   problems discussed here are from an Information Technology Company, with
   real life data from the projects under development. Testing these models
   with more projects data thus will formalize how to build PPMs in a
   similar way. The authors discuss problem areas where time series and
   queuing theory Models can be applied and benefits of the present
   approach. The authors have similarly worked on different mathematical
   models based on industry data and build PPMs based on Bayesian,
   regression, fuzzy logic and other models. This paper is submitted with
   only two models just to prove the concept. In future building PPMs is
   likely to be a necessity in high maturity IT organizations.},

Abstract = {Buildings consume a significant amount of energy throughout their
   lifecycle; Thus, sustainable energy management is crucial for all
   buildings, and controlling energy consumption has become increasingly
   important for achieving sustainable construction. Digital twin (DT)
   technology, which lies at the core of Industry 4.0, has gained
   widespread adoption in various fields, including building energy
   analysis. With the ability to monitor, optimize, and predict building
   energy consumption in real time. DT technology has enabled sustainable
   building energy management and cost reduction. This paper provides a
   comprehensive review of the development and application of DT technology
   in building energy. Specifically, it discusses the background of
   building information modeling (BIM) and DT technology and their
   application in energy optimization in buildings. Additionally, this
   article reviews the application of DT technology in building energy
   management, indoor environmental monitoring, and building energy
   efficiency evaluation. It also examines the benefits and challenges of
   implementing DT technology in building energy analysis and highlights
   recent case studies. Furthermore, this review emphasizes emerging trends
   and opportunities for future research, including integrating machine
   learning techniques with DT technology. The use of DT technology in the
   energy sector is gaining momentum as efforts to optimize energy
   efficiency and reduce carbon emissions continue. The advancement of
   building energy analysis and machine learning technologies is expected
   to enhance prediction accuracy, optimize energy efficiency, and improve
   management processes. These advancements have become the focal point of
   current literature and have the potential to facilitate the transition
   to clean energy, ultimately achieving sustainable development goals.},

Abstract = {Data driven technologies are revolutionising the engineering sector by
   providing new ways of performing day to day tasks through the life cycle
   of a product as it progresses through manufacture, to build,
   qualification test, field operation and maintenance. Significant
   increase in data transfer speeds combined with cost effective data
   storage, and ever-increasing computational power provide the building
   blocks that enable companies to adopt data driven technologies such as
   data analytics, IOT and machine learning. Improved business operational
   efficiency and more responsive customer support provide the incentives
   for business investment. Digital twins, that leverages these
   technologies in their various forms to converge physics and data driven
   models, are therefore being widely adopted.
   A high-fidelity multi-physics digital twin, HFDT, that digitally
   replicates a gas turbine as it is built based on part and build data
   using advanced component and assembly models is introduced. The HFDT,
   among other benefits enables data driven assessments to be carried out
   during manufacture and assembly for each turbine allowing these
   processes to be optimised and the impact of variability or process
   change to be readily evaluated. On delivery of the turbine and its
   associated HFDT to the service support team the HFDT supports the
   evaluation of in-service performance deteriorations, the impact of field
   interventions and repair and the changes in operating characteristics
   resulting from overhaul and turbine upgrade. Thus, creating a cradle to
   grave physics and data driven twin of the gas turbine asset.
   In this paper, one branch of HFDT using a power turbine module is
   firstly presented. This involves simultaneous modelling of gas path and
   solid using high fidelity CFD and FEA which converts the cold geometry
   to hot running conditions to assess the impact of various manufacturing
   and build variabilities. It is shown this process can be executed within
   reasonable time frames enabling creation of HFDT for each turbine during
   manufacture and assembly and for this to be transferred to the service
   team for deployment during field operations.
   Following this, it is shown how data driven technologies are used in
   conjunction with the HFDT to improve predictions of engine performance
   from early build information. The example shown, shows how a higher
   degree of confidence is achieved through the development of an
   artificial neural network of the compressor tip gap feature and its
   effect on overall compressor efficiency.},

Abstract = {Data management is the most challenging aspect of building Machine
   Learning (ML) systems. ML systems can read large volumes of historical
   data when training models, but inference workloads are more varied,
   depending on whether it is a batch or online ML system. The feature
   store for ML has recently emerged as a single data platform for managing
   ML data throughout the ML lifecycle, from feature engineering to model
   training to inference.
   In this paper, we present the Hopsworks feature store for machine
   learning as a highly available platform for managing feature data with
   API support for columnar, row-oriented, and similarity search query
   workloads. We introduce and address challenges solved by the feature
   stores related to feature reuse, how to organize data transformations,
   and how to ensure correct and consistent data between feature
   engineering, model training, and model inference. We present the
   engineering challenges in building high-performance query services for a
   feature store and show how Hopsworks outperforms existing cloud feature
   stores for training and online inference query workloads.},

Title = {Performance-based wind engineering for roof cladding based on
   vulnerability analysis of roof plate unit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {In response to frequent wind damage accidents in roof cladding, a
   performance-based wind engineering framework for roof cladding is
   proposed, taking the roof plate unit as the research object. In the
   uncertain analysis part, extreme wind pressures in each zone of the roof
   are evaluated using the independent storm method. In the vulnerability
   analysis part, a large number of numerical simulations are carried out
   based on Latin hypercube sampling to obtain the probability
   vulnerability curves of various types of roof plate units through
   regression fitting. In the loss analysis part, a total life cycle cost
   model of the roof cladding is established considering initial cost and
   wind disaster losses. In the performance target part, wind load levels
   and performance levels are divided based on the extreme wind pressure in
   each zone of roof under various return periods and the wind uplift
   failure process of roof plates respectively. Combined with wind load
   levels and performance levels, performance targets that can be selected
   by owners are proposed. The application of performance-based wind
   engineering is introduced using a flat roof as an example, which shows
   that the probability of reaching insignificant, moderate damage, and
   moderate damage under recurrence periods of 10, 50, and 100 years for a
   certain type of roof plate unit is 89 \%, 91 \%, and 72 \%,
   respectively, which meets the owner's performance objectives and can be
   applied to guide the wind-resistant design of the cladding of the flat
   roof. Compared with the complexity of existing performance-based wind
   engineering, the performance-based wind engineering proposed in this
   manuscript can coordinate with the traditional wind- resistant design
   method of roof cladding, and can ensure the economy of design results.},

Title = {Architectural patterns for the design of federated learning systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {191},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Federated learning has received fast-growing interests from academia and
   industry to tackle the challenges of data hungriness and privacy in
   machine learning. A federated learning system can be viewed as a
   large-scale distributed system with different components and
   stakeholders as numerous client devices participate in federated
   learning. Designing a federated learning system requires software system
   design thinking apart from the machine learning knowledge. Although much
   effort has been put into federated learning from the machine learning
   technique aspects, the software architecture design concerns in building
   federated learning systems have been largely ignored. Therefore, in this
   paper, we present a collection of architectural patterns to deal with
   the design challenges of federated learning systems. Architectural
   patterns present reusable solutions to a commonly occurring problem
   within a given context during software architecture design. The
   presented patterns are based on the results of a systematic literature
   review and include three client management patterns, four model
   management patterns, three model training patterns, four model
   aggregation patterns, and one configuration pattern. The patterns are
   associated to the particular state transitions in a federated learning
   model lifecycle, serving as a guidance for effective use of the patterns
   in the design of federated learning systems. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All

   with the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Technologies and
   methodologies constantly enrich the building industry because the amount
   of data generated during different building stages is considerable and
   has a tremendous effect on the lifecycle of a building. Previous
   research underscores the importance of seamlessly exchanging information
   between physical and digital assets within a comprehensive framework,
   particularly emphasizing the integration of BIM data with various
   systems to enhance efficiency and prevent information loss. Despite
   advancements in technologies, challenges persist in optimizing methods
   for integrating BIM data into DT frameworks, including ensuring
   interoperability, scalability, and real-time monitor and control. This
   study addresses this research gap by proposing a comprehensive platform
   that integrates the DT concept with IoT and BIM technologies. The
   platform is developed in five main stages: 1) acquiring electronic data
   of the building from the laser scanner, 2) developing a Wi-Fi IoT module
   and BIM data for physical assets and digital replica, 3) constructing
   the DT elements of the platform, 4) performing data analysis 5)
   implementing thermal comfort prediction models. Two machine learning
   models (Facebook prophet, NeuralProphet) are implemented to predict
   thermal comfort. The best predictive model is identified by evaluating
   its error function using historical training data collected during
   facility operation. A case study demonstrates the practical application
   of the proposed framework. The case study involves a real building where
   the platform is implemented to monitor and control indoor environments.
   By utilizing predefined data in BIM models, the platform ensures data
   accuracy, consistency, and usability. The case outputs reveal that
   Neuralprophet provides good prediction results.},

Abstract = {The adoption of Building Performance Simulation for decision-making
   during the early phases of design would help improve the building's
   lifecycle performance. One important challenge, however, is that most
   building parameters are not yet finalized during such early phases;
   hence, an extensive number of design scenarios will exist to be
   simulated. Given that mathematical simulation of building performance is
   a computationally expensive problem, the simulation of many building
   scenarios becomes unfeasible during the design phase. Worst of all, a
   considerable number of such design scenarios end up being inferior to
   the code baselines and are only wasting computational time and power. To
   decrease the number of scenarios to be simulated during the
   decision-making of building parameters, this paper uses machine learning
   to build a recommender system, capable of identifying and filtering out
   the scenarios with worse performance than the building code's baseline,
   without performing energy simulation. This goal is achieved by training
   six different classifiers and selecting the one that best achieves the
   objective. After model evaluation and comparison, it was found that the
   artificial neural network (ANN) model has the best performance among the
   tested classifiers. The ANN model is hence used for the development of a
   recommender system to support simulation-based decision-making for
   selecting design parameters during the early phases of building design.},

Abstract = {In the past decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved
   unprecedented success, where statistical models become the central
   entity in AI. However, the centralized training and inference paradigm
   for building and using these models is facing more and more privacy and
   legal challenges. To bridge the gap between data privacy and the need
   for data fusion, an emerging AI paradigm federated learning (FL) has
   emerged as an approach for solving data silos and data privacy problems.
   Based on secure distributed AI, federated learning emphasizes data
   security throughout the lifecycle, which includes the following steps:
   data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployments. FL keeps data
   security by using methods, such as secure multi-party computation (MPC),
   differential privacy, and hardware solutions, to build and use
   distributed multiple-party machine-learning systems and statistical
   models over different data sources. Besides data privacy concerns, we
   argue that the concept of ``model{''} matters, when developing and
   deploying federated models, they are easy to expose to various kinds of
   risks including plagiarism, illegal copy, and misuse. To address these
   issues, we introduce FedIPR, a novel ownership verification scheme, by
   embedding watermarks into FL models to verify the ownership of FL models
   and protect model intellectual property rights (IPR or IP-right for
   short). While security is at the core of FL, there are still many
   articles referred to distributed machine learning with no security
   guarantee as ``federated learning{''}, which are not satisfied with the
   FL definition supposed to be. To this end, in this paper, we reiterate
   the concept of federated learning and propose secure federated learning
   (SFL), where the ultimate goal is to build trustworthy and safe AI with
   strong privacy-preserving and IP-right-preserving. We provide a
   comprehensive overview of existing works, including threats, attacks,
   and defenses in each phase of SFL from the lifecycle perspective.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is
   experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation
   and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology
   and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM),
   machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention
   owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven
   underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation
   as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are
   valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and
   maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the
   processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of
   BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction
   represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use
   in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the
   state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning,
   computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the
   digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1
   presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2
   introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals.
   Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and
   highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and
   geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4
   examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at
   different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the
   challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these
   emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and
   information integration throughout underground project lifecycle.
   Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps
   and future directions.},

Abstract = {Purpose At the end of a building's lifecycle, there are several
   limitations to the decision-making process (DMP). There is a lack of
   data available from the building's history, the difficulty in assessing
   the condition of a building and the variety of stakeholders' needs that
   have to be satisfied. The purpose of this paper is to answer the
   question: how would end-of-life (EOL) DMP change when buildings will
   have been digitally built? The answer will be illustrated through a
   conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative analysis
   of the existing literature has been performed to identify the elements
   within building information modelling (BIM) and advanced digital
   technologies that could be of support to the DMP. The findings have been
   collected and summarised in a conceptual framework that has been
   validated and enhanced through online interviews with industry experts.
   Findings The enhanced framework has identified that BIM technology would
   bring the benefit of providing the initial digital data source, from
   which machine learning and data analytics would then extract the
   relevant data needed to measure accurately the criteria during the
   analysis of the EOL options put on the table. Originality/value The
   findings of this research could contribute to developing the software
   modules making the bridge between BIM and machine learning technologies,
   to implement them in the EOL DMP.},

Title = {An eco-social exploration of tourism area evolution in mountains through
   stakeholders' perspective},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study delves into the intricate interplay between intrinsic and
   extrinsic influencers that shape the multidimensional eco-social spheres
   through the process of tourism area evolution (TAE) in a mountain
   tourist destination, Sikkim, located in the Eastern Himalayas.
   Understanding the ecosocial aspects from the perspective of local
   communities in the Himalayan region has been challenging due to the
   overlapping and entangled ecological and social relations in the
   mountains, which lack a comprehensive and systematic assessment
   framework. To address this gap, the study incorporates 300 stakeholders'
   perspectives from five distinct groups, with the objective of
   constructing an explanatory model that combines qualitative and
   quantitative methodologies. This analysis was conducted within the
   framework of the widely recognized tourism area life cycle (TALC) model.
   Also, it integrated participatory appraisal with robust statistical
   modelling techniques, including Kruskal-Wallis Test, Principal Component
   Analysis, Analysis of Variance and Multinomial Logistic Regression to
   detangle the influence of internal and external factors on the
   eco-social structure of Sikkim. The results reveal that the status of
   TAE is uneven across Sikkim, predominantly influenced by diverse
   geoclimatic, geopolitical, environmental, economic, infrastructural, and
   sociocultural factors, as well as the capacity of the destination to
   cope with external changes. The study further identifies that the
   high-altitude destinations under protected and restricted areas, which
   are major attractions in Sikkim, are more vulnerable due to their
   relatively high socioecological sensitivity, posing challenges to future
   tourism development. However, based on the TALC framework and the
   stakeholders' perception-based model, the study predicts that the
   likelihood of Sikkim approaching the stagnation stage is low, unless
   phenomenon like climate (change), social security and environmental
   degradation trigger it. Albeit the greater concerns are for features
   (social structure, local-tourists interaction, seasonality and
   ecological disturbances) that potentially exhibit characteristics of
   consolidation. The key findings highlight the significance of the
   uniqueness, tradition, cultural heritage, basic amenities and
   community's capacity to cope with external changes may sustain tourism
   in Sikkim. Hence, the study advocates for a prioritized focus on
   capacity building through community-based participation, with special
   emphasis on the high-altitude destinations, as a crucial step towards
   ensuring the long-term sustainability of (eco)tourism and the
   preservation of the eco-social environment in Sikkim.},

   additional efforts, the characteristics of V-Model align effectively
   with several collaboration challenges encountered by practitioners when

Title = {Generation Method for HVAC Systems Design Schemes in Office Buildings
   Based on Deep Graph Generative Models},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The design process of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
   systems is complex and time consuming due to the need to follow design
   codes. Since the design standards are not fixed, the final outcome often
   depends on the designer's experience. The development of building
   information modeling (BIM) technology has made information throughout
   the building lifecycle more integrated. BIM-based forward design is now
   widely used, providing a data foundation for combining HVAC system
   design with machine learning. This paper proposes an unsupervised
   learning method based on deep graph generative models to uncover hidden
   design patterns and optimization strategies from the design results. We
   trained and validated four deep graph generative models-GAE, GNF, GAN,
   and diffusion-using HVAC system terminal pipeline layout data. Accuracy
   and precision metrics were used to compare the generated designs with
   automated forward design solutions, assessing the models' ability to
   capture both local variations and broader changes in design logic. A
   graph-neural-network-based evaluation method was employed to measure the
   models' capacity to detect changes. The results indicate that all four
   models achieved prediction accuracies exceeding 90\% and precision rates
   above 75\%. The models effectively captured both local modifications
   made by designers and global design changes, showing greater sensitivity
   to global layout adjustments than to local updates. When comparing the
   results generated by deep graph generative models and the actual design,
   it is obvious that the accuracy of the predictions varies significantly
   due to the complexity of the test buildings.},

Abstract = {In sensing-enabled mobile infrastructure, the network itself acts as a
   whole sensor by leveraging radio data or signals collected within Base
   Stations (BSs). This data is exploited for the development of
   data-driven machine learning solutions to augment network's
   capabilities. Nevertheless, large-scale qualitative data is required for
   achieving high accuracy learning. However, their training phase leads to
   prohibitive cost and heavy constraints on data collection and storage
   that are not desirable for network. To overcome this problem, we propose
   to use synthetic data instead of real data for training machine learning
   models to avoid high cost data sharing/storage. In this paper, we are
   interested in real-life Environment Sensing Network in a context of
   limited data amount sharing. We focus on Indoor-Outdoor Detection (IOD)
   using unsupervised machine learning classification models. For this
   purpose, experiments are conducted following the paradigm of Training on
   Synthetic data and Testing on Real Data (TSTR). We conduct a comparative
   study of four well-known generative models, that are able to generate
   synthetic 3GPP radio data with similar distribution than the source
   data. We investigate the quality of these synthetic generated radio data
   according to three dimensions: distribution similarity, data variability
   and detection capability. The classification models trained with
   synthetic generated data are tested in real-life context to infer
   whether a user connected to the network is inside or outside a building.
   The study shows convincing results with an Indoor/Outdoor unsupervised
   classification performance up to 80\% of F1 - score like in real-life
   data training scenarios.},

Title = {Serverless on Machine Learning: A Systematic Mapping Study},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {99337-99352},
Abstract = {Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is an approach to managing the
   entire lifecycle of a machine learning model. It has evolved over the
   last years and has started attracting many people in research and
   businesses in the industry. It supports the development of machine
   learning (ML) pipelines typical in the phases of data collection, data
   pre-processing, building datasets, model training, hyper-parameters
   refinement, testing, and deployment to production. This complex pipeline
   workflow is a tedious process of iterative experimentation. Moreover,
   cloud computing services provide advanced features for managing ML
   stages and deploying them efficiently to production. Specifically,
   serverless computing has been applied in different stages of the machine
   learning pipeline. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is missing
   to know the serverless suitability and benefits it can provide to the ML
   pipeline. In this paper, we provide a systematic mapping study of
   machine learning systems applied on serverless architecture that include
   53 relevant studies. During this study, we focused on (1) exploring the
   evolution trend and the main venues; (2) determining the researchers'
   focus and interest in using serverless on machine learning; (3)
   discussing solutions that serverless computing provides to machine
   learning. Our results show that serverless usage is growing, and several
   venues are interested in the topic. In addition, we found that the most
   widely used serverless provider is AWS Lambda, where the primary
   application was used in the deployment of the ML model. Additionally,
   several challenges were explored, such as reducing cost, resource
   scalability, and reducing latency. We also discuss the potential
   challenges of adopting ML on serverless, such as respecting service
   level agreement, the cold start problem, security, and privacy. Finally,
   our contribution provides foundations for future research and
   applications that involve machine learning in serverless computing.},

Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistant infections are a serious public health threat
   worldwide. Whole genome sequencing approaches to rapidly identify
   pathogens and predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes are becoming more
   feasible and may offer a way to reduce clinical test turnaround times
   compared to conventional culture-based methods, and in turn, improve
   patient outcomes. In this study, we use whole genome sequence data from
   1668 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to develop a
   XGBoost-based machine learning model that accurately predicts minimum
   inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 20 antibiotics. The overall
   accuracy of the model, within +/- 1 two-fold dilution factor, is 92\%.
   Individual accuracies are >= 90\% for 15/20 antibiotics. We show that
   the MICs predicted by the model correlate with known antimicrobial
   resistance genes. Importantly, the genome-wide approach described in
   this study offers a way to predict MICs for isolates without knowledge
   of the underlying gene content. This study shows that machine learning
   can be used to build a complete in silico MIC prediction panel for K.
   pneumoniae and provides a framework for building MIC prediction models
   for other pathogenic bacteria.},

Abstract = {Recent introduction of data mining methods has led to a paradigm shift
   in the way we can analyze space data. This paper demonstrates that
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially the field of Knowledge
   Representation and Reasoning (KRR), could also be successfully employed
   at the start of the space mission life cycle via an Expert System (ES)
   used as a Design Engineering Assistant (DEA). An ES is an AI-based agent
   used to solve complex problems in particular fields. There are many
   examples of ES being successfully implemented in the aeronautical,
   agricultural, legal or medical fields. Applied to space mission design,
   and in particular, in the context of concurrent engineering sessions, an
   ES could serve as a knowledge engine and support the generation of the
   initial design inputs, provide easy and quick access to previous design
   decisions or push to explore new design options. Integrated to the User
   design environment, the DEA could become an active assistant following
   the design iterations and flagging model inconsistencies.
   Today, for space missions design, experts apply methods of concurrent
   engineering and Model-Based System Engineering, relying both on their
   implicit knowledge (i.e., past experiences, network) and on available
   explicit knowledge (i.e., past reports, publications, data sheets). The
   former knowledge type represents still the most significant amount of
   data, mostly unstructured, non-digital or digital data of various legacy
   formats. Searching for information through this data is highly
   time-consuming. A solution is to convert this data into structured data
   to be stored into a Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be traversed by an
   inference engine to provide reasoning and deductions on its nodes.
   Knowledge is extracted from the KG via a User Interface (UI) and a query
   engine providing reliable and relevant knowledge summaries to the Human
   experts. The DEA project aims to enhance the productivity of experts by
   providing them with new insights into a large amount of data accumulated
   in the field of space mission design. Natural Language Processing (NLP),
   Machine Learning (ML), Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Machine
   Interaction (HMI) methods are leveraged to develop the DEA. Building the
   knowledge base manually is subjective, time-consuming, laborious and
   error bound. This is why the knowledge base generation and population
   rely on Ontology Learning (OL) methods. This OL approach follows a
   modified model of the Ontology Layer Cake. This paper describes the
   approach and the parameters used for the qualitative trade-off for the
   selection of the software to be adopted in the architecture of the ES.
   The study also displays the first results of the multi-word extraction
   and highlights the importance of Word Sense Disambiguation for the
   identification of synonyms in the context. This paper includes the
   detailed software architecture of both front and back-ends, as well as
   the tool requirements. Both architectures and requirements were refined
   after a set of interviews with experts from the European Space Agency.
   The paper finally presents the preliminary strategy to quantify and
   mitigate uncertainties within the ES.},

Pages = {259-284},
Abstract = {Compared with other industries, the use of big data is substantially
   less developed in the architecture, construction, engineering, and
   operation (AECO) industry. Available examples are mostly experimental,
   limited in scope, and without an obvious transfer to practice. Yet, a
   substantial number of academics and practitioners envision that the use
   of big data will have a significant impact on how decisions are made in
   the building design process, providing designers with an unprecedented
   amount of exceptionally detailed data on buildings and their occupants
   that is redefining what can be observed, modeled, simulated, predicted
   and measured in the industry. We first review the main concepts and
   technologies that shape this technological phenomenon, and then, based
   on the survey of around 100 cases of applications of big data and
   machine learning throughout all phases of building design we identify 12
   clusters of applications where the technology seems to be more
   disruptive. The discussion then focuses on the transformative impacts of
   the technology on three niches where further research is more urgently
   needed: 1) understanding the design problem; 2) simulating and
   predicting the holistic performance of the design solution; 3)
   evaluating integrally and continuously the design product during its

Abstract = {Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is an integral component in a wide range
   of areas, including software analytics (SA) and business intelligence
   (BI). As a result, the interest in custom ML-based software analytics
   and business intelligence solutions is rising. In practice, however,
   such solutions often get stuck in a prototypical stage because setting
   up an infrastructure for deployment and maintenance is considered
   complex and time-consuming. For this reason, we aim at structuring the
   entire process and making it more transparent by deriving an end-to-end
   framework from existing literature for building and deploying ML-based
   software analytics and business intelligence solutions. The framework is
   structured in three iterative cycles representing different stages in a
   model's lifecycle: prototyping, deployment, update. As a result, the
   framework specifically supports the transitions between these stages
   while also covering all important activities from data collection to
   retraining deployed ML models. To validate the applicability of the
   framework in practice, we compare it to and apply it in a real-world
   ML-based SA/BI solution.},

Title = {Impact of Historical Software Metric Changes in Predicting Future
   Maintainability Trends in Open-Source Software Development},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Featured Application The paper shows that the additional layers of
   historical changes of software metrics from previous software releases
   contributes to a better prediction of future software maintainability.
   Software maintenance is one of the key stages in the software lifecycle
   and it includes a variety of activities that consume the significant
   portion of the costs of a software project. Previous research suggest
   that future software maintainability can be predicted, based on various
   source code aspects, but most of the research focuses on the prediction
   based on the present state of the code and ignores its history. While
   taking the history into account in software maintainability prediction
   seems intuitive, the research empirically testing this has not been
   done, and is the main goal of this paper. This paper empirically
   evaluates the contribution of historical measurements of the Chidamber
   \& Kemerer (C\&K) software metrics to software maintainability
   prediction models. The main contribution of the paper is the building of
   the prediction models with classification and regression trees and
   random forest learners in iterations by adding historical measurement
   data extracted from previous releases gradually. The maintainability
   prediction models were built based on software metric measurements
   obtained from real-world open-source software projects. The analysis of
   the results show that an additional amount of historical metric
   measurements contributes to the maintainability prediction.
   Additionally, the study evaluates the contribution of individual C\&K
   software metrics on the performance of maintainability prediction
   models.},

Title = {Natural Hazard Influence Model of Maintenance and Repair Cost for
   Sustainable Accommodation Facilities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To optimally maintain buildings and other built infrastructure, the
   costs of managing them during their entire existence-that is, lifecycle
   costs-must be taken into account. However, due to technological
   improvements, developers now build more high-rise and high-performance
   buildings, meaning that new approaches to estimating lifecycle costs are
   needed. Meanwhile, an accelerating process of industrialization around
   the world means that global warming is also accelerating, and the damage
   caused by natural disasters due to climate change is increasing.
   However, the costs of losses related to such hazards are rarely
   incorporated into lifecycle-cost estimation techniques. Accordingly,
   this study explored the relationship between, on the one hand, some
   known parameters of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, high winds,
   and/or flooding, and on the other hand, the data on exceptional
   maintenance costs, represented by gross loss costs, generated by a large
   international hotel chain from 2007 to 2017. The regression model used
   revealed a correlation between heavy rain and insurance-claim payouts.
   This and other results can usefully inform safety and design guidelines
   for policymakers, both in disaster management and real estate, as well
   as in insurance companies},

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is at the forefront of the rising popularity of
   data-driven software applications. The resulting rapid proliferation of
   ML technology, explosive data growth, and shortage of data science
   expertise have caused the industry to face increasingly challenging
   demands to keep up with fast-paced develop-and-deploy model lifecycles.
   Recent academic and industrial research efforts have started to address
   this problem through automated machine learning (AutoML) pipelines and
   have focused on model performance as the first-order design objective.
   We present Oracle AutoML, a novel iteration-free AutoML pipeline
   designed to not only provide accurate models, but also in a shorter
   runtime. We are able to achieve these objectives by eliminating the need
   to continuously iterate over various pipeline configurations. In our
   feed-forward approach, each pipeline stage makes decisions based on
   metalearned proxy models that can predict candidate pipeline
   configuration performances before building the full final model. Our
   approach, which builds and tunes only the best candidate pipeline,
   achieves better scores at a fraction of the time compared to
   state-of-the-art open source AutoML tools, such as H2O and Auto-sklearn.
   This makes Oracle AutoML a prime candidate for addressing current
   industry challenges.},

Title = {A co-simulated material-component-system-district framework for
   climate-adaption and sustainability transition},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {192},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to considerable carbon emissions in building sectors, sustainability
   transformation is essential for power supply reliability, stability,
   grid-friendly interaction, and integration with e-transportation.
   However, building sustainability transformation requires
   inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary platforms for
   `material-component-building-district' co-simulations and innovations.
   In this study, a generic methodology is proposed to comprehensively
   interconnect nano-scale material and energy systems in thermal transport
   and thermodynamics, guiding the design and operation for lifecycle
   sustainability, together with carbon intensity quantification and
   decarbonisation potential. Afterwards, a cross-scale energy simulation
   platform is formulated, involving nanoporous materials, innovative
   components, building integrations, and district energy analytics. The
   formulated platform can enable synthetical and comprehensive analysis on
   thermodynamic performances, energy performances, energy conversion and
   management, throughout integrated cross-disciplinary approaches by
   overcoming performance overestimation or underestimation of traditional
   single-stage approaches. The application of the platform quantifies the
   decreasing magnitude of energy consumption for PCM microcapsule wall,
   self-cleaning facade coating, clear thermal resistant cleaning glass
   coating, evaporative cooling \& solar PV roof, volatile organic compound
   (VOC) absorption for indoor air quality (IAQ) control, building
   integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), solar thermal collectors and 10-kW
   wind turbine. Afterwards, dynamic interaction between real buildings and
   digital twin models was realized for fast computation and prediction,
   labour cost and initial investment cost saving, long-term performance
   analysis. Both historical database and digital twin-generated database
   can promote the development of machine learning (ML) models, through
   data preparation, hyperparameter optimization, model training, testing,
   and validation. The proposed approach and formulated platform can enable
   synthetical and comprehensive analysis on building sustainability,
   throughout integrated crossdisciplinary approaches for 2060 carbon
   neutrality in China.},

Abstract = {Smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time and robust
   predictive analytics, which are based on Machine Learning (ML) models.
   Building ML models from Big Data is not only time-consuming, but
   developers often lack the needed expertise for feature engineering,
   parameter tuning, and model selection. The proliferation of ML libraries
   and frameworks, data ingestion tools, stream and batch processing
   engines, visualization techniques, and the range of available hardware
   platforms further exacerbates the system design, rapid development, and
   deployment problems. Finally, resource constraints of IoT require that
   the execution of the analytics engine be distributed across the
   cloud-edge spectrum. To overcome these daunting challenges, we present
   Stratum, which is an event-driven Big Data-as-a-Service offering for IoT
   analytics lifecycle management. Stratum provides users with an
   intuitive, declarative mechanism based on the principles of model-driven
   engineering to specify the application and infrastructure requirements.
   It automates the deployment via generative programming principles. This
   paper highlights the problems that Stratum resolves, demonstrating its
   capabilities using real-world case studies.},

Abstract = {An essential attribute of the software quality is maintainability which
   incurs almost 60-70\% of total project cost. Since software
   maintainability prediction is a complicated process; estimating
   maintainability in the prior phases of software development lifecycle
   (SDLC) is advantageous. Further, it helps in building economical
   software and improving resource planning well in advance. Software
   metrics are strongly correlated with software maintainability as they
   help in examining the structural quality and characteristics of a
   software. Feature subset selection (FSS) is an important data
   preprocessing technique used in data mining. It involves determining a
   subset of notable features for building a prediction model. All software
   metrics are not equally relevant; hence, using all of them for
   predicting maintainability will significantly increase time, budget and
   effort. Thus, to achieve best maintainability prediction results with a
   particular learning algorithm, it is critical to select the most
   relevant features that manifest the characteristics of the software in
   hand which is this study are two open source software Apache Jackrabbit
   and Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL). Our main focus has been to
   reduce the number of metrics using an instance based FSS technique
   Relief and then use these relevant metrics to predict maintainability.
   It was observed that Linear Regression algorithm showed maximum increase
   of approximately 11\% in accuracy levels with Relief FSS algorithm for
   both the open source software datasets. This paper will enable software
   developers to improve design and coding and identify the most relevant
   software metrics that affect software maintainability.},

Title = {Generating design reference years from the UKCP09 projections and their
   application to future air-conditioning loads},

Abstract = {A method is developed to generate future design reference year (DRY)
   data from the United Kingdom Climate Impact Programme's 2009 (UKCP09)
   climate change projections for a variety of future time horizons and
   carbon emission assumptions. The method selects three near-extreme
   summer months and three near-extreme winter months and weaves them into
   an existing test reference year (TRY). Risk levels associated with the
   85th percentile (broadly equivalent to existing Chartered Institution of
   Building Services Engineers {[}CIBSE] design summer years) of the
   cumulative distribution function of dry-bulb temperature and, for
   comparison, the 99th percentile are used. A comparison is made with DRYs
   generated using alternative methods from other research groups. The data
   are applied to future air-conditioning (cooling) loads analysis for a
   wide range of non-domestic case study building types. Simulations using
   a control DRY set applied to these buildings are used to develop a
   simplified regression-based calculation method for predicting future
   air-conditioning loads. The simplified model is shown to be applicable
   to future weather data without loss of accuracy, which makes it possible
   to carry out large numbers of future cooling loads predictions without
   the need to perform extensive and complex energy simulations.
   Practical applications: It is becoming increasingly necessary to design
   energy and comfort services for buildings with a whole-life perspective.
   To assist with this, the CIBSE future weather years can be used for
   building simulations through to the 2080s. In June 2009, the UK's
   Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) with the
   support of the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP)
   published updated climate change projections using a probabilistic
   method. In future, the responsibility will rest with designers to select
   design data from a large number of probabilistic outcomes. This work
   develops a technique to select design weather data called a DRY at two
   alternative risk levels for use in building simulations through to the
   2080s. A simplified method is also proposed to allow practitioners to
   generate large numbers of probabilistic design cooling loads without the
   need to perform extensive simulations.},

Abstract = {There has been a tremendous growth of digital health applications within
   healthcare. Clinicians are inundated with new types of data to
   synthesize in a timely manner to make a clinical decisions about the
   care of their patients. The overwhelming abundance of data leads to
   physician burnout, which is a major problem within healthcare. In
   parallel, there is an immense hype building up about implementation of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Machine Learning or
   Deep Learning, to augment clinician decision making processes.
   Healthcare is a highly regulated environment so it's imperative to
   involve clinicians and data scientists in the entire model development,
   validation and implementation lifecycle. There ought to be a mechanism
   in place for integration of human feedback to build trust in the AI
   model, through human in the loop implementation models and participatory
   design approaches. The overarching aim of this stury is to formulate a
   problem statement and propose the development a system dynamics model
   highlighting the feedback loops within clinical decision-making
   workflows leading to diffusion of innovation of AI within healthcare. We
   propose system dynamics modelling as a mechanism to articulate the
   problems that are best suited for AI models, and conceptualize how the
   models would fit into the current workflow.},

Abstract = {The digital twin (DT) is a virtual replica of real-world buildings,
   processes, structures, people, and systems created and maintained to
   answer questions about its physical part, the physical twin (PT). In the
   case of the built environment, the PT is represented by smart buildings
   and infrastructures. Full synchronization between the DT and the PT will
   allow for a perpetual learning process and updating between the two
   twins. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of DT called
   risk-informed digital twin (RDT). In the DT the model predictions are
   developed through data-driven tools and algorithms. However, multiple
   sources of uncertainty during the lifecycle challenge our understanding
   and ability to effectively model the performance of the modeled systems.
   The RDT's importance lies in its integration of the methods and tools of
   statistics and risk analysis with machine learning. To this aim, the
   platform incorporates a novel framework of data-driven uncertainty
   quantification and risk analysis rooted in information theory. At the
   core of the RDT is a framework of sustainable and resilient based
   engineering (SRBE), introduced in this work and considered the first
   step toward the extension of performance-based engineering (PBE)
   approaches to socioecological-technical systems under uncertainty. A
   risk-informed multicriteria decision support tool able to incorporate
   social aspects is also included, and it can be used for sustainable and
   resilient design in the early stage, or management under uncertainty of
   smart buildings and infrastructure systems. (C) 2022 American Society of

Abstract = {Within the global economy, the built environment makes a major
   contribution to economic activity and has a significant impact on
   sustainability. In addition, the built environment plays a significant
   social role as it influences where we live along with how we work,
   entertain, and learn. Even though the built environment plays such a
   significant social and economic role, it has been slow in adopting
   emerging technologies to make the way we design, build, utilize, and
   decommission more efficient while having less of a negative impact on
   the environment. This paper explores how we can integrate data science
   and Cyber Physical Systems into the built environment to achieve greater
   efficiencies. This paper introduces some of the industry challenges
   along with an overview of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper
   includes qualitative interview data that is driving the development of a
   working model that integrates emerging technologies to achieve budget,

Title = {Public policy and technology choices for municipal solid waste
   management a recent case in Lebanon},
Journal = {COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a natural accrual in various communities
   resulting from daily activities, which offers challenges and
   opportunities. Developed countries lean towards ``upstream avoidance{''}
   type of solutions, while less developed countries use ``downstream
   remediation{''} solutions. In between these two options, many hybrid
   solutions involve triage and final disposal of post-treated reduced MSW
   mass.
   The aim of the present article is to briefly review the evolution of
   policies related to MSW, to address an illustrative case of a recent
   crisis in Lebanon, and to present the development of a multivariate
   analysis model on public attitudes towards MSW management. It explores
   incineration with air pollution control and energy recovery.
   Non-incineration solutions, including anaerobic digestion, may be more
   appealing provided the full process, its byproducts and risks, are
   better understood. Furthermore, the latter solution requires a higher
   level of investment, expertise, agement weaknesses in less developed
   countries.
   A multivariate linear regression analysis model is developed and
   presented to describe public attitudes regarding MSW management. Linear
   regression was used to model a direct relationship between a response
   variable and several explanatory variables. A simplifying assumption is
   made to test the attractiveness of incineration with energy recovery
   (IER) including a process for air pollution control. In the multivariate
   analysis, the dependent variable is a composite index that describes the
   extent to which respondents agree with a potential IER solution. The
   independent variables include (1) the extent of public
   awareness-building about upstream triage, (2) privatization, (3) quality
   management in daily operations, (4) challenges in implementation and (5)
   reliability of public management authorities. The multivariate analysis
   showed that there is a statistically significant and positive
   correlation with a requisite quality in daily operations, and in
   technological upfront investment. It showed a statistically significant
   and negative correlation with the reliability of public management and
   privatization. As for public awareness about upstream household level
   triage, there was no statistically significant correlation. This last
   result seems counter-intuitive, but it may be due to the fact that
   respondents have low expectations about the impact of their actions on
   government decisions. The general public, faced with socio-economic
   problems, may not see household triage as a determining factor. Public
   perception is that triage ends up with a MSW collection and transport
   with a mixed dumping at final destination.
   The analysis shows that prevention is preferred to remediation and that
   it requires supporting public policies to make it practical, especially
   in less developed countries. Bio-processes are well-accepted and may
   become part of the local practice once their long-term effects become
   better understood to mitigate potential risks. The IER option is
   perceived as technologically and financially viable and that clear
   public policies should be designed and implemented.},

Title = {A critical review of digital value engineering in building design
   towards automated construction},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Value engineering (VE) has the potential to increase sustainability in
   buildings by optimizing function-to-cost ratios. However, outdated
   manual procedures limit integration and consistency in construction
   projects, necessitating the evaluation of VE automation. This review
   examines VE automation in building design and construction. A systematic
   analysis of 664 publications from major databases was conducted,
   yielding 136 relevant articles. Bibliometric analysis using descriptive
   statistics and keyword mapping identified key VE methodologies and
   building types. Key technologies in VE automation include BIM, advanced
   algorithms, and data integration. These tools enable automated layout
   generation, material selection, and technical configurations, enhancing
   value optimization. BIM serves as a central data platform, improving
   stakeholder collaboration. Algorithms rapidly generate design
   alternatives, optimizing decision-making. Data integration ensures
   accuracy across project stages. Challenges include incomplete databases,
   lifecycle integration issues, and resistance to change. A continuous
   digital VE framework is proposed to address these barriers. This
   framework emphasizes the seamless integration of VE tools with BIM
   platforms, enhancing interoperability and user engagement. In the
   future, there will be further opportunities to advance VE automation
   through the creation of more advanced predictive analytics algorithms,
   more real-time data processing capabilities, and increased
   interoperability amongst various digital tools. The integration of
   machine learning and artificial intelligence into VE processes is also
   suggested to further enhance optimization and efficiency in construction
   projects.},

Title = {The combined effect of customer perceptions about a salesperson's
   adaptive selling and selling orientation on customer trust in the
   salesperson: a contingency perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS \& INDUSTRIAL MARKETING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-564},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of customer perceptions
   about a salesperson's combined use of adaptive selling (AS) and selling
   orientation (SO) on customer trust in the salesperson. Based on insights
   from attribution theory, the contingency model of salespeople'
   effectiveness, relationship marketing and market orientation
   literatures, the authors analyze the interplay between customer
   perceptions of salespeople's AS and SO, and how this affects customer
   trust. Furthermore, adopting a contingency perspective, the authors
   investigate how two important situational variables (i.e. length of
   buyer-seller relationships and importance of purchase for the buyer)
   affect this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on regression analysis
   with two-and three-way interactions, using survey data from 134
   business-to-business (B2B) buyers.
   Findings - The results indicate that the interplay between AS and SO is
   negatively related to trust, and that the above situation is attenuated
   in sales contexts characterized by high purchase importance or enduring
   buyer-seller relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - The empirical findings are based on
   firms from a single industry. Second, a cross-sectional research design
   is adopted. Third, the absence of measures of objective performance
   (e.g. sales) might be regarded as a limitation.
   Practical implications - The study suggests that salespeople willing to
   win customer trust should modify their approach across the relationship
   life cycle. Similarly, when purchase importance for the customer is low,
   salespeople interested in building relationships based on trust should
   combine AS and customer orientation. In contrast, when purchase
   importance is high, salespeople can only generate more trust by
   increasing customer orientation/reducing SO. These findings might
   inspire sales trainers and sales managers in developing training
   experiences based on adaptation and customer orientation.
   Originality/value - The research contributes in several ways to the
   literature. First, the simultaneous effect of AS and SO on performance
   (i.e. customer trust) was investigated. Second, the analysis of the
   interaction between AS and SO was complemented by testing two important
   boundary conditions residing in the selling situation: purchase
   importance and relationship length. Third, this study is the first to
   examine the interplay among AS, SO and selling context outside using
   customer data from actual B2B sales interactions. Also, it enhances
   knowledge of the effects of AS on sales outcomes by adding a long-term,
   relational outcome (i.e. trust) to previous work that tended to focus on
   short-term outcomes (i.e. sales revenues). Furthermore, by investigating
   perceived benefits from the point of view of customers rather than
   sellers, our findings add to previous studies of AS which relied too
   heavily, or exclusively, on the voice of the seller. Finally, this study
   shed further light on the role played by SO in affecting customer-based
   performance.},

Title = {Smart Buildings: Water Leakage Detection Using TinyML},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The escalating global water usage and the increasing strain on major
   cities due to water shortages highlights the critical need for efficient
   water management practices. In water-stressed regions worldwide,
   significant water wastage is primarily attributed to leakages,
   inefficient use, and aging infrastructure. Undetected water leakages in
   buildings' pipelines contribute to the water waste problem. To address
   this issue, an effective water leak detection method is required. In
   this paper, we explore the application of edge computing in smart
   buildings to enhance water management. By integrating sensors and
   embedded Machine Learning models, known as TinyML, smart water
   management systems can collect real-time data, analyze it, and make
   accurate decisions for efficient water utilization. The transition to
   TinyML enables faster and more cost-effective local decision-making,
   reducing the dependence on centralized entities. In this work, we
   propose a solution that can be adapted for effective leakage detection
   in real-world scenarios with minimum human intervention using TinyML. We
   follow an approach that is similar to a typical machine learning
   lifecycle in production, spanning stages including data collection,
   training, hyperparameter tuning, offline evaluation and model
   optimization for on-device resource efficiency before deployment. In
   this work, we considered an existing water leakage acoustic dataset for
   polyvinyl chloride pipelines. To prepare the acoustic data for analysis,
   we performed preprocessing to transform it into scalograms. We devised a
   water leak detection method by applying transfer learning to five
   distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variants, which are namely
   EfficientNet, ResNet, AlexNet, MobileNet V1, and MobileNet V2. The CNN
   models were found to be able to detect leakages where a maximum testing
   accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 97.45\%, 98.57\%, 96.70\%,
   and 97.63\%, respectively, were observed using the EfficientNet model.
   To enable seamless deployment on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE edge device,
   the EfficientNet model is compressed using quantization resulting in a
   low inference time of 1932 ms, a peak RAM usage of 255.3 kilobytes, and
   a flash usage requirement of merely 48.7 kilobytes.},

Title = {Combining molecular dynamics simulations and scoring method to
   computationally model ubiquitylated linker histones in chromatosomes},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Author summaryIn eukaryotic cells the linker histones play a crucial
   role in the formation of higher order nucleoprotein complex of DNA,
   especially for the arrangement of the nucleosomes. Histones can undergo
   several modifications, but modification of a linker histone with a
   single ubiquitin (mono-ubiquitylation) remains one of the least
   understood epigenetic modifications. One reason is the inaccessibility
   of homogeneously modified linker histones for experimental methods,
   which are crucial for distinct studies. We combine molecular dynamics
   simulations with machine learning-based approaches to study the
   influence of mono-ubiquitylation in linker histones on DNA interaction
   and their ability to form higher order chromatin structures. We were
   able to determine the probable states in six differently linked
   histone-ubiquitin complexes via accelerating classical molecular
   dynamics simulations and using advanced state characterization
   techniques. While it is possible to access the chromatosome with
   ubiquitylated linker histone computationally, even faster sampling
   techniques like coarse-graining and Brownian dynamics can greatly
   benefit from an ensemble of atomistic structures. We developed an
   efficient geometric scoring technique to select biologically relevant
   structures of all six mono-ubiquitylated linker histone that can bind to
   nucleosome and present them as atomistic starting structures for further
   studies.
   The chromatin in eukaryotic cells plays a fundamental role in all
   processes during a cell's life cycle. This nucleoprotein is normally
   tightly packed but needs to be unpacked for expression and division. The
   linker histones are critical for such packaging processes and while most
   experimental and simulation works recognize their crucial importance,
   the focus is nearly always set on the nucleosome as the basic chromatin
   building block. Linker histones can undergo several modifications, but
   only few studies on their ubiquitylation have been conducted.
   Mono-ubiquitylated linker histones (HUb), while poorly understood, are
   expected to influence DNA compaction. The size of ubiquitin and the
   globular domain of the linker histone are comparable and one would
   expect an increased disorder upon ubiquitylation of the linker histone.
   However, the formation of higher order chromatin is not hindered and
   ubiquitylation of the linker histone may even promote gene expression.
   Structural data on chromatosomes is rare and HUb has never been modeled
   in a chromatosome so far. Descriptions of the chromatin complex with HUb
   would greatly benefit from computational structural data. In this study
   we generate molecular dynamics simulation data for six differently
   linked HUb variants with the help of a sampling scheme tailored to drive
   the exploration of phase space. We identify conformational sub-states of
   the six HUb variants using the sketch-map algorithm for dimensionality
   reduction and iterative HDBSCAN for clustering on the excessively
   sampled, shallow free energy landscapes. We present a highly efficient
   geometric scoring method to identify sub-states of HUb that fit into the
   nucleosome. We predict HUb conformations inside a nucleosome using
   on-dyad and off-dyad chromatosome structures as reference and show that
   unbiased simulations of HUb produce significantly more fitting than
   non-fitting HUb conformations. A tetranucleosome array is used to show
   that ubiquitylation can even occur in chromatin without too much steric
   clashes.},

Title = {Big Data and Its Applications in Smart Real Estate and the Disaster
   Management Life Cycle: A Systematic Analysis},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated
   daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and
   internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of
   better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a
   challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as
   the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be
   tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing
   and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data
   in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic
   analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data
   and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a
   recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to
   top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search
   engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed
   down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were
   conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis,
   keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors' names,
   countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field
   of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data
   lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and
   research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with
   interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management,
   data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further
   show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the
   seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value,
   visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods
   for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions
   were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to
   ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient.
   The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage,
   retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data,
   which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and
   encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure
   Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation,
   building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks,
   checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State
   Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of
   frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including
   Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture
   the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful,
   swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in
   two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and
   disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for
   field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas
   through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big
   data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to
   poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate
   to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization
   that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the
   customers by the sellers and real estate managers.
   Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media,
   drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural
   disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan
   emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real
   estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from
   the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities
   management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with
   the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help
   prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.},

   study},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) experiment management tools support ML
   practitioners and software engineers when building intelligent software
   systems. By managing large numbers of ML experiments comprising many
   different ML assets, they not only facilitate engineering ML models and
   ML-enabled systems, but also managing their evolution-for instance,
   tracing system behavior to concrete experiments when the model
   performance drifts. However, while ML experiment management tools have
   become increasingly popular, little is known about their effectiveness
   in practice, as well as their actual benefits and challenges. We present
   a mixed-methods empirical study of experiment management tools and the
   support they provide to users. First, our survey of 81 ML practitioners
   sought to determine the benefits and challenges of ML experiment
   management and of the existing tool landscape. Second, a controlled
   experiment with 15 student developers investigated the effectiveness of
   ML experiment management tools. We learned that 70\% of our survey
   respondents perform ML experiments using specialized tools, while out of
   those who do not use such tools, 52\% are unaware of experiment
   management tools or of their benefits. The controlled experiment showed
   that experiment management tools offer valuable support to users to
   systematically track and retrieve ML assets. Using ML experiment
   management tools reduced error rates and increased completion rates. By
   presenting a user's perspective on experiment management tools, and the
   first controlled experiment in this area, we hope that our results
   foster the adoption of these tools in practice, as well as they direct
   tool builders and researchers to improve the tool landscape overall.},

Abstract = {The evolving nature of contemporary careers has sparked an interest in
   the sustainability of individual careers, which encompasses the pursuit
   of careers in a manner that promotes health, productivity, and overall
   happiness. Although previous studies have provided valuable perspectives
   on sustainable careers, there remains a notable lack of evidence
   regarding the interplay between individual and contextual determinants
   in crafting sustainable careers. Therefore, integrating the framework of
   sustainable careers with the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory,
   this study proposes a serial indirect effect mechanism that examines the
   relationship between contextual determinants (i.e., work/family demands
   and resources) and career sustainability indicators (i.e., work-family
   balance, employability, work engagement, and work strain) sequentially
   through career crafting and person-career fit. A two-wave time-lagged
   survey was conducted with 412 employees from Turkey. Hierarchical
   regression analyses were performed to test the proposed model, while
   Process Macro analyses were conducted to examine the serial indirect
   effects. Results showed that contextual demands and resources were
   positively associated with career crafting and such career initiatives
   were related to optimized person-career fit and career sustainability
   indicators. Notably, contextual determinants were indirectly related to
   employability and work engagement serially via career crafting and
   person-career fit. Highlighting the importance of a whole-life
   perspective in career development, which involves work and family
   contexts, this study reveals the integral role of career proactivity and
   its interplay with contextual determinants in building sustainable
   careers.},

Abstract = {Digital twins are becoming a business imperative, covering the entire
   lifecycle of an asset, and forming the foundation for connected products
   and services. Companies that fail to respond will be left behind.
   Implementing a dynamic cloud model of a physical thing or system such as
   wind turbine that relies on live streaming data will help to understand
   its states, respond to changes, improve operations, and add value to its
   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as reliability, availability,
   maintenance cost and associated risks. This paper contributes to build a
   power prediction digital twin for a wind turbine's generic model guided
   by IEC 61400-25, IEC 61400-27-1-2020 (Type 4A) via utilizing the data
   analytics of Microsoft (R) Azure IoT mechanisms along with decentralized
   decisions of Machine Learning (ML) in such way utilizing its strengths
   in physics-based, data-driven modeling and the hybrid analysis
   approaches. The proposed modeling technique can help the scientific
   community in building long-term maintenance models for wind farms
   considering maintenance opportunities and condition prediction, as well
   as evaluating the machine performance including maintenance costs and
   production losses.},

Title = {Nexus between running costs and building characteristics of commercial
   buildings: hedonic regression modelling},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-406},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Purpose Traditionally, early-stage investment decisions on buildings
   purely based initial capital costs and simply ignored running costs and
   total lifecycle cost. This was basically due to the absence of
   estimating models that yield running costs at the early design stage.
   Often, when the design of a building, which is responsible for 10-15\%
   of its total cost, is completed, 80\% of the total cost is committed.
   This study aims to develop a building characteristic-based model, which
   is an early-stage determinant of running costs of buildings, to predict
   the running costs of commercial buildings. Design/methodology/approach A
   desk study was carried out to collect running costs data and building
   characteristics of 35 commercial buildings in Sri Lanka. A Pareto
   analysis, bivariate correlation analysis and hedonic regression
   modelling were performed on collected data. Findings According to Pareto
   analysis, utilities, services, admin work and cleaning are four main
   cost constituents, responsible for 80\% of running costs, which can be
   represented by highly correlated building characteristics of building
   height, number of floors and size. Approximately 94\% of the variance in
   annual running costs/sq. m is expressed by variables of number of
   floors, net floor area and working hours/day together with a mean
   prediction accuracy of 2.89\%. Research limitations/implications The
   study has utilised a sample of 35 commercial buildings due to
   non-availability and difficulty in accessing running cost data.
   Originality/value Early-stage supportive running costs estimation model
   proposed by the study would enable construction professionals to
   benchmark the running costs and thereby optimise the building design.
   The developed hedonic model illustrated the variance of running costs
   concerning the changes in characteristics of a building.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The digital twin (DT) is recognized as a promising technology for
   achieving enhanced monitoring, control, and prediction of physical
   systems, contributing to increased reliability and effectiveness. While
   most researchers have concentrated on developing DTs for shop-floor and
   machine tools, there has been limited attention given to human
   operators. Only a few researchers have recognized that building a human
   DT is critical to achieving human-centric production. we propose a
   hybrid modeling approach that combines a mechanism model and a time
   -series forecasting model. This comprehensive full-lifecycle worker DT
   model is designed for production activities. Subsequently, we employ a
   discrete-event simulation model to amalgamate the worker DT with an
   industrial robot DT. The modular and multi -level modeling methodology
   is employed to enhance the efficiency of system reconstruction. Finally,
   we illustrate the modeling process and functions using a washing machine
   assembly line as an example. The presented model facilitates the
   creation of new workers' training plans, demonstrating the practical
   application of the proposed method. This novel approach to modeling
   workers' DT in manufacturing not only supports the development of a more
   accurate DT production system but also offers versatility for
   application in various contexts.},

Abstract = {With the development of IoT, virtual reality, cloud computing, and
   digital twin technologies, the advent of metaverse has attracted
   increasing world attention. Metaverse integrates and applies multiple
   emerging technologies to cloud education, smart health, digital
   government, and emergency evacuation. Evacuation systems are of great
   importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may
   not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to
   leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a
   branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model
   an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd
   distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a
   path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through
   dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this
   article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency
   evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system
   built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most
   efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The
   information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and
   smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building
   in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers
   in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees.
   Experiments in different simulation scenes demonstrate that the proposed
   method is superior to the traditional static guidance method in saving
   evacuation time. It can effectively avoid major crowding along the
   evacuation route and improve evacuation efficiency.},

Abstract = {It is a very popular era for machine learning (ML) applications, and
   Industry5.0 aims to have AI as one of its key technologies. Still, only
   a few ML initiatives make it to a production-grade implementation,
   mostly due to lacking proper Continuous Integration and Delivery
   framework and MLOps practices. This is especially true for industrial
   use cases, where the trust and reliability of ML applications are
   mission-critical. Most of these applications fail during the final stage
   of the development lifecycle, i.e. acceptance testing and validation of
   the ML application, while being integrated into Cyber-Physical System of
   Systems (CPSoS). This paper explores the key requirements for deploying
   ML applications in industrial scenarios, emphasizing the critical role
   of Digital Twins, edge AI, and responsible-explainable AI techniques in
   ensuring efficient and responsible operations. Building upon previous
   models, this paper suggests two process models: (i) the Olympics model
   for MLOps-coupled CPS engineering and (ii) the MLOps engineering
   toolchain for industrial applications.},

Title = {BIM and real estate valuation: challenges, potentials and lessons for
   future directions},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is a striking development
   in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, which
   provides in-depth information on different stages of the building
   lifecycle. Real estate valuation, as a fully interconnected field with
   the AEC industry, can benefit from 3D technical achievements in BIM
   technologies. Some studies have attempted to use BIM for real estate
   valuation procedures. However, there is still a limited understanding of
   appropriate mechanisms to utilize BIM for valuation purposes and the
   consequent impact that BIM can have on decreasing the existing
   uncertainties in the valuation methods. Therefore, the paper aims to
   analyze the literature on BIM for real estate valuation practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a systematic review to
   analyze existing utilizations of BIM for real estate valuation
   practices, discovers the challenges, limitations and gaps of the current
   applications and presents potential domains for future investigations.
   Research was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar
   databases to find relevant references that could contribute to the
   study. A total of 52 publications including journal papers, conference
   papers and proceedings, book chapters and PhD and master's theses were
   identified and thoroughly reviewed. There was no limitation on the
   starting date of research, but the end date was May 2022. Findings -
   Four domains of application have been identified: (1) developing machine
   learning-based valuation models using the variables that could directly
   be captured through BIM and industry foundation classes (IFC) data
   instances of building objects and their attributes; (2) evaluating the
   capacity of 3D factors extractable from BIM and 3D GIS in increasing the
   accuracy of existing valuation models; (3) employing BIM for accurate
   estimation of components of cost approach-based valuation practices; and
   (4) extraction of useful visual features for real estate valuation from
   BIM representations instead of 2D images through deep learning and
   computer vision. Originality/value - This paper contributes to research
   efforts on utilization of 3D modeling in real estate valuation
   practices. In this regard, this paper presents a broad overview of the
   current applications of BIM for valuation procedures and provides
   potential ways forward for future investigations.},

Abstract = {Humans are a highly social species. Complex interactions for mutual
   support range from helping neighbors to building social welfare
   institutions. During times of distress or crisis, sharing life
   experiences within one's social circle is critical for well-being. By
   translating pattern-learning algorithms to the UK Biobank
   imaging-genetics cohort (n = similar to 40000 participants), we have
   delineated manifestations of regular social support in multimodal
   whole-brain measurements. In structural brain variation, we identified
   characteristic volumetric signatures in the salience and limbic networks
   for high- versus low-social support individuals. In patterns derived
   from functional coupling, we also located interindividual differences in
   social support in action-perception circuits related to binding sensory
   cues and initiating behavioral responses. In line with our demographic
   profiling analysis, the uncovered neural substrates have potential
   implications for loneliness, substance misuse, and resilience to stress.},

Abstract = {The 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence provided extensive evidence
   of the significant seismic vulnerability of New Zealand unreinforced
   masonry (URM) churches. Given the high seismicity of the country, the
   exposure of human lives and the societal significance of ecclesiastic
   buildings, for both historical and religious reasons, the reduction in
   seismic vulnerability of this building type is of primary importance. By
   analyzing the seismic performance of a sample of 80 affected buildings,
   regression models correlating mean damage levels against ground-motion
   parameters were developed for observed collapse mechanisms, accounting
   for vulnerability modifiers whose influence was estimated via
   statistical procedures. Considering the homogeneity of New Zealand URM
   churches, the vulnerability models developed for the Canterbury region
   were extended to the whole country inventory, and a synthetic index was
   proposed to summarise damage related to several mechanisms. Territorial
   scale assessment of the seismic vulnerability of churches can assist
   emergency management efforts and facilitate the identification of
   priorities for more in-depth analysis of individual buildings. After
   proper calibration, the proposed approach can be applied to other
   countries with similar building heritage.},

Title = {Multi-objective integrated optimization of geothermal heating system
   with energy storage using digital twin technology},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {252},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Heat energy storage technology plays a significant role in energy
   systems, and the various technological solutions brought about by
   digitalization are especially valuable in the field of energy storage.
   This article proposes an innovative model based on digital twin
   technology to solve the supply-demand mismatch problem in geothermal
   heating systems. This model achieves multi-objective optimization of
   comprehensive cost, geothermal energy utilization rate, and carbon
   emission by constructing a heat storage geothermal heating system.
   Digital twin technology integrates data and information models of public
   buildings and facilitates their sharing and transmission throughout the
   entire lifecycle of the geothermal heating system. Initially, the
   proposed method employs a machine learning-based approach to accurately
   predict heating demand. Subsequently, the operation of the heat storage
   water tank and heat pump units is optimized to resolve difficulties in
   matching energy supply and demand. Finally, the method takes full
   advantage of time-of-use electricity pricing policies to reduce costs.
   The data utilized were collected from an office building in China over a
   period of six months. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) In
   terms of predicting heating demand, the improved neural network proposed
   in this study achieved a prediction accuracy of 98\%, which is a 10\%
   improvement over comparative algorithms. Additionally, the experimental
   comparison of four types of errors showed that the machine learning
   method proposed had smaller errors across the board. (2) The method
   realized collaborative multi-objective optimization, and in five
   scenarios, the comprehensive performance index increased by up to
   38.03\% compared to the benchmark system. This indicates that
   intelligent technology is an effective means of enhancing the energy
   sustainability of geothermal heating systems, and the use of geothermal
   energy as a clean energy source effectively addresses issues related to
   the storage, utilization, management, and energy conservation of
   buildings.},

Abstract = {The power of artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with optimization
   algorithms can be linked to data-rich digital twin models to perform
   predictive analysis to make better informed decisions about installation
   operations and quality of life for the warfighters. In the current
   research, we developed AI connected lifecycle building information
   models through the creation of a data informed smart digital twin of one
   of US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) buildings as our test case.
   Digital twin (DT) technology involves creating a virtual representation
   of a physical entity. Digital twin is created by digitalizing data
   collected through sensors, powered by machine learning (ML) algorithms,
   and are continuously learning systems. The exponential advance in
   digital technologies enables facility spaces to be fully and richly
   modeled in three dimensions and can be brought together in virtual
   space. Coupled with advancement in reinforcement learning and computer
   graphics enables AI agents to learn visual navigation and interaction
   with objects. We have used Habitat AI 2.0 to train an embodied agent in
   immersive 3D photorealistic environment. The embodied agent interacts
   with a 3D environment by receiving RGB, depth and semantically segmented
   views of the environment and taking navigational actions and interacts
   with the objects in the 3D space. Instead of training the robots in
   physical world we are training embodied agents in simulated 3D space.
   While humans are superior at critical thinking, creativity, and managing
   people, whereas robots are superior at coping with harsh environments
   and performing highly repetitive work. Training robots in controlled
   simulated world is faster and can increase their surveillance,
   reliability, efficiency, and survivability in physical space.},

Abstract = {This study measured the lifecycle carbon emissions of buildings in 30
   Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2020 and decomposed the drivers of carbon
   emissions in the materialization stage and operation stage of building,
   respectively, using the Stochastic Impacts with the Regression on
   Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model in order to
   investigate the drivers of carbon emissions and their spatial influence
   effects in the building sector. The spatial Durbin model (SDM) was used
   to thoroughly investigate the spatial effects of carbon emissions and
   their drivers in the building sector under geographic and economic
   distances. According to the findings, China's building sector has a high
   concentration of carbon emissions in the east and a low concentration in
   the west. There is also a sizable spatial autocorrelation, and the
   spatial spillover effects in the materialization and operation stages
   shift in opposite directions. To help the building sector to achieve the
   carbon peaking and neutrality goals, specific policy recommendations are
   made based on the study's findings.},

Abstract = {Multifunctional composites provide more than one function from the same
   part. The anisotropy, material, and process characterization challenges
   and the lack of standardization on the 3D-printed multifunctional carbon
   composites make it difficult for application into aerospace. The current
   solutions for additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and additively
   manufactured monofunctional and multifunctional composites are not
   mature enough for safety-critical applications. A new approach is
   proposed to explore the use of machine learning (ML) in the design,
   development, AM, testing, and certification of multifunctional
   composites for aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and
   spacecraft. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN)
   architecture is proposed. An AM-embedded building block approach
   integrates the complete lifecycle of aircraft, UAS, and spacecraft using
   ANN to support the continued operational safety (COS) of aircraft,
   spacecraft, and UAS. The proposed method exploits the power of ANN on
   the metadata for the characterization of multifunctional material
   properties and processes and the mapping of the failure modes compared
   with the predicted models and history. This paper provides an in-depth
   analysis and explanation of the new methods needed to overcome the
   existing barriers, problems, and situations.},

Title = {Butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin:: the
   role of natural and human-induced factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim We developed a model enabling us to evaluate the contribution of
   both natural and human-related factors to butterfly species richness in
   Catalonia, a Mediterranean area that harbours one of the most diverse
   butterfly faunas in Europe.
   Location The study was carried out in Catalonia (north-east Iberian
   Peninsula), a region of 31,930 km(2) lying between the Pyrenees, the
   Ebro depression and the Mediterranean sea.
   Methods Data from the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme were used to
   assess butterfly species richness from 55 transects spread all over the
   region. Three groups of environmental variables likely to affect the
   presence of butterfly species were calculated, above all from geographic
   information system data: (1) climatology and topography, (2) vegetation
   structure and (3) human disturbance. Because climatic and topographic
   variables are expected to be strongly correlated, we first performed a
   principal component analysis (PCA) to create a summarizing factor that
   would account for most of the variance within this set of variables.
   Subsequently, a backward stepwise multiple regression was performed in
   order to assess the effects of environmental factors on butterfly
   species richness.
   Results A total of 131 species were detected in the monitoring
   transects, representing 75.7\% of the butterfly fauna known from
   Catalonia. Mean species richness per transect and per year was 41.4,
   although values varied greatly among sites (range: 14-76.8). The final
   regression model explained more than 80\% of the total variance, which
   indicated a strong association between butterfly species richness and
   the studied environmental factors. The model revealed the very important
   contribution of climatic and topographic variables, which were combined
   into a single factor in the PCA. In contrast to what has been found in
   other, more northerly countries, species richness was negatively
   correlated with temperature and positively correlated with rainfall,
   except for extreme cold and wet conditions. This may be a consequence of
   the predictably adverse effects of the Mediterranean summer drought on
   herbivorous insects, and the fact that the limits of distribution of
   many butterflies correlate well with climatic variables. Human
   disturbance (defined as the proportion of urban and agricultural
   landscape cover in buffer areas of 5 km around the transect sites) was
   the second most important predictor for species richness. We found that
   a significant decrease in species numbers was associated with an
   increase in human pressure, a finding that indicates that not only
   building development, but also modern-day agricultural practices are
   detrimental to the conservation of Mediterranean butterflies.
   Surprisingly, vegetation variables had an almost negligible effect on
   butterfly species richness.
   Main conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the current motors
   of global change will have a negative effect on Mediterranean butterfly
   assemblages. First, changes in land-use are transforming and fragmenting
   the landscape into an inhospitable and less permeable matrix for
   butterflies. Secondly, the negative correlation between species richness
   and temperature will lead to a predictable loss of diversity over the
   coming years, as predicted in the most plausible scenarios of climate
   change. Considering the high butterfly richness characterizing the
   Mediterranean Basin, this future trend will pose a serious threat to
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Devices as a Use Case for Postmarketing
   Surveillance of Medical Devices},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is building a
   national postmarketing surveillance system for medical devices, moving
   to a ``total product life cycle{''} approach whereby more limited
   premarketing data are balanced with postmarketing surveillance to
   capture rare adverse events and long-term safety issues. OBJECTIVE To
   assess the methodological requirements and feasibility of postmarketing
   device surveillance using endovascular aneurysm repair devices (EVARs),
   which have been the subject of safety concerns, using clinical data from
   a large health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This
   retrospective cohort study included patients with electronic health
   record (EHR) data in the Veterans Affairs Corporate DataWarehouse.
   EXPOSURE Implantation of an AFX Endovascular AAA System (AFX) device
   (any of 3 iterations) or a non-AFX comparator EVAR device from January
   1, 2011, to December 21, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary
   outcomeswere rates of type III endoleaks and all-cause mortality; and
   rates of these outcomes associated with AFX devices compared with
   non-AFX devices, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression
   models and doubly robust causal modeling. Information on type III
   endoleaks was available only as free-text mentions in clinical notes,
   while all-cause mortality data could be extracted using structured data.
   Device-specific information required by the FDA is ascertained using
   unique device identifiers (UDIs), which include factors such as model
   numbers, catalog numbers, and manufacturer-specific product codes. The
   availability of UDIs in EHRs was assessed. RESULTS In total, 13 941
   patients (mean {[}SD] age, 71.8 {[}7.4] years) received 1 of the devices
   of interest (AFX with Strata {[}AFX-S]: 718 patients {[}5.2\%]; AFX with
   Duraply {[}AFX-D]: 404 patients {[}2.9\%]; or AFX2: 682 patients
   {[}4.9\%]), and 12 137 (87.1\%) received non-AFX devices. The UDIs were
   not recorded in the EHR for any patient with an AFX device, and partial
   UDIs were available for 19 patients (0.1\%) with a non-AFX device. This
   necessitated the development of advanced natural language processing
   tools to define the cohort of patients for analysis. The study
   identified a significantly higher risk of type III endoleaks at 5 years
   among patients receiving any of the AFX device iterations, including the
   most recent version, AFX2 (11.6\%; 95\% CI, 8.1\%-15.1\%) compared with
   that among patients with non-AFX devices (5.7\%; 95\% CI, 2.2\%-9.2\%;
   absolute risk difference, 5.9\%; 95\% CI, 2.3\%-9.4\%). However, there
   was no significantly higher all-cause mortality for any of the AFX
   device iterations, including for AFX2 (19.0\%; 95\% CI, 16.0\%-22.0\%)
   compared with non-AFX devices (18.0\%; 95\% CI, 15.0\%-21.0\%; absolute
   risk difference, 1.0\%; 95\% CI, -2.1\% to 4.1\%). CONCLUSIONS AND
   RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that clinical data
   can be used for the postmarketing device surveillance required by the
   FDA. The study also highlights ongoing challenges to performing
   larger-scale surveillance, including lack of consistent use of UDIs and
   insufficient relevant structured data to efficiently capture certain
   outcomes of interest.},

Abstract = {Below is an account of a teaching experience, in which the use of 3D
   modeling, digital and physical, has heightened the desire of students to
   increase their knowledge of the old-town center of the Municipality of
   Castelmarte. The ultimate goal of the survey was to make a physical
   model of part of the territory which included the old mountain
   settlement, with the most significant social-life buildings: the town
   hall, the parish complex, the sports field, the small town park.
   To achieve this, it was necessary to use different survey methods,
   supplementing direct survey with the use of the digital survey
   instruments used in topography. The graphic rendering of the survey was
   developed by integrating various types of 3D modeling software which,
   through subsequent steps, led to the creation of a physical model,
   developed at the Prototyping Laboratory of the Milan Polytechnic, of the
   whole of the old-town center.
   The following images document the various work stages and the different
   survey and representation methods used. These clearly show the process
   of gradual advancement of knowledge developed during the physical
   modeling stage, regarding the morphology of the hilly terrain, the shape
   and mutual position of the buildings, the different slopes of the
   pitched roofs.
   The digital modeling method used to create the physical model requires
   extreme precision in the realization of the design and was therefore the
   stimulus to perform a detailed survey of the existing situation; at the
   same time, it provided the opportunity to learn to use and compare
   different types of software. Learning was verified directly through the
   tangible result of the physical model, built on the basis of the 3D
   model, using a rapid prototyping machine.},

Abstract = {Participants in online communities often enact different roles when
   participating in their communities. For example, some in cancer support
   communities specialize in providing disease-related information or
   socializing new members. This work clusters the behavioral patterns of
   users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles.
   Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, this
   research identified eleven roles that members occupy, such as welcomer
   and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics, including how roles
   change over members' lifecycles, and how roles predict long-term
   participation in the community. We found that members frequently change
   roles over their history, from ones that seek resources to ones offering
   help, while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's
   history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued
   participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for
   facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of
   community-building efforts.},

Title = {Parametric embodied carbon prediction model for early stage estimating},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {106-119},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The focus of carbon management is shifting from operational carbon to
   embodied carbon as a result of the improved operational energy
   efficiency of buildings. Measuring and managing embodied carbon right
   from the early stages of projects will unlock a range of opportunities
   to achieve the highest possible emissions reduction which could not be
   achieved otherwise during the latter stages. However, measuring embodied
   carbon during the early stages of design is challenging and highly
   uncertain due to the unavailability of detailed design information.
   Therefore, the research presented in this paper addresses this problem
   in a structured and an objective way. A parametric embodied carbon
   prediction model was developed using regression analysis to estimate
   embodied carbon when only minimal design information is available and
   with less uncertainty. The model was developed by collecting historical
   data of office buildings in the UK from four different data sources and
   estimating embodied carbon by combining several estimating techniques.
   Wall to floor ratio and the number of basements were identified as the
   model predictors with a model fit of 48.1\% (R-2). A five-fold
   cross-validation ensured that the model predicts within the acceptable
   accuracy range for new data. The developed model had an accuracy of +/-
   89.35\% which is within the acceptable accuracy range for an early stage
   prediction model. In addition, the need for standardising embodied
   carbon measurements and to develop embodied carbon benchmarks to
   facilitate embodied carbon estimating throughout the project lifecycle
   were emphasised. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Early identification of a polyp in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract
   can lead to prevention of life-threatening colorectal cancer. Developing
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to detect polyps can improve
   detection accuracy and efficiency and save the time of the domain
   experts called endoscopists. Lack of annotated data is a common
   challenge when building CAD systems. Generating synthetic medical data
   is an active research area to overcome the problem of having relatively
   few true positive cases in the medical domain. To be able to efficiently
   train machine learning (ML) models, which are the core of CAD systems, a
   considerable amount of data should be used. In this respect, we propose
   the PolypConnect pipeline, which can convert non-polyp images into polyp
   images to increase the size of training datasets for training. We
   present the whole pipeline with quantitative and qualitative evaluations
   involving endoscopists. The polyp segmentation model trained using
   synthetic data, and real data shows a 5.1\% improvement of mean
   intersection over union (mIOU), compared to the model trained only using
   real data. The codes of all the experiments are available on GitHub to
   reproduce the results.},

Title = {Exploring the spatio-temporal driving mechanism of multi-dimensional
   urbanization on urban residential buildings based on GTWR: a case study
   of China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 30},
Abstract = {Examining how urbanization affects carbon emissions in the construction
   industry is crucial for China's efforts to achieve environmentally
   friendly and low-carbon growth. Nevertheless, current research
   predominantly employs a unidimensional approach to gauge urbanization,
   overlooking the nuanced characteristics of novel urbanization. This
   study explored the spatial and temporal characteristics of the impact of
   urbanization on carbon emissions from urban residential buildings from a
   multidimensional perspective, starting from five dimensions: population,
   economy, land, life, and ecology, using a spatial-temporal
   geographically weighted regression model (GTWR) and panel data from 30
   provinces in China for the period 2010-2020. The findings of this study
   revealed that, on the whole, population urbanization, land urbanization,
   and lifestyle urbanization exert a significant facilitating influence on
   carbon emissions from urban residential buildings. Conversely, economic
   urbanization exhibits a notable inhibitory effect on carbon emissions
   from urban residential buildings. Furthermore, ecological urbanization
   transitions from an inhibitory effect to a promoting effect on carbon
   emissions from urban residential buildings. The impact of urbanization
   across various dimensions on carbon emissions from urban residential
   buildings displays spatiotemporal heterogeneity across different regions
   and periods. In addition, the structure of energy consumption is a
   contributing factor to the increase in carbon emissions from urban
   residential buildings, while there is a notable U-shaped relationship
   between the level of foreign investment, the industrial structure, and
   carbon emissions originating from urban residential areas. This study
   offers profound insights into the relationship between urbanization and
   carbon emissions, providing valuable guidance for policymakers.},

Abstract = {The integration of blockchain and digital twins (DT) for better
   building-lifecycle data management has recently received much attention
   from researchers in the field. In this respect, the adoption of enabling
   technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
   (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and edge computing, Big Data
   analytics, etc., has also been investigated in an abundance of studies.
   The present review inspects the recent studies to shed light on the
   foremost among those enabling technologies and their scope, challenges,
   and integration potential. To this end, 86 scientific papers, recognized
   and retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, were
   reviewed and a thorough bibliometric analysis was performed on them. The
   obtained results demonstrate the nascency of the research in this field
   and the necessity of further implementation of practical methods to
   discover and prove the real potential of these technologies and their
   fusion. It was also found that the integration of these technologies can
   be beneficial for addressing the implementation challenges they face
   individually. In the end, an abstract descriptive model is presented to
   provide a better understanding of how the technologies can become
   integrated into a unified system for smartening the built environment.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been rapidly transforming the
   Architectural, Engineering, \& Construction (AEC) industry throughout
   the lifecycle of the building. BIM functions as a single database of
   fully integrated and interoperable information that can be used by all
   members of the design and construction team and ultimately, by operators
   throughout a facility's lifecycle (Holenss G.V.R 2008). The advantages
   of utilizing BIM in the Facility Management (FM) stage have been well
   documented in the literature (Stravoravdis and Ashworth 2015.),
   (Gokstorp 2012.) \& (Becerik-Gerber et al. 2012.). The initial
   hypothesis for this study was that the use of BIM by our in-house FM
   staff would significantly reduce the amount of time needed to locate
   HVAC equipment in the building that needs maintenance or repair.
   However, currently, BIM is not as widely implemented in the FM stage as
   it is in the design stage (Akcamete et al 2010.). Lack of or restricted
   access to the BIM model for multiple existing buildings is the first
   major challenge to BIM adoption for FM. The lack of BIM software
   experience for FM personnel and the high purchase cost of the software
   also presents significant challenges. Most of the latest Building
   Management Systems (BMS) inform the FM personnel about the problematic
   equipment through their equipment IDs but fail to locate the coordinates
   of that equipment. The FM personnel mostly use paper-based drawings and
   spend hours locating problematic equipment in the building that is
   flagged by the BMS. For many building managers and design professionals,
   the visualization of building information for analysis, benchmarking,
   and diagnostics remains a time-intensive, do-it-yourself undertaking
   (Lehrer 2010.). Hence, the goal of the study is to provide FM personnel
   with a simple-to-use spatial visualization dashboard that would save
   them time and money. This study showcases a methodology to spatially
   visualize the performance of buildings' HVAC systems systematically. The
   proposed workflow is tested on an existing office building in Utah and
   as part of the scope of the study, only the performance of Variable Air
   Volume (VAV) boxes is spatially visualized. An automated dashboard is
   created for visualizing the VAVs' performance score on a color-coded
   map. As the dashboard is automated to updated regularly, FM personnel
   can track the performance and exact location of the problematic VAVs
   just by opening the dashboard. FM personnel may now infer correlations
   in the equipment failure, by integrating the time and spatial
   relationships on the dashboard. Even though previous studies have
   already dealt with visualizing the sensor data, like temperature, on
   floor plans, the novel idea of this study is to visualize equipment's
   performance on an ongoing basis. Just visualizing the sensor data would
   not help FM personnel diagnose the issue. Future studies may investigate
   ways to scale up the scope of the study to large buildings. Future
   studies may also provide preventive maintenance recommendations on the
   dashboard by analyzing real-time and historical data using machine
   learning techniques.},

Title = {Survey on the use of BIM methodology for railway 3D modeling},
Journal = {DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {This article explores the development of Augmented Reality (AR) models
   for railway projects, as illustrated in Fig. 1, with particular emphasis
   on interoperability between different systems and platforms. The
   historical development of Building In- formation Modeling (BIM) is
   traced from its origins in computer-aided de- sign (CAD) to its recent
   applications in diverse fields. Significant milestones and the evolution
   of BIM into project lifecycle management are highlighted. Fundamental
   aspects such as Level of Development (LOD) and Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) file types are reviewed. The integration of BIM with
   machine learning and AR has enormous po- tential to improve asset
   management and decision-making in railway projects. The importance of
   interoperability when integrating AR into railway projects using BIM
   methodology, highlighting tools and models that ensure seamless
   operation across various platforms and software systems, is discussed.
   Stan- dards such as ISO 19650 and ISO 16739 are fundamental in this
   context. Studies that demonstrate the advantages of BIM in railway
   projects, in- cluding cost control, error detection and better
   maintenance planning, are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities
   associated with integrating BIM into rail are discussed, including the

Title = {A regression-based model for estimating the energy consumption of school
   facilities in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {237},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {A considerable amount of the oil used in Saudi Arabia is consumed to
   generate power. In an effort to minimize such consumption, the
   government of Saudi Arabia has established an ambitious part of the 2030
   Vision that includes 96 strategic objectives. In recent years, the
   advancement in information technology has made it possible to develop
   accurate prediction models of energy consumption for constructed
   facilities, which can assist with establishing plans to reduce future
   energy consumption. This research proposes a regression-based model for
   predicting the energy consumption of one of the most significant
   energy-consuming types of facilities in Saudi Arabia: schools. The model
   was developed utilizing 350 actual data points of energy consumption
   gathered from schools operating in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.
   The factors affecting consumption of energy were identified from two
   sources. The first was a review of the literature, and the second was
   interviews with local experts. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the
   most important factors (i.e., inputs/independent variables) affecting
   energy consumption (i.e., output) were AC capacity and building age. An
   investigation of the correlations among the independent variables
   revealed that the highest correlation of 0.864 was found between the
   total built area and total roof area. The developed model was validated
   using 35 new data points of school buildings across the eastern province
   of Saudi Arabia. The results show that the model predicted the energy
   consumption of school buildings with an accuracy higher than 90\%. The
   findings of this study will assist schools and maintenance managers in
   effectively managing such facilities by allowing them to allocate the
   required budget in advance. Also, the predictions can be used economic
   lifecycle analysis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Options for and Challenges of Employing Digital Twins in Construction
   Management},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The notions of smart construction and smart or digital cities include
   many modern concepts that are advocated today, especially in countries
   with advanced economies, and depend on using information technology and
   the Internet of Things as a basis to automate processes and activate
   digital systems to manage activities and services related to the
   operation of buildings and urban structures. In light of the spread of
   digital technology and modern managerial approaches, the concept of a
   digital twin is being used on a large scale with the current trend and
   direction to digitalize activities providing many economic, social and
   technical advantages. A digital twin is a system in which a virtual
   representation of a real entity or physical system is used continuously
   by being fed with data and deriving outputs in the form of decisions and
   actions that are generated through the processes of machine learning,
   simulation, development and lifecycle management. This study aims to
   review the literature on construction project management through the
   lens of digital twins and ways to use them in the field to improve
   operational results. The authors propose a framework for analyzing and
   supervising the development of digital twins that uses three main
   stages: the commonly encountered Building Information Modeling (BIM);
   the existing monitoring and actuation digital twins; and an envisioned
   third stage that makes use of artificial intelligence, complex
   visualization instruments and advanced controls with the capability to
   exact change within a construction project on the building site.},

Abstract = {The emergent Zero touch Service and Management (ZSM) paradigm aims to
   automate the orchestration and management of running network slices, in
   Beyond 5G networks (B5G), with an unprecedented level of scalability. To
   achieve this vision, ZSM calls for a large usage of advanced deep
   learning algorithms, in order to dynamically build efficient decisions.
   In this context, Federated deep Learning (FL) proved their efficiency in
   not only building collaborative deep learning models, among several
   network slices, but also ensuring the privacy and isolation of such
   network slices. Indeed, FL-based solutions give ``machine-centric{''}
   decisions about running network slices and their performance, which will
   be then executed/applied by managers, i.e., slice manager staff/module.
   However, FL-enabled solutions do not provide any details about why and
   how such decisions were made, and thus such decisions cannot be properly
   trusted/understood by slice managers. To alleviate this issue, we
   leverage eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) paradigm that aims to
   improve the transparency of black-box FL decision-making process. In
   particular, XAI helps to explain the FL-based decisions to make them
   interpretable/trustable by network slices managers. In this paper, we
   design a novel XAI-powered framework to explain FL-based decisions. We
   first build a deep learning model in federated way, to predict key
   performance indicators (KPI) of network slices. Our FL-based KPI
   prediction is useful for the configuration and the management of network
   slice lifecycle, especially for the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
   violation and the network slice re-configuration. Then, we develop
   several XAI models on the top of our FL-based model, such as SHapley
   Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
   Explanations (LIME), RuleFit, and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), to
   enhance the level of trust, credibility (of the local data/model),
   transparency, and explanation of the FL-based decisions, while adhering
   the data privacy, to different B5G network stakeholders, such as slice
   managers. Experiments results show the efficiency of our XAI-powered
   framework, to explain FL-based decisions related to latency KPI
   predictions.},

Abstract = {Due to the course of popular and commercial marketing, many buildings
   have not originally been designed by the users' individual diversity and
   requirements. As the existing building structure is difficult to be a
   change, in view of environmental protection and energy conservation
   issues, the proportion of reuse of the old buildings during their
   lifecycle is increasing, hence the flexible and variable floor would be
   the prevalence of interior decoration. In addition, upon the limitation
   of land resource and the high-rising trends of building development in
   Taiwan, and in case the building users or owners usually have not the
   ownership of their upper/underneath -story space, to solve the vertical
   noise interference would be the important issue for enhancement of
   acoustic environment quality. This study attempts to build a numerical
   analysis model to predict the effects of interior flexible and variable
   floor coping with the floor impact sound, by setting examples of the
   raised floor. The experiments and the assessments by use of light floor
   impact source in a full-scale chamber have proceeded. A Finite Element
   Method (FEM) model is built through a series of theory analysis and
   practical examination, and is demonstrated the effectiveness after
   comparison with the test data obtained from full-scale chamber
   experiments. On the basis of the effective FEM model, the different
   component factors of the raised floor upon the effects of floor impact
   sound insulation are examined by regression.},

Title = {Heterogeneity in Trajectories of Life Satisfaction After Reunification:
   The Role of Individual Resources and Life Stage in Former East Germany},

Abstract = {For people living in the former East Germany, reunification with the
   former West Germany fundamentally transformed the sociopolitical system
   and most domains of everyday life. Previous research has revealed
   temporal shifts in average life satisfaction after reunification in the
   former East German population as a whole, but so far little is known
   about heterogeneity in patterns of adjustment within the population.
   Building on evidence of considerable diversity in trajectories of
   adjustment to other critical life events, in the current study we use
   longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and growth
   mixture models to identify typical yet distinct trajectories of life
   satisfaction among former East Germans, covering the period just before
   reunification and four years thereafter. We identified four
   trajectories: continuously satisfied (experienced by 17\% of the
   sample), upward adjusters (24\%), downward adjusters (34\%), and
   continuously dissatisfied (25\%). Results of logistic regression
   analyses indicate that the propensity to follow a particular trajectory
   was strongly predicted by an individual's baseline economic (employment,
   but not income), socio-relational (loneliness) and personal (education,
   satisfaction with health) resources. Whereas former East Germans with
   more resources just prior to reunification were more likely to maintain
   high or increase in life satisfaction, their peers with fewer resources
   were more apt to either maintain low or decrease in life satisfaction.
   People in their mid-twenties through mid-fifties (i.e., prime working
   age) at the time of reunification were also more likely to maintain low
   life satisfaction. Accordingly, reunification affected the unfolding of
   individual lives differently.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin Technology has taken the place in top 10 strategic
   technology trends in 2017 termed by Gartner Inc. Digital Twin concept
   brings out the virtual depiction or the digital representation of the
   real world equipment, device or system whereas the real world and the
   virtual world gets the highest synchronization. The digital
   representation of the complete life cycle of a product from its design
   phase to the maintenance phase will give the prophetic analysis of the
   problems to the business. This greatest advantage of foreseeing problems
   in the development of a device will give early warnings, foil downtime,
   cultivate novel prospects and inventing enhanced devices or gadgets for
   the later use at the lesser expense by means of digital representations.
   Indeed, these will devise a larger influence on conveying superior
   consumer feeling also in the enterprise. The emerging trends such as
   Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Internet of
   Things and Big Data used in Industry 4.0 play a vital role in Digital
   Twin and they are mostly adopted in the world of manufacturing,
   Industrial Internet of Things, and automobile business world. The
   penetration, wide coverage and the advancement of the Internet of Things
   in real-world have elevated the power of Digital Twins more economical
   and reachable for the world of various businesses.
   1. Manufacturing: Digital Twin has brought out the change in the
   existing manner of the manufacturing segment. Digital Twins have a
   substantial influence on the design of products and their manufacturing
   and maintenance. Because of its influence the manufacturing more
   competent and augmented while dropping throughput times.
   2. Industrial IoT: Integrating digital twin with industrial firms will
   facilitate the activities such as monitoring, tracking and controlling
   industrial systems in digital means. We can potentially experience the
   power of digital twin since it captures environmental data such as
   locality, settings of the devices, financial frameworks, etc., other
   than the operational data, which benefits in foreseeing the forthcoming
   operations and incongruities.
   3. Healthcare: Since the healthcare sector demands higher accuracy in
   diagnosis and treatment, with the important data from IoT, digital twins
   can play a vital role by reducing the expense for the patient,
   precautionary alerts to avoid health deterioration and giving tailored
   health support system. This will be great support especially in
   developing countries like India.
   4. Smart cities: Digital Twin coupled with IoT data can augment the
   efficient planning of the smart city and execution of its building by
   supplementing financial progress, effectual administration of resources,
   lessening of environmental impression and escalate the complete worth of
   a resident's life. The digital twin prototypical can aid city organizers
   and legislators in the smart city planning by retrieving the visions
   from numerous sensor networks and smart systems. The information
   received from the digital twins supports them in reaching well-versed
   choices concerning the future as well.
   5. Automobile: Automobile industry can get voluminous benefits out of
   Digital Twins for producing the simulated framework of a coupled
   vehicle. It retrieves the behavioral and functional information of the
   vehicle and services in examining the inclusive performance efficiency
   of the vehicle as well as the features connected along with it. Digital
   Twin also supports in supplying a justly enhance support and service for
   the consumers.
   6. Retail: Alluring client satisfaction is a fundamental factor in the
   merchandising world. Digital twin employment can play a key role in
   supplementing the retail customer experience by forming virtual twins
   for customers and modeling fashions for them on it. Digital Twins also
   supports enhanced planning of stock maintenance, safekeeping procedures,
   and human resource administration in an augmented means.
   The word `digital twin' was, to begin with, devised in item development
   administration in 2003 when computerized illustrations of physical items
   were still in their infancy. With the development of computational power
   and the devices intertwined with the Internet, Digital Twins are
   presently picking up footing over businesses of various fields. They
   were as of late named one of the greatest 10 significant innovation
   patterns in 2018 by Gartner.},

Abstract = {Studies about the variables that determine the ability to innovate at
   sectoral level are scarce and present a series of limitations. This
   paper tries to bridge this gap by building a model of sector innovation
   capacity based upon existing approaches related to the study of sectoral
   innovation (lifecycles of industries, evolutionary theory and the
   sectoral innovation systems approach) and a model of determinants for
   national innovation capacity. The empirical analysis is based upon data
   from the Survey on Innovation of Firms for Spain and the methods used
   comprise the application of panel data, factor analysis and ordinary
   least squares regression analysis. The main findings of the paper are
   the confirmation of the relevance of all the variables in determining
   sector innovation capacity, the formulation of the sector innovation
   capacity determinants model, the consistency of the proposed model
   confirming both the validity and appropriateness of the variables
   identified and, therefore, the value of using the variety of approaches
   selected.},

Title = {Recalibrating the epigenetic clock: implications for assessing

Abstract = {Human DNA methylation data have been used to develop biomarkers of
   ageing, referred to as `epigenetic clocks', which have been widely used
   to identify differences between chronological age and biological age in
   health and disease including neurodegeneration, dementia and other brain
   phenotypes. Existing DNA methylation clocks have been shown to be highly
   accurate in blood but are less precise when used in older samples or in
   tissue types not included in training the model, including brain. We
   aimed to develop a novel epigenetic clock that performs optimally in
   human cortex tissue and has the potential to identify phenotypes
   associated with biological ageing in the brain. We generated an
   extensive dataset of human cortex DNA methylation data spanning the life
   course (n=1397, ages = 1 to 108 years). This dataset was split into
   `training' and `testing' samples (training: n=1047; testing: n=350). DNA
   methylation age estimators were derived using a transformed version of
   chronological age on DNA methylation at specific sites using elastic net
   regression, a supervised machine learning method. The cortical clock was
   subsequently validated in a novel independent human cortex dataset
   (n=1221, ages = 41 to 104 years) and tested for specificity in a large
   whole blood dataset (n=1175, ages = 28 to 98 years). We identified a set
   of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination, optimally predict age
   in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites
   weighted by their regression coefficients provide the cortical DNA
   methylation clock age estimate. The novel clock dramatically
   outperformed previously reported clocks in additional cortical datasets.
   Our findings suggest that previous associations between predicted DNA
   methylation age and neurodegenerative phenotypes might represent false
   positives resulting from clocks not robustly calibrated to the tissue
   being tested and for phenotypes that become manifest in older ages. The
   age distribution and tissue type of samples included in training
   datasets need to be considered when building and applying epigenetic
   clock algorithms to human epidemiological or disease cohorts.},

Abstract = {We live in an era of unprecedented technology. Millions of users depend
   on information technology to carry out their daily lives and large-scale
   commercial and industrial operations are no exception. At the same time,
   the rapidly growing interconnectivity of IT systems and the surge in
   cybercrime since the pandemic have rendered industry-standard hardware
   and software components increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks.
   Cyber defense is a coordinated act of resistance that intends to
   understand the capabilities and motives of attackers in order to secure
   our country's data and more importantly, the livelihoods of our
   citizens. This research aims to contribute to the progress of
   cybersecurity and defense technology as a whole by focusing on a dynamic
   aspect of malware: digital unwanted advertisements. It presents a novel
   approach to automating the analysis of malicious content on the internet
   by web scraping ads of the popular search engine Google to extract
   relevant data (URL, Company, Title, Product Desc.), building machine
   learning models (supervised \& unsupervised) to classify and make
   predictions on that data, and creating a web application for end users
   to access. The results show that our tool can detect trends within the
   features with limited false positives, paving the way for us to make
   predictions on whether the advertisements are desirable or unwanted. The
   research concludes that in this time and age, it is extremely important
   to protect against fraud, especially by adhering to cybersecurity's best
   practices and to think about threats in more global terms. Our hope with
   this research is to prompt action to ensure society continues to improve
   in IT resilience.},

Title = {Review of non-domestic building stock modelling studies under
   socio-technical system framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The construction industry contributes to approximately 30\% of global
   energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, necessitating urgent
   measures to mitigate carbon emissions and address climate problems. This
   study focuses on the underexplored realm of Non-domestic Building Stock
   (NDBS), which constitutes 8\% of global energy consumption and 11\% of
   worldwide carbon emissions. Due to the long lifecycle of buildings, a
   comprehensive assessment of the NDBS is imperative to achieve the goal
   of net-zero carbon buildings by 2050. The current NDBS studies can be
   categorised into two groups based on the geographic location and type of
   building being studied. Each of these two different building stocks
   demonstrates different research and analysis tools, but specific
   comparisons have not yet been made between them. In addition, existing
   literature reviews of NDBS have mainly emphasised the technical aspects
   and neglected their social aspects. This study aims to critically review
   the energy and carbon footprint related efforts in NDBS research, assess
   the current state of research, and propose potential research trends.
   Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 99 out of 906 articles are
   fully reviewed. Utilising and adapting the Social-Technical Systems
   (STS) approach, this study analyses the data requirements, research
   methods, and research objectives of NDBS studies concerning energy
   consumption and carbon footprint from five perspectives, namely
   infrastructure, technology, processes, goals, and people. Results
   demonstrate that geo-stock and type-stock approaches, while focusing on
   different aspects of building stock, can share data and analysis methods
   to improve research efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally,
   findings highlight that incorporating socio-economic factors into
   technical models can enhance model robustness and output reliability,
   thereby supporting effective policy-making and energy management
   strategies. This study provides a new multidimensional approach to
   evaluate the development of NDBS energy and carbon footprint research,
   and helps to incorporate socio-economic analysis into NDBS physics-based
   models to improve the efficiency and reliability of such models for
   future research and practice.},

Abstract = {Modern materials science research problems present a challenge to data
   science and analytics as experiments generate Petabyte-scale
   spatiotemporal datasets that span a number of modalities and formats.
   Creating computing infrastructure and frameworks that support the scale
   and diversity of materials science data while remaining accessible for
   materials scientists to use is a non-trivial task. We have developed the
   Common Research Analytics and Data Lifecycle Environment (CRADLE) to
   solve the challenges of materials data science through a scalable
   research computing framework and cyber infrastructure that can (1)
   handle large-scale, heterogeneous datasets (2) provide a flexible
   toolbox for building machine learning pipelines that span from ingestion
   to model deployment (3) be accessible to research scientists with
   limited to extensive computational backgrounds and (4) utilize a myriad
   of low performance to high performance computer systems.
   CRADLE is a framework that integrates distributed systems like Hadoop
   and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure to handle materials
   data at scale. This all enables the general materials data scientist to
   query Petabytes of data and train thousands of models in a parallel,
   distributed environment. We demonstrate three use cases for CRADLE to
   benchmark its capability to ingest and analyze spatiotemporal materials
   data at scale. These tasks span three data modalities: transforming 2.6
   billion Photovoltaic time-series power measurements, training hundreds
   of deep learning models on Atomic Force Microscopy images, and ingesting
   27 billion geospatial data points. CRADLE exemplifies an overarching
   framework that accelerates time to science, extends to other domains
   with similar challenges, and expands the horizon of data science and
   research.},

Title = {Advanced informatic technologies for intelligent construction: A review},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Number = {A},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since there is a growing interest in driving the digital transformation
   of the construction industry, the goal of this paper is to provide a
   full picture and understanding of the emerging research front on
   intelligent construction. Through the quantitative and qualitative
   analysis, relevant pieces of literature are thoroughly reviewed to
   extract useful knowledge to raise awareness of intelligent construction,
   resulting in the summary of research status and the determination of
   future needs. In light of the research findings, the rapid development
   of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization,
   digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and
   customization, which mainly support ``4S{''} technologies. The popular
   research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the
   project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which
   are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and
   automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for
   future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud
   platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability
   under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. As for the practical
   value, a synthesized point of up-to-date reference is created to guide
   managers to promote intelligent construction in real-world engineering.},

Abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with
   more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that
   scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release
   of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8\% of worldwide carbon
   emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient
   in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas
   that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering
   performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically
   for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of
   data centers.
   In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a
   type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model,
   to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is
   trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning
   Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle
   analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design
   concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing
   formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report
   laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated
   formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design
   requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready
   Mix-a concrete supplier-to generate field-ready concrete formulations,
   based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design.
   Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the
   construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in
   DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this
   real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated
   low-carbon concrete mixes.},

Abstract = {Mobile applications are one of the most common software projects written
   nowadays. The software architectures used for building those type of
   products heavily impacts their lifecycle as the architectural issues
   affect the internal quality of a software system hindering its
   maintainability and extensibility. We are presenting a novel approach,
   Clustering ARchitecture Layers (CARL), for detecting architectural
   layers using an automatic method that could represent the first step in
   the identification and elimination of various architectural smells.
   Unlike supervised Machine Learning approaches, the involved clustering
   method does not require any initial training data or modelling phase to
   set up the detecting system. As a further key of novelty, the method
   works by considering as codebase's hybrid features the information
   inferred from both module dependency graph and the mobile SDKs. Our
   approach considers and fuses various types of structural as well as
   lexical dependencies extracted from the codebase, it analyses the types
   of the components, their methods signatures as well as their properties.
   Our method is a generic one and can be applied to any presentational
   applications that use SDKs for building their user interfaces. We assess
   the effectiveness of our proposed layer detection approach over three
   public and private codebases of various dimensions and complexities.
   External and internal clustering metrics were used to evaluate the
   detection quality, obtaining an Average Accuracy of 77,95\%. Moreover,
   the Precision measure was computed for each layer of the investigated
   codebase architectures and the average of this metric (over all layers
   and codebases) is 79,32\% while the average Recall on all layers
   obtained is 75,93\%.},

Title = {A comprehensive approach for calibrating anthropogenic effects on
   atmosphere degradation},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {191},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is the most pervasive threat to the ecosystem, species
   survival, global economy, and urban lives. Global citizens and
   governments have perceived the alleviation of harmful anthropogenic
   effects as an urgent priority. However, conflicting interests between
   interest groups preclude achieving a common goal. The convincing
   solutions fundamentally proceed from the precise calibration.
   Considerable efforts have established calibration models where
   population density and road transportation have been investigated as
   major proxies. The model components generally involve spatiotemporal
   characteristics, but the consideration of time-varying, spatially
   correlated attributes is insufficient. This article presents a pilot
   approach in a comprehensive manner; it includes a spatial feature
   transformation procedure called Kriging for spatial consistency and
   applying model-fitting and explanation techniques. In the case study,
   the regression models fit by OLS, Ridge, and Lasso showed analogous
   coefficients for SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 emissions, whereas
   the magnitudes and directions extracted by classification techniques
   such as ANN and XGBoost vary with emission intensity. This quantitative
   interpretation based on coefficients or weights could be incompatible
   with qualitative aspects. As an alternative, this article applied SHAP
   technique to XGBoost so that the discovery of multidirectional
   relationships complemented this incongruity. In conclusion, the model
   design needs to encompass the whole process from recognizing data
   properties to eliciting high accuracy and scientific proof for
   efficacious policies and schemes. Environmental action building on valid
   models would promise to alleviate climate risks and sustain lives.},

Abstract = {Making errors during software development is unavoidable. Developers
   inevitably make errors that take additional time to fix later.
   Consequently, efforts for bug fixing compete with implementing new
   features. Typically, the later bugs are found, the higher the cost for
   remediation. To address this concern, software testing should start as
   early as possible in software development lifecycle. For this purpose,
   static analysis is proposed, but typically shows too many findings and
   hence do not support development teams appropriately. So, it would be a
   benefit to premature detect those findings in static analysis that will
   result in failures to reduce subsequent efforts notably. The purpose of
   the paper is to analyze failure data from issue tracking systems that
   are correlated to findings from static analysis. Thereupon an artificial
   intelligence-based approach is used to train practicable models for
   business environment that enables effective prediction of software
   faults. The results from static analysis show that predefined complexity
   measures encompassed the most defects. While there are commonalities in
   relevant defect findings in static analysis reports, meaningful
   prediction models cannot be expected based solely on this data. In
   addition to the findings of the static analysis, metrics like code
   changes in a time period or number of authors involved in code changes
   were considered for building the prediction models. Two of the developed
   prediction models have a high accuracy and excellent utility rate. These
   resulting prediction models are currently used at Raiffeisen Software
   GmbH for a long-term study on failure prediction based on code smells.},

Abstract = {NASA is conducting the Airspace Technology Demonstration-2 to evaluate
   an Integrated Arrival, Departure, and Surface (IADS) traffic management
   system. The IADS system is powered by real-time System Wide Information

   lifecycle of a flight. This data can be leveraged to drive efficiencies
   in the National Airspace System. For non safety critical applications
   there is opportunity for third party service providers to offer this
   type of data-driven prediction service in near real-time. This paper
   investigates the gate conflict prediction problem as a concrete use case
   which could help drive efficiencies. We model gate conflicts as a
   regression problem and describe the iterative process of model building,
   model validation, and evaluation used to assess the efficacy of our
   approach. We quantify our predictive accuracy and identify paths for

Abstract = {The process engineering discipline has been largely excluded from
   Digital Transformation trends. The objective of this presentation is to
   provide an overview of the obstacles to Digital Transformation for the
   process discipline and explain how these can be overcome. A special
   emphasis will be given on the role of the process simulation tool (white
   box modelling) as a catalyst for transformational change.
   The presentation will examine several challenges specific to process
   engineering:
   1) Process simulators are divided into single-purpose point solutions.
   Separate models may be created for process design, control strategy
   design, operator training simulation, performance monitoring and online
   optimization.
   2) Process simulators are typically poorly integrated into engineering
   workflows beyond the process world, and if so, with a single directional
   information flow.
   3) Legacy process simulators are overloaded with niche features and
   functions only usable by experts.
   4) The potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
   Learning for process engineering are not widely understood.
   Industry stakeholders see the Digital Twin as the most important
   building block for Digital Transformation of the process industries.
   While legacy simulators are well-suited to accurately simulate
   processes, their decades-old architectures mean they are not ideal to
   serve the entire plant lifecycle and support the Digital Transformation.
   We will use the AVEVA SimCentral Simulation Platform(4) as an example of
   how the identified obstacles can be overcome with a next generation
   process simulator. Case examples from leading companies will be
   outlined.},

Abstract = {Enterprise IT performance can be improved by providing reactive and
   predictive monitoring tools that anticipate problem detection. It
   requires advanced approaches for creating more agile, adaptable,
   sustainable and intelligent information systems. Service-oriented
   architecture (SOA) has been used in significant performance-based
   approaches by information system practitioners. Organizations are
   interested in performance-based decision support along the layers of SOA
   to maintain their sustainability for service reuse. Reusability is a
   very important aspect of Service-based systems (SBS) to analyze service
   or process reuse. This helps in achieving business agility to meet
   changing marketplace needs. However currently, there are many challenges
   pertaining tothe complexities of service reuse evolution along SBS.
   These challenges are related to the sustainability of service behavior
   during its lifecycle and the limitations of existing monitoring tools.
   There is a need for a consolidated classified knowledge-based
   performance profile, analytical assessment, prediction and
   recommendation. Therefore, this paper provides a semantic
   performance-oriented decision support system (SPODSS) for SOA. SPODSS
   provides recommendations for suggesting service reuse during its
   evolution. SPODSS is supported by five building blocks. These blocks are
   data, semantic, traces, machine learning, and decision. SPODSS classify
   data, validate (analytical assessment, traces, semantic enrichment) at
   different time intervals and increased consumption and prediction based
   on consolidated results. It handles the dynamic evolution of SBS and new
   or changed user requirements by ontology development. Finally, SPODSS
   generates recommendations for atomic service, composite service, and
   resourceallocation provisioning. To motivate this approach, we
   illustrate the implementation of the proposed algorithms for all the
   five blocks by a business process use case and public data set
   repositories of shared services. Sustainability and adaptability of
   service-based systems areensured by handling new business requirements,
   dynamicity issues and ensuring performance. Performance criterion
   includes functional suitability, time behavior, resource utilization,
   and reliability in terms of availability, maturity, and risk.},

Abstract = {Drosophila experimental evolution, with its well-defined selection
   protocols, has long supplied useful genetic material for the analysis of
   functional physiology. While there is a long tradition of interpreting
   the effects of large-effect mutants physiologically, identifying and
   interpreting gene-to-phenotype relationships has been challenging in the
   genomic era, with many labs not resolving how physiological traits are
   affected by multiple genes throughout the genome. Drosophila
   experimental evolution has demonstrated that multiple phenotypes change
   because of the evolution of many loci across the genome, creating the
   scientific challenge of sifting out differentiated but noncausal loci
   for individual characters. The fused lasso additive model method allows
   us to infer some of the differentiated loci that have relatively greater
   causal effects on the differentiation of specific phenotypes. The
   experimental material that we use in the present study comes from 50
   populations that have been selected for different life histories and
   levels of stress resistance. Differentiation of cardiac robustness,
   starvation resistance, desiccation resistance, lipid content, glycogen
   content, water content, and body masses was assayed among 40-50 of these
   experimentally evolved populations. Through the fused lasso additive
   model, we combined physiological analyses from eight parameters with
   whole-body pooled-seq genomic data to identify potentially causally
   linked genomic regions. We have identified approximately 2,176
   significantly differentiated 50-kb genomic windows among our 50
   populations, with 142 of those identified genomic regions that are
   highly likely to have a causal effect connecting specific genome sites
   to specific physiological characters.},

   Source Reference Implementation},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, many proposals of context-aware systems applied to
   IoT-based smart environments have been presented in the literature. Most
   previous works provide a generic high-level structure of how a
   context-aware system can be operationalized, but do not offer clues on
   how to implement it. On the other hand, there are many implementations
   of context-aware systems applied to specific IoT-based smart
   environments that are context-specific: it is not clear how they can be
   extended to other use cases. In this article, we aim to provide an
   open-source reference implementation for providing context-aware data
   analytics capabilities to IoT-based smart environments. We rely on the
   building blocks of the FIWARE ecosystem and the NGSI data standard,
   providing an agnostic end-to-end solution that considers the complete
   data lifecycle, covering from data acquisition and modeling, to data
   reasoning and dissemination. In other words, our reference
   implementation can be readily operationalized in any IoT-based smart
   environment regardless of its field of application, providing a
   context-aware solution that is not context-specific. Furthermore, we
   provide two example use cases that showcase how our reference
   implementation can be used in a variety of fields.},

Title = {Effect of uncontrolled industrialization on environmental parameter: A
   case study of Mongla EPZ using machine learning approach},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Unplanned and uncontrolled industrialization leads to environmental
   pollution, which ends up impacting human life and destroying the
   economy. Especially in the era of global warming, coastal regions
   worldwide are the most vulnerable and hold significant ecological
   importance for human habitation. In 1998, the establishment of the
   Mongla Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) in the coastal town of Mongla
   Thana, which is already famous for its seaport, led the area to the
   challenges of salinity intrusion and the shrinking of agricultural land
   and its fertility. Unplanned industrialization in the area causes
   vegetation loss, severe droughts, and other environmental challenges,
   threatening local biodiversity and agricultural sustainability. In this
   paper, the effects of unplanned industrialization inside the Mongla EPZ
   on the area land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and
   urban heat island (UHI) spanning from 2007 to 2023 have been
   investigated. Along with that, a machine-learning-based artificial
   neural network (ANN) model was employed to forecast the situation in
   2027 and 2031. Our industrial settlement analysis reveals that a
   substantial rise in industrial building was seen in 2015 in the EPZ
   area, whereas the EPZ area was almost settlement- free before 2011. With
   this increase in 2015, above 2\% of the total municipal area faced
   drought, which will become over 30\% by 2023. The NDVI values are
   decreasing year-wise, which reveals that the area is becoming less
   vegetation-rich. Also, the increasing industrial activities in the EPZ
   led to an LST increment. Our CA-ANN algorithm-based future prediction
   shows that about 30\% of the whole municipality will face LST 27 degrees
   C by 2031. Along with that, the area's UHI value, over 2 degrees C
   higher than the rural surrounding area, will reach 6.5\% by 2031. Our
   findings indicate that the municipal area will face a devastating
   future, including vegetation loss, a high probability of severe drought,
   and ultimately, environmental degradation. This study will help raising
   awareness and decision-making process to mitigate the environmental
   risks and supporting sustainable development.},

Abstract = {At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into
   a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of
   various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under
   complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial
   intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration
   of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction
   projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear
   understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction
   management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive
   investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility
   to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of
   automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis
   and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the
   status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire
   lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords
   that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning,
   internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving
   as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional
   civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the
   log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and
   discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and
   rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building
   performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin.
   Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to
   more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of
   human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain,
   aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.},

   (GHG) emitters worldwide, mainly due to its heavy reliance on coal for
   energy. The residential building industry can play a significant role
   towards the minimization of both GHG emissions and energy consumption.
   This research assesses the beneficial impacts of utilizing wall envelope
   insulation measures using five insulation materials, for a detached
   residential building, within the seven energy zones of South Africa in
   accordance with the South African National code for Building energy
   efficiency (SANS10400-XA).Methods: Lifecycle analysis (for 50 years),
   regression methods and sequential search techniques of building energy
   modelling were used to determine both the energy saving implications of
   adopting the insulation materials (at various levels of thickness), and
   their corresponding energy payback periods. The study area consisted of
   eight selected locations representing all the seven energy zones in
   South Africa (Welkom, Witbank, Thohoyandou, Cape Town, Pretoria, Ixopo,
   Sutherland, and Fraserburg).Results: Sutherland (zone 6), Cape Town
   (zone 4) and Fraserburg (zone 7) benefitted most from energy savings due
   to application of insulation measures. Witbank (Zone 2), Thohoyandou
   (zone 3) and Pretoria (zone 5) never benefitted from application of wall
   envelope insulation (in terms of energy savings). Cellulose and straw
   yielded the lowest payback periods. Generally, polyurethane yielded the
   highest net energy savings at lower insulation thickness levels, while
   cellulose was preferable at higher insulation thickness levels in Welkom
   (zone1) Cape Town (zone 4), Ixopo (zone 5H), Sutherland (zone 6) and
   Fraserburg (zone 7).Discussion: Lower optimal wall envelope insulation
   thicknesses (that maximized energy savings) appeared to correspond to
   locations with higher annual temperature ranges. Higher temperature
   ranges (hence, higher degree days) would ensure that more energy is
   saved in order to keep the indoor temperatures within the acceptable
   comfort limits, due to application of insulation. However, the selection
   of insulation material is also influenced by other factors such as
   resistance to insect and mould attack (which easily affect
   bio-insulation materials), fire retardancy, durability (which affects
   cellulose), sound proofing, structural strength, and resistance to water
   vapour.},

Title = {Wood vs. brick: Impact on investment costs of houses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Reducing the environmental impact of buildings is the major priority of
   the construction industry. Wood and wooden products have considerable
   potential for the construction of buildings that satisfy the
   requirements of sustainable building. However, relevant cost information
   for wood based houses is unavailable. This is a barrier to responsible
   cost estimation in the pre construction phases of projects, as well as
   to proper lifecycle-cost analysis and optimisation. The present study
   had two objectives. The first was to answer the fundamental question of
   whether the investment costs of wood-based houses are lower than those
   of brick-based houses, with an emphasis on the construction systems
   commonly used in the Czech Republic. Ordinary least squares and
   generalised linear model regression analyses indicated that wood-based
   houses are 4.3\% more expensive than brick-based houses. The second
   objective of this study was to identify and verify other factors that
   influence the investment costs of houses in the Czech Republic. The
   research was conducted using databases containing 1520 catalogue houses
   with defined specifications and investment costs based on market data.
   Furthermore, single-floor houses were found to be more expensive than
   double-floor houses regardless of the material base. The design of
   easy-shaped houses is preferred to reduce the investment cost. The `m'
   index was not suitable for reflecting the house shape in the investment
   cost.},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: Fecal incontinence can have a profound effect on quality of
   life. Its prevalence remains uncertain because of stigma, lack of
   consistent definition, and dearth of validated measures. This study was
   designed to develop a valid clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire,
   building on current literature and expertise.
   METHODS: Patients and experts undertook face validity testing. Construct
   validity, criterion validity, and test-retest reliability was
   undertaken. Construct validity comprised factor analysis and internal
   consistency of the quality of life scale. The validity of known groups
   was tested against 77 control subjects by using regression models.
   Questionnaire results were compared with a stool diary for criterion
   validity. Test-retest reliability was calculated from repeated
   questionnaire completion.
   RESULTS: The questionnaire achieved good face validity. It was completed
   by 104 patients. The quality of life scale had four underlying traits
   (factor analysis) and high internal consistency (overall Cronbach
   alpha=0.97). Patients and control subjects answered the questionnaire
   significantly differently (P < 0.01) in known-groups validity testing.
   Criterion validity assessment found mean differences close to zero.
   Median reliability for the whole questionnaire was 0.79 (range, 0.35-1).
   CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire compares favorably with other available
   instruments, although the interpretation of stool consistency requires
   further research. Its sensitivity to treatment still needs to be
   investigated.},

Abstract = {The chaotic and dynamic nature of heat transfer results is either
   time-consuming or inaccurate predictions of the temperature field in
   simulations. In particular, the simulation of burning buildings is
   complex and at the same time the key enabler in saving lives and keeping
   property damage to a minimum. Deep Learning Neural Networks are a
   possibility to speed up the simulation process and make real-time
   predictions of temperature behavior or even replace the simulation
   process as a whole in the long run.
   This paper proposes a novel procedure to create a convolutional neural
   network-based method CNN1D3D, that is capable of approximating the
   behavior of temperature in burning rooms. The data used for training is
   created with time intensive, numerical simulations. CNN1D3D's
   architecture consists of an convolution-based temporal and spatial
   encoding as well of a transposed convolution based decoder, that creates
   temperature predictions in real-time.
   The work shows a possibility for a distinct feature extraction for
   temporal and spatial features. It shows how solutions generated by
   simulations based on differential equations hold implicitly the
   necessary information needed for the method to recreate the context of
   the data set. This forms a basis for the abstraction onto further fluid
   dynamics applications. This work has several real-world applications and
   forms the basis for future rescue route calculations. The solution can
   be generalized on other applications with similar data structures. It
   provides the opportunity to capture the complexity of interdependencies
   and correlations in the field of fluid dynamics. Copyright (c) 2024 The

Title = {CSViz: Class Separability Visualization for high-dimensional datasets},
Journal = {APPLIED INTELLIGENCE},

Abstract = {Data visualization is an essential task during the lifecycle of any Data
   Science (DS) project, particularly during the Exploratory Data Analysis
   (EDA) for a correct data preparation and understanding. In
   classification problems, data visualization is useful for revealing the
   existence of class separability patterns within the dataset. This
   information is very valuable and can be later used during the process of
   building a Machine Learning (ML) model. High-Dimensional Data (HDD)
   arise as one of the biggest challenges in DS. HDD require special
   treatment since traditional visualization techniques, such as the
   scatterplot matrix (SPLOM), have limitations when dealing with them due
   to space restrictions. Other visualization methods involve
   dimensionality reduction techniques, which can lead to losing important
   information and reducing the interpretability of the data. In this
   paper, the Class Separability Visualization (CSViz) method is introduced
   as a new Visual Analytics (VA) approach to address the challenge of
   visualizing labeled HDD through subspaces. The proposed method enables
   an overview of the class separability offering a series of 2-Dimensional
   subspaces visualizations containing exclusive subsets of points of the
   original variables that encompass the most valuable and significant
   separable patterns. The proposed method is tested over 50 datasets with
   different characteristics providing promising results. In all cases,
   more than 90\% of the data observations are shown with three plots or
   less. Hence, the presented CSViz significantly eases the EDA by reducing
   the number of plots to be inspected in a SPLOM and thus, the amount of
   time invested in it.Graphical AbstractCSViz graphical abstract},

Abstract = {The exponential increase in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
   has been accompanied by a spike in cyberattacks on IoT networks. In this
   research, we investigate the Bot-IoT dataset with a focus on classifying
   IoT reconnaissance attacks. Reconnaissance attacks are a foundational
   step in the cyberattack lifecycle. Our contribution is centered on the
   building of predictive models with the aid of Random Undersampling (RUS)
   and ensemble Feature Selection Techniques (FSTs). As far as we are
   aware, this type of experimentation has never been performed for the
   Reconnaissance attack category of BotIoT. Our work uses the Area Under
   the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) metric to quantify the
   performance of a diverse range of classifiers: Light GBM, CatBoost,
   XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB),
   Decision Tree (DT), and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). For this study,
   we determined that the best learners are DT and DT-based ensemble
   classifiers, the best RUS ratio is 1:1 or 1:3, and the best ensemble FST
   is our ``6 Agree{''} technique.},

Title = {Measurements and analysis of water content in winter wheat leaf based on

Abstract = {Wheat is a major grain crop in China. Water is one of the most important
   factors which influence the lifecycle and yield of wheat. It is of great
   significance to study the water content at key stages of wheat growth in
   order to make irrigation decision to raise its yield. As terahertz (THz)
   spectroscopy is a brand new sensing technology and sensitive to water
   absorption, the relationship between terahertz spectra and water content
   in winter wheat leaf was investigated and a preliminary result was
   presented in this paper. Forty winter wheat leaves samples with diverse
   range of water content (42.8\%-72.5\%) were collected. The Terahertz
   time domain spectra (THz-TDS) were first obtained and then transformed
   into Frequency-domain amplitude with the Fast Fourier Transformation
   (FFT) method. The absorption and refractive index spectra were then
   calculated. The spectra were linearly fitted to get the slope and
   intercept used for building a calibration model. The partial least
   squares (PLS) method and linear regression were employed to establish
   models to determine leaf water content in the winter wheat. The
   predicted correlation coefficient and the root mean square error of the
   optimal model established with the Frequency-domain amplitude parameter
   at 0.3 THz by linear regression were 0.812\% and 4.4\%, respectively.
   The results showed that terahertz spectroscopy performed well in water
   content prediction and could be an effective and potential method for
   leaf water content measurement in winter wheat.},

Title = {Predicting long-term average concentrations of traffic-related air
   pollutants using GIS-based information},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {542-553},

Abstract = {Global regression models were developed to estimate individual levels of
   long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants. The models are
   based on data of a one-year measurement programme including geographic
   data on traffic and population densities. This investigation is part of
   a cohort study on the impact of traffic-related air pollution on
   respiratory health, conducted at the westerly end of the Ruhr-area in
   North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany.
   Concentrations of NO2, fine particle mass (PM2.5) and filter absorbance
   Of PM2.5 as a marker for soot were measured at 40 sites spread
   throughout the study region. Fourteen-day samples were taken between
   March 2002 and March 2003 for each season and site. Annual average
   concentrations for the sites were determined after adjustment for
   temporal variation.
   Information on traffic counts in major roads, building densities and
   community population figures were collected in a geographical
   information system (GIs). This information was used to calculate
   different potential traffic-based predictors: (a) daily traffic flow and
   maximum traffic intensity of buffers with radii from 50 to 10000m and
   (b) distances to main roads and highways.
   NO2 concentration and PM2.5 absorbance were strongly correlated with the
   traffic-based variables. Linear regression prediction models, which
   involved predictors with radii of 50 to 1000 m, were developed for the
   Wesel region where most of the cohort members lived. They reached a
   model fit (R-2) of 0.81 and 0.65 for NO2 and PM2.5 absorbance,
   respectively. Regression models for the whole area required larger
   spatial scales and reached R-2 = 0.90 and 0.82. Comparison of predicted
   values with NO2 measurements at independent public monitoring stations
   showed a satisfactory association (r = 0.66). PM2.5 concentration,
   however, was only slightly correlated and thus poorly predictable by
   traffic-based variables (r < 0.3).
   We concluded that NO2 and soot can be considered truly traffic-related
   pollutants, and that GIS-based regression models offer a promising
   approach to assess individual levels of exposure to these pollutants.

Title = {Systematic map of determinants of buildings' energy demand and
   CO<sub>2</sub> emissions shows need for decoupling},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a major share of global final energy
   consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. An analysis of the
   worldwide observed drivers of demand can highlight the policy actions
   most suited to drive the decarbonization of the building sector. To
   contribute to such an analysis, we carry out a mapping of the literature
   on determinants of energy demand and CO2 emissions from buildings. The
   work includes a list and classification of relevant studies in an
   on-line geographical map, a description of trends and gaps, and a
   narrative review. We identify 4080 articles in the Scopus and the Web of
   Science databases, of which 712 are relevant after screening at the
   title and abstract level, and 376 are included for data extraction. The
   literature base mostly addresses electricity and water use, in North
   America and Europe (57\% of the literature) and Asia (27\%). Econometric
   modeling approaches using panel data to calculate demand elasticities,
   dominate. These findings highlight gaps in terms of the studied
   variables (only 5\% focus on CO2 emissions while a mere 1\% have a
   lifecycle perspective), geographical scope (only 5\% of the articles
   focus on Africa, 7\% on Latin America and the Caribbean, and 5\% on
   Oceania), and methodological approach (only 5\% use qualitative
   methods). We confirm that worldwide, income, energy price and outdoor
   temperature are unequivocal drivers of buildings energy demand and CO2
   emissions, followed by other indicators of scale such as population or
   heated floor area. Our analysis makes it clear that decoupling from
   rising wealth levels has not been observed. This will continue to
   challenge reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions from buildings in
   line with climate targets. Macroeconomic policies focusing on the
   impacts of income, energy price, population and growing floor area are
   needed in combination with technical policy to reduce the impact of
   outdoor climate.},

Title = {Loss estimation in Istanbul based on deterministic earthquake scenarios

Journal = {SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {699-709},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The rapid urban development in Istanbul has lead to an increase in the
   exposure levels of the urban vulnerability. Due to the steadily
   increasing population, with improper land-use planning, inappropriate
   construction techniques and inadequate infrastructure systems,
   associated with an existing high hazard level, Istanbul is one of the
   most risky cities in the Mediterranean region. Estimations of casualties
   and losses, expected for given earthquake scenarios, are necessary to
   develop sustainable rehabilitation programs and for improving
   preparedness. Deterministic hazard scenarios and time-dependent
   probabilistic hazard assessment were used as input to a GIS-based loss
   estimation model, to evaluate the earthquake risk for Istanbul.
   The deterministic ground shaking scenarios, used for loss estimation in
   Istanbul were defined in, terms of acceleration and velocity time series
   for recognized reference earthquakes caused by different rupture models
   along extended sources. The ground motions were calculated for the whole
   metropolitan area extending over a grid system of 25 x 100km(2).
   For the case of Istanbul, the representative scenario was selected by
   comparing the simulated peak values and response spectra with the
   empirical ground motion models available for the area. Simulated values
   are within one standard deviation of the empirical regressions.
   The availability of wide-ranging building inventory data allowed the
   application of a GIS-based loss estimation model (KoeriLoss-V2) to
   evaluate different loss scenarios depending on the ground shaking input,
   as well as to consider the implications of mitigation actions. It was
   found that 30\% of the buildings in the metropolitan area may be in need
   of either strengthening or demolition to achieve an adequate degree of
   life safety. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A systematic literature review of actionable alert identification
   techniques for automated static code analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {363-387},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context: Automated static analysis (ASA) identifies potential source
   code anomalies early in the software development lifecycle that could
   lead to field failures. Excessive alert generation and a large
   proportion of unimportant or incorrect alerts (unactionable alerts) may
   cause developers to reject the use of ASA. Techniques that identify
   anomalies important enough for developers to fix (actionable alerts) may
   increase the usefulness of ASA in practice.
   Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research
   results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert
   identification techniques (AAIT).
   Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic
   literature review.
   Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques
   use alert type selection; contextual information: data fusion; graph
   theory; machine learning: mathematical and statistical models; or
   dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of
   the AAITs are evaluated via an example with a variety of evaluation
   metrics.
   Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the
   premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA
   with an MIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the precision of
   the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built
   models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well
   a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted
   actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable
   alerts missed by an MIT or how well an MIT identifies unactionable
   alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and
   ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the
   current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We
   propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for
   comparison and evaluation of MIT from literature on a standard set of
   subjects and utilizing a common set of evaluation metrics. (C) 2010

Title = {Combining Trend-Based Loss with Neural Network for Air Quality

Journal = {CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects things in a special
   union. It embeds a physical entity through an intelligent perception
   system to obtain information about the component at any time. It
   connects various objects. IoT has the ability of information
   transmission, information perception, and information processing. The
   air quality forecasting has always been an urgent problem, which affects
   people's quality of life seriously. So far, many air quality prediction
   algorithms have been proposed, which can be mainly classified into two
   categories. One is regression-based prediction, the other is deep
   learning-based prediction. Regression-based prediction is aimed to make
   use of the classical regression algorithm and the various supervised
   meteorological characteristics to regress the meteorological value. Deep
   learning methods usually use convolutional neural networks (CNN) or
   recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict the meteorological value. As
   an excellent feature extractor, CNN has achieved good performance in
   many scenes. In the same way, as an efficient network for orderly data
   processing, RNN has also achieved good results. However, few or none of
   the above methods can meet the current accuracy requirements on
   prediction. Moreover, there is no way to pay attention to the trend
   monitoring of air quality data. For the sake of accurate results, this
   paper proposes a novel predicted-trend-based loss function (PTB), which
   is used to replace the loss function in RNN. At the same time, the trend
   of change and the predicted value are constrained to obtain more
   accurate prediction results of PM2.5. In addition, this paper extends
   the model scenario to the prediction of the whole existing training data
   features. All the data on the next day of the model is mixed labels,
   which effectively realizes the prediction of all features. The
   experiments show that the loss function proposed in this paper is
   effective.},

Title = {Aberrant development of intrinsic brain activity in a rat model of
   caregiver maltreatment of offspring},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {Caregiver maltreatment induces vulnerability to later-life
   psychopathology. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggest changes in
   prefrontal and limbic circuitry underlie this susceptibility. We
   examined this question using a rat model of maternal maltreatment and
   methods translated from humans, resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (R-fMRI). Rat pups were reared by mothers provided
   with insufficient or abundant bedding for nest building from postnatal
   (PN) days 8 to 12 and underwent behavioral assessments of affect-related
   behaviors (forced swim, sucrose preference and social interaction) in
   adolescence (PN45) and early adulthood (PN60). R-fMRI sessions were
   conducted under light anesthesia at both ages. Offspring reared with
   insufficient bedding (that is, maltreated) displayed enduring negative
   affective behaviors. Amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional
   connectivity increased significantly from adolescence to adulthood in
   controls, but not in maltreated animals. We computed the fractional
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), an index of intrinsic
   brain activity, and found that fALFF in medial prefrontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate cortex (MPFC/ACC) increased significantly with age in
   controls but remained unchanged in maltreated animals during adolescence
   and adulthood. We used a seed-based analysis to explore changes in
   functional connectivity between this region and the whole brain.
   Compared with controls, maltreated animals demonstrated reduced
   functional connectivity between MPFC/ACC and left caudate/putamen across
   both ages. Functional connectivity between MPFC/ACC and right
   caudate/putamen showed a group by age interaction: decreased in controls
   but increased in maltreated animals. These data suggest that
   maltreatment induces vulnerability to psychopathology and is associated
   with differential developmental trajectories of prefrontal and
   subcortical circuits underlying affect regulation.},

Title = {Using network motifs to characterize temporal network evolution leading
   to diffusion inhibition},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Network motifs are patterns of over-represented node interactions in a
   network which have been previously used as building blocks to understand
   various aspects of the social networks. In this paper, we use motif
   patterns to characterize the information diffusion process in social
   networks. We study the lifecycle of information cascades to understand
   what leads to saturation of growth in terms of cascade reshares, thereby
   resulting in expiration, an event we call ``diffusion inhibition{''}. In
   an attempt to understand what causes inhibition, we use motifs to
   dissect the network obtained from information cascades coupled with
   traces of historical diffusion or social network links. Our main results
   follow from experiments on a dataset of cascades from the Weibo platform
   and the Flixster movie ratings. We observe the temporal counts of 5-node
   undirected motifs from the cascade temporal networks leading to the
   inhibition stage. Empirical evidences from the analysis lead us to
   conclude the following about stages preceding inhibition: (1)
   individuals tend to adopt information more from users they have known in
   the past through social networks or previous interactions thereby
   creating patterns containing triads more frequently than acyclic
   patterns with linear chains and (2) users need multiple exposures or
   rounds of social reinforcement for them to adopt an information and as a
   result information starts spreading slowly thereby leading to the death
   of the cascade. Following these observations, we use motif-based
   features to predict the edge cardinality of the network exhibited at the
   time of inhibition. We test features of motif patterns using regression
   models for both individual patterns and their combination and we find
   that motifs as features are better predictors of the future network
   organization than individual node centralities.},

Abstract = {The coupling beams couple two or more RC walls in series, and transfer
   vertical forces between adjacent walls to resist a portion of total
   overturning moments. However, the RC beams may suffer brittle shear
   failure in earthquakes, which poses a risk to the life safety. In
   addition, the damaged RC coupling beams are difficult to repair and may
   render the whole building irreparable. To mitigate these problems, the
   frictional steel truss coupling beams (FTCBs) was proposed. The FTCBs
   concentrate inelastic deformation into the replaceable friction dampers
   while the main body remains elastic. Compared to metallic dampers, the
   friction dampers are anticipated to be low-damage and can be rapidly
   repaired by retightening or replacing the bolts after a major
   earthquake. The limiting shear strength of FTCBs relies merely on the
   stable sliding strength of friction dampers while the initial stiffness
   is determined by the truss members. The strength and stiffness can thus
   be separately designed for FTCBs, which offers great design flexibility.
   To support the seismic design of coupled wall or dual systems
   incorporating FTCBs, the hysteretic model of FTCBs was proposed. The
   model consists of a trilinear backbone curve and the unloading and
   reverse loading rules. The model has eight control parameters. The
   initial stiffness and limiting shear strength are defined by theoretical
   formulae and the others are derived through regression analysis on test
   results. The hysteretic model fitted well with both test and FE results,
   indicating its applicability to FTCBs with varying core design
   parameters.},

Title = {NetEye: a user-centered wireless sensor network testbed for
   high-fidelity, robust experimentation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Experimentation infrastructures for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have
   been widely adopted over the past decade for high-fidelity validation
   and rapid prototyping of applications and for discovering and modeling
   phenomena that have led to improvements in analysis and simulation
   capabilities. Nonetheless, the community is still looking for more
   heterogeneous WSN testbeds for purposes such as federation, experiment
   regression analysis, and improved testbed availability. In addition,
   most existing WSN testbeds lack robustness and predictability in the
   presence of failures, and they do not provide user-friendly support for
   scientific experimentation (e.g., quick repetition of experiments). We
   develop the NetEye testbed as a high-fidelity, robust WSN
   experimentation infrastructure that provides the ease of scientific
   experimentation. Consisting of 130 TelosB motes with IEEE 802.15.4
   radios and 15 Linux laptops with IEEE 802.11a/b/g radios, NetEye
   provides a WSN deployment that enables high-fidelity experimentation
   with single-hop as well as multihop WSN networking, and the lab-scale
   deployment mimics network properties of building-scale and outdoor WSN
   deployments. Building upon the authors experience in developing and
   using WSN testbeds in the past years, NetEye also has enhanced features
   that enables easy, robust scientific experimentation. In particular,
   NetEye provides users with a simple, powerful web portal, which
   streamlines users experience in the whole lifecycle of scientific
   experimentation (e.g., experiment scheduling, status monitoring, and
   data exfiltration). NetEye employs a stable, fault-tolerant state
   machine to improve the robustness of the testbed in the presence of
   failures. NetEye also develops a health monitoring service NetEye Doctor
   that monitors hardware and software status; the real-time health
   monitoring information about the testbed is seamlessly integrated with
   the lifecycle of experiment scheduling, experiment status monitoring,
   and experiment data analysis for both robust experimentation and for
   informed experiment analysis. To address the log-data congestion problem
   in long-running, large scale experiments, NetEye employs a TDMA (Time
   Division Multiple Access) mechanism to ensure reliability in
   exfiltrating experiment data to users. To facilitate quick, repetitive
   scientific experimentation, NetEye also speeds up the mote programming
   cycle through fast job status transition and multi-thread-based mote
   programming. NetEye has been successfully running for over 3.5?years,
   and it has been integrated with the federated WSN experimental
   infrastructure KanseiGenie. NetEye is widely used by researchers from
   USA and Asia, and more than 10 experiments are executed through NetEye
   per day on average. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Roles of artificial intelligence in construction engineering and
   management: A critical review and future trends},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI),
   construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid
   digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the
   current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In
   this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both
   scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of
   AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research
   trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore
   the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473
   journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been
   an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along
   with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building
   information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief
   understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the
   emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high
   efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have
   been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in
   CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2)
   information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language
   processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The
   goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a
   data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex
   project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key
   directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual
   and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things
   (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to
   constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.},

Title = {Brain tumour segmentation with incomplete imaging data},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Brain tumour segmentation models with incomplete sets of MRI
   sequences-common in clinical practice-still delineate lesions well and
   even identify enhancing tumour without post-contrast imaging. The
   observed marginal benefits of additional MR sequences-especially
   contrast-enhanced-suggest that the costs and risks of imaging ordinarily
   sufficient to permit high-definition quantitative analysis may be
   reducible.
   Progress in neuro-oncology is increasingly recognized to be obstructed
   by the marked heterogeneity-genetic, pathological, and clinical-of brain
   tumours. If the treatment susceptibilities and outcomes of individual
   patients differ widely, determined by the interactions of many
   multimodal characteristics, then large-scale, fully-inclusive, richly
   phenotyped data-including imaging-will be needed to predict them at the
   individual level. Such data can realistically be acquired only in the
   routine clinical stream, where its quality is inevitably degraded by the
   constraints of real-world clinical care. Although contemporary machine
   learning could theoretically provide a solution to this task, especially
   in the domain of imaging, its ability to cope with realistic,
   incomplete, low-quality data is yet to be determined. In the largest and
   most comprehensive study of its kind, applying state-of-the-art brain
   tumour segmentation models to large scale, multi-site MRI data of 1251
   individuals, here we quantify the comparative fidelity of automated
   segmentation models drawn from MR data replicating the various levels of
   completeness observed in real life. We demonstrate that models trained
   on incomplete data can segment lesions very well, often equivalently to
   those trained on the full completement of images, exhibiting Dice
   coefficients of 0.907 (single sequence) to 0.945 (complete set) for
   whole tumours and 0.701 (single sequence) to 0.891 (complete set) for
   component tissue types. This finding opens the door both to the
   application of segmentation models to large-scale historical data, for
   the purpose of building treatment and outcome predictive models, and
   their application to real-world clinical care. We further ascertain that
   segmentation models can accurately detect enhancing tumour in the
   absence of contrast-enhancing imaging, quantifying the burden of
   enhancing tumour with an R-2 > 0.97, varying negligibly with lesion
   morphology. Such models can quantify enhancing tumour without the
   administration of intravenous contrast, inviting a revision of the
   notion of tumour enhancement if the same information can be extracted
   without contrast-enhanced imaging. Our analysis includes validation on a
   heterogeneous, real-world 50 patient sample of brain tumour imaging
   acquired over the last 15 years at our tertiary centre, demonstrating
   maintained accuracy even on non-isotropic MRI acquisitions, or even on
   complex post-operative imaging with tumour recurrence. This work
   substantially extends the translational opportunity for quantitative
   analysis to clinical situations where the full complement of sequences
   is not available and potentially enables the characterization of
   contrast-enhanced regions where contrast administration is infeasible or
   undesirable.},

Title = {Identifying Risk Indicators for Natural Hazard-Related Power Outages as
   a Component of Risk Assessment: An Analysis Using Power Outage Data from
   Hurricane Irma},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Extensive use has been made of lifecycle-cost assessment to enhance the
   cost-effectiveness and resilience of facilities management. However, if
   such assessments are to be truly effective, supplemental information
   will be needed on the major costs to be expected over buildings' entire
   lives. Electricity generation and distribution systems, for example, are
   absolutely indispensable to industry and human society, not least in the
   operation of buildings and other infrastructure as networks. The
   widespread disruption that ensues when such power systems are damaged
   often carries considerable repair costs. Natural disasters likewise can
   cause extensive societal, economic, and environmental damage. Such
   damage is often associated with lengthy power outages that, as well as
   being directly harmful, can hinder emergency response and recovery.
   Accordingly, the present study investigated the correlations of natural
   hazard indicators such as wind speed and rainfall, along with
   environmental data regarding the power failure in Florida caused by
   Hurricane Irma in 2017 utilizing multiple regression analysis. The
   environmental data in question, selected on the basis of a thorough
   literature review, was tree density. Our analysis indicated that the
   independent variables, maximum wind speed, total rainfall, and tree
   density, were all significantly correlated with the dependent variable,
   power failure. Among these, rainfall was the least significant. Despite
   there being only three independent variables in the model, its adjusted
   coefficient of determination (0.512) indicated its effectiveness as a
   predictor of the power outages caused by Hurricane Irma. As such, our
   results can serve the construction industry's establishment of advanced
   safety guidelines and structural designs power transmission systems in
   regions at risk of hurricanes and typhoons. Additionally, insurance
   companies' loss-assessment modeling for power-system facilities would
   benefit from incorporating the three identified risk indicators.
   Finally, our findings can serve as a useful reference to policymakers
   tasked with mitigating power outages' effects on infrastructure in
   hurricane-prone areas. It is hoped that this work will be extended,
   facilitating infrastructure restoration planning and making societies
   and economies more sustainable.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Coagulation monitoring capabilities during transport are
   limited. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole-blood clotting test
   measuring clot formation, stabilization, and fibrinolysis and is
   traditionally performed in a laboratory. We evaluated a new
   point-of-care TEG analyzer, TEG 6s (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA), in a
   large animal model of combat-relevant trauma managed with extracorporeal
   life support during ground and high-altitude aeromedical evacuation. The
   objective was to compare TEG 6s used during transport versus the
   predicate device, TEG 5000, used in the laboratory. We hypothesized that
   TEG 6s would be comparable with TEG 5000 during dynamically changing
   transport conditions.
   METHODS Thromboelastography parameters (R, K, angle, MA, LY30) derived
   by TEG 6s and TEG 5000 were compared during transport of 8 swine. TEG 6s
   was transported with animals during ground transport and flight. TEG
   5000 was stationary in an adjacent building. TEG 6s activated clotting
   time (ACT) was compared with a Hemochron Junior ACT analyzer (Accriva
   Diagnostics, San Diego, CA). Statistics were performed using SAS 9.4
   with Deming regressions, Spearman correlations, and average differences
   compared.
   RESULTS Correlation between devices was stronger at sea-level (R, r =
   0.7413; K, r = 0.7115; angle, r = 0.7192; MA, r = 0.8386; LY30, r =
   0.9099) than during high-altitude transport (R, r = 0.4787; K, r =
   0.4007; angle, r = 0.3706; MA, r = 0.6573; LY30, r = 0.8481). Method
   agreement was comparable during stationary operation (R, r = 0.7978; K,
   r = 0.7974; angle, r = 0.7574; MA, r = 0.7841; LY30, r = 0.9140) versus
   ground transport (R, r = 0.7927; K, r = 0.6246; angle, r = 0.6967; MA, r
   = 0.9163; LY30, r = 0.8603). TEG 6s ACT trended higher than Hemochron
   ACT when subjects were heparinized (average difference, 1,442 1,703
   seconds) without a methodological difference by Deming regression.
   CONCLUSION Mobile TEG 6s during ground and altitude transport is
   feasible and provides unprecedented information to guide coagulation
   management. Future studies should assess the precision and accuracy of
   TEG 6s during transport of critically ill.},

Abstract = {Marketing performance measurement is important in retail companies, it
   is critical for the budget planning and adjustment of marketing
   strategies and tactics over time. Compared to digital online marketing,
   such as social media advertisers where tagging techniques {[}1] can be
   applied to track the lifecycle of the consumption and the customer's
   behaviours, traditional TV and radio advertising will be harder to
   evaluate at the individual level. Instead, common approach in this
   scenario is to study the relationship between ads spend and sales. This
   paper presents a casual inference methodology - ``Difference in
   Differences{''}(DID) on the application of TV marketing measurement.
   Instead of building direct relationship between ads and sales, we
   attempt to create an experimental research design and study the
   differential effect on a `treatment group' versus a `control group'. In
   order to study the performance of advertising in a city, the treatment
   group is sales performance during and after TV advertisings and the
   control group is the statistical model that mimics the sales of the same
   city without ads influence. It is proved that the model can
   significantly predict the sales of city in nature by considering its
   past sales, the neighbourhood districts and weather conditions. And a
   case study in industrial data shows that DID methodology can effectively
   evaluate the TV advertising results on regions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {The human-centric philosophy is considered a crucial development
   direction for smart Product-Service Systems (smart PSS). Smart PSS has
   effectively advanced the circular economy by enhancing user experience,
   incorporating servitization and digital servitization, and extending
   product lifecycle, among other key aspects of sustainable development.
   However, there is currently a lack of a reasonable, accurate, and
   actionable framework and methodology to express the human element,
   namely user profiling, within this philosophy. To address this gap, this
   paper utilizes statistical methods such as factor analysis, cluster
   analysis, and regression analysis, building upon the concept of
   traditional user profiling. The aim is to integrate the three prominent
   approaches of goal-oriented, scenario-based, and data-driven user
   profiling, with the goal of complementing each other and designing a
   top-level user profiling framework for smart PSS. Furthermore, Industry
   4.0 technologies and text mining techniques are employed to collect data
   on users ` product and service usage. As these data contain realtime
   information about user needs, behaviors and goals at different time
   periods, they can be used to construct dynamic features of user
   profiling, and ultimately achieve the construction of dynamic user
   profiling for smart PSS. To validate the proposed user profiling
   framework and dynamic user features of smart PSS, this paper presents a
   case study focusing on the user group of maternal women. This case study
   promotes the in-depth exploration of smart PSS research in expressing
   the human element.},

Title = {Practical considerations in deploying statistical methods for defect
   prediction: A case study within the Turkish telecommunications industry},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},

   ICSE, Vancouver, CANADA, 2009},
Abstract = {Context: Building defect prediction models in large organizations has
   many challenges due to limited resources and tight schedules in the
   software development lifecycle. It is not easy to collect data, utilize
   any type of algorithm and build a permanent model at once. We have
   conducted a study in a large telecommunications company in Turkey to
   employ a software measurement program and to predict pre-release
   defects. Based on our prior publication, we have shared our experience
   in terms of the project steps (i.e. challenges and opportunities). We
   have further introduced new techniques that improve our earlier results.
   Objective: In our previous work, we have built similar predictors using
   data representative for US software development. Our task here was to
   check if those predictors were specific solely to US organizations or to
   a broader class of software.
   Method: We have presented our approach and results in the form of an
   experience report. Specifically, we have made use of different
   techniques for improving the information content of the software data
   and the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier in the prediction model
   that is locally tuned for the company. We have increased the information
   content of the software data by using module dependency data and
   improved the performance by adjusting the hyper-parameter (decision
   threshold) of the Naive Bayes classifier. We have reported and discussed
   our results in terms of defect detection rates and false alarms. We also
   carried out a cost-benefit analysis to show that our approach can be
   efficiently put into practice.
   Results: Our general result is that general defect predictors, which
   exist across a wide range of software (in both US and Turkish
   organizations), are present. Our specific results indicate that
   concerning the organization subject to this study, the use of version
   history information along with code metrics decreased false alarms by
   22\%, the use of dependencies between modules further reduced false
   alarms by 8\%, and the decision threshold optimization for the Naive
   Bayes classifier using code metrics and version history information
   further improved false alarms by 30\% in comparison to a prediction
   using only code metrics and a default decision threshold.
   Conclusion: Implementing statistical techniques and machine learning on
   a real life scenario is a difficult yet possible task. Using simple
   statistical and algorithmic techniques produces an average detection
   rate of 88\%. Although using dependency data improves our results, it is
   difficult to collect and analyze such data in general. Therefore, we
   would recommend optimizing the hyper-parameter of the proposed
   technique, Naive Bayes, to calibrate the defect prediction model rather
   than employing more complex classifiers. We also recommend that
   researchers who explore statistical and algorithmic methods for defect
   prediction should spend less time on their algorithms and more time on
   studying the pragmatic considerations of large organizations. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Background Exposure to indoor moisture damage and visible mold has been
   found to be associated with asthma and respiratory symptoms in several
   questionnaire-based studies by self-report. We aimed to define the
   prospective association between the early life exposure to residential
   moisture damage or mold and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and
   lung function parameters as objective markers for airway inflammation
   and asthma in 6-year-old children.
   Methods Home inspections were performed in children's homes when infants
   were on average 5 months old. At age 6 years, data on FeNO (n = 322) as
   well as lung function (n = 216) measurements were collected. Logistic
   regression and generalized additive models were used for statistical
   analyses.
   Results Early age major moisture damage and moisture damage or mold in
   the child's main living areas were significantly associated with
   increased FeNO levels (>75th percentile) at the age of 6 years (adjusted
   odds ratios, 95\% confidence intervals, aOR (95\% CI): 3.10 (1.35-7.07)
   and 3.16 (1.43-6.98), respectively. Effects were more pronounced in
   those who did not change residential address throughout the study
   period. For lung function, major structural damage within the whole home
   was associated with reduced FEV1 and FVC, but not with FEV1/FVC. No
   association with lung function was observed with early moisture damage
   or mold in the child's main living areas.
   Conclusion These results underline the importance of prevention and
   remediation efforts of moisture and mold-damaged buildings in order to
   avoid harmful effects within the vulnerable phase of the infants and
   children's immunologic development.},

Title = {HEXACO personality factors as predictors of physical activity, resting

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Personality traits are known factors that may influence
   levels of physical activity and other healthy lifestyle measures and
   behaviors that ultimately lead to health problems later in life.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The aim of this study was to examine the
   association between personality traits (HEXACO) and levels of physical
   activity and resting heart rate (RHR) - measured using Fitbits, BMI, and
   a self -reported whole -person healthy lifestyle score for N = 2580
   college students. Data were collected and analyzed for students enrolled
   in a University Success type course from August 2017 to May 2021. The
   relationships between HEXACO personality traits and various physical
   activity and healthy lifestyle behaviors were analyzed by building
   several multiple regression models using R version 4.0.2. RESULTS In
   general, students who are extraverted were more physically active and
   students who are more open to experience had a higher RHR, even when
   controlling for gender. Females and males however had different profiles
   as to how personality influenced physical activity and other health
   -related measures. Male extraverts with high negative emotionality
   scores tend to be more physically active, whereas females tend to be
   more physically active when they were high in extroversion and
   conscientiousness, and low in openness to experience. BMI values were
   higher for female participants with high honesty -humility and low
   agreeableness and conscientiousness scores. Females also had a lower RHR
   for high honesty -humility and emotionality and low conscientiousness
   scores. CONCLUSIONS Personality can influence levels of physical
   activity, RHR, and BMI. This is especially true of women. Being aware of
   one's personality and the relationship of personality traits to levels
   of physical activity and other measures of leading a healthy lifestyle
   can be beneficial in determining strategies to improve long-term health
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background People who were disabled from working reported substantially
   worse depression in recent research {[}1] despite adjustment for
   demographic covariates, cognitive-appraisal processes, and
   COVID-specific stressors, thus motivating the present work. Objective
   This study sought to ``drill down{''} to understand employment-group
   differences (employed, retired, unemployed, disabled) in cognitive
   factors, and how these factors played into paths to depression during
   COVID early in the pandemic and depression trajectories over 15.5 months
   of follow-up. Methods This longitudinal cohort study (n = 771) included
   chronically ill and general-population samples in the United States,
   characterized into the same depression-trajectory groups as the earlier
   study {[}1]. The Quality-of-Life Appraisal Profilev2 Short-Form assessed
   cognitive-appraisal processes. COVID-specific scales assessed hardship,
   worry, and social support. Chi-square, Analysis of Variance,
   classification and regression tree, and random effects modeling
   investigated factors associated with reported depression over time
   specifically by employment group, rather than in the whole sample which
   was the focus of the earlier study. Results Disabled participants were
   disproportionately represented in the stably depressed trajectory group,
   reporting more hardship and worry, and lower social support than
   employed and retired participants (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to
   focus on health goals, problem goals, and emphasizing the negative (p <
   0.001). They had different paths and cut-points to depression than
   employed/unemployed/retired participants. Even mild endorsement of
   emphasizing the negative and recent changes predicted higher depression.
   COVID-specific stressors and cognitive-appraisal processes were less
   implicated in depression among disabled participants compared to others.
   Conclusions Disabled participants were at greater risk of stable
   depression during the COVID pandemic. Small increases in emphasizing the
   negative were a path to worse depression, and disabled participants'
   depression may be less reactive to external circumstances or ways of
   thinking.},

Title = {Spatial-Temporal Characteristics and Driving Factors of the Coupling

Abstract = {Promoting the coordinated development of population health and the
   economy is an important part of building a ``Healthy China{''} and
   promoting high-quality economic development. Based on the systematic
   construction of the population health and economic development
   evaluation index system, this paper uses the coupled coordination model,
   geodetector, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to
   comprehensively measure the population health level and economic
   development level at the provincial scale in China in 2000 and 2015, and
   reveals the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the
   coupled coordination relationship between the population health level
   and economic development level at the provincial scale in China from
   2000 to 2015 and its driving factors. The results show the following:
   (1) China's population health and economic development are in a
   high-level coupling stage, and the coupling level increases slightly
   with time; spatially, two types of running-in coupling and high-level
   coupling coexist; the coupling degree in the eastern and central regions
   tends to increase, while the coupling degree in the western region tends
   to weaken. (2) China's population health and economic development are in
   a good coupling coordination stage as a whole, and the coupling
   coordination degree has an increasing trend; spatially, the coupling
   coordination degree shows high spatial differentiation characteristics
   in the east and low in the west; the good and high-quality coupling
   coordination type area tends to expand to the west, while the moderate
   coupling coordination type area tends to shrink to the west; there is
   also positive spatial agglomeration of coupling coordination degree, and
   the spatial agglomeration is gradually enhanced. (3) The coupling
   coordination of China's population health and economic development is
   driven by multiple factors such as natural conditions, health resources,
   culture quality, and urbanization level; the interaction between factors
   is stronger than that of a single factor, and the driving effect of each
   factor also shows significant spatial heterogeneity. This study is
   intended to provide a scientific basis for promoting harmonious
   population health and economic development.},

Title = {Long non-coding RNA <i>TUG1</i> is downregulated in Friedreich's ataxia},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by reduced
   frataxin levels. It leads to motor and sensory impairments and has a
   median life expectancy of around 35 years. As the most common inherited
   form of ataxia, Friedreich's ataxia lacks reliable, non-invasive
   biomarkers, prolonging and inflating the cost of clinical trials. This
   study proposes TUG1, a long non-coding RNA, as a promising blood-based
   biomarker for Friedreich's ataxia, which is known to regulate various
   cellular processes. In a previous study using a frataxin knockdown mouse
   model, we observed several hallmark Friedreich's ataxia symptoms.
   Building on this, we hypothesized that a dual-source approach-comparing
   the data from peripheral blood samples from Friedreich's ataxia patients
   with tissue samples from affected areas in Friedreich's ataxia knockdown
   mice, tissues usually unattainable from patients-would effectively
   identify robust biomarkers. A comprehensive reanalysis was conducted on
   gene expression data from 183 age- and sex-matched peripheral blood
   samples of Friedreich's ataxia patients, carriers and controls and 192
   tissue data sets from Friedreich's ataxia knockdown mice. Blood and
   tissue samples underwent RNA isolation and quantitative reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction, and frataxin knockdown was
   confirmed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Tug1 RNA
   interaction was explored via RNA pull-down assays. Validation was
   performed in serum samples on an independent set of 45 controls and 45
   Friedreich's ataxia patients and in blood samples from 66 heterozygous
   carriers and 72 Friedreich's ataxia patients. Tug1 and Slc40a1 emerged
   as potential blood-based biomarkers, confirmed in the Friedreich's
   ataxia knockdown mouse model (one-way ANOVA, P <= 0.05). Tug1 was
   consistently downregulated after Fxn knockdown and correlated strongly
   with Fxn levels (R-2 = 0.71 during depletion, R-2 = 0.74 during rescue).
   Slc40a1 showed a similar but tissue-specific pattern. Further validation
   of Tug1's downstream targets strengthened its biomarker candidacy. In
   additional human samples, TUG1 levels were significantly downregulated
   in both whole blood and serum of Friedreich's ataxia patients compared
   with controls (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.05). Regression analyses
   revealed a negative correlation between TUG1 fold-change and disease
   onset (P < 0.0037) and positive correlations with disease duration and
   functional disability stage score (P < 0.04). This suggests that
   elevated TUG1 levels correlate with earlier onset and more severe cases.
   This study identifies TUG1 as a potential blood-based biomarker for
   Friedreich's ataxia, showing consistent expression variance in human and
   mouse tissues related to disease severity and key Friedreich's ataxia
   pathways. It correlates with frataxin levels, indicating its promise as
   an early, non-invasive marker. TUG1 holds potential for Friedreich's
   ataxia monitoring and therapeutic development, meriting additional
   research.},
