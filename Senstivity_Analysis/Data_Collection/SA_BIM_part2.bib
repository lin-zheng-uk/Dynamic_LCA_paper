Title = {Improving FM task efficiency through BIM: a proposal for BIM
   implementation},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the presented research is to investigate which
   tasks among the ones performed during a buildings' operational phase are
   perceived to be more inefficient and to investigate if the information
   within a building information model (BIM) can help improve task
   efficiency.
   Design/methodology/approach The Digital Built Britain (BIM Level 3) aims
   to extend BIM into operation by promoting a life cycle approach for
   buildings through an integrated digital environment. Nevertheless, the
   main focus of both BIM Level 2 and Level 3 is mainly on design,
   construction and hand over; therefore, the current understanding and use
   of BIM for a buildings' occupancy phase is still limited. Current
   literature and research focusing on BIM and building management show
   only marginal use of the technology, especially in terms of how BIM can
   be used beside for maintenance.
   Findings The paper presents the results of an online questionnaire
   survey aimed to ascertain the level of perceived inefficiencies of
   operational tasks. Through the analysis of Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFC) data models, the research identifies the data set needed to
   improve the efficiency of the tasks and presents a structured
   implementation plan to identify the information that should be
   prioritized in the model implementation.
   Originality/value The study presents part of a methodology developed by
   the author aimed to implement a BIM model for existing buildings
   including information that would support the management of the single
   facility/portfolio. While other studies have considered BIM and the
   operational phase, especially in relation to asset maintenance, this
   study has focused on understanding how the information included in the
   model can improve task efficiency.},

Abstract = {The energy sector is always facing huge challenges specially in
   countries with highly inflated population where the building sector has
   more pressure to reduce energy consumption. To achieve more energy
   efficiency in residential buildings with lower life cycle cost (LCC) and
   enhanced thermal comfort conditions, this study develops a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm model for the three major climates in
   Egypt (Mediterranean, semi-arid and arid). The design variables
   considered include external wall type, roof type, window to wall ratio
   (WWR), building orientation, HVAC system setpoint and HVAC operation
   schedule. Available sustainable materials in Egypt are considered for
   building envelope alternatives, such as limestone and polyurethane
   expanded. The main findings from the study approved that the optimum
   solutions in all climates have successfully balanced the reduction in
   energy consumption and LCC. However, the discomfort hours in both
   Mediterranean and Semi-arid climates have less reduction percentages
   compared to the arid climate.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with an ongoing research activity for developing a
   Building Information Model (BIM) for the facility and collections
   management of museums. The BIM success lies not only in its application
   for the design and construction of buildings but also because it helps
   the information management of a building throughout its life cycle.
   Compared to other activities, in museums management, the
   container/content relationship is essential for the preventive
   conservation of artworks, according to national and international
   guidelines. Then, an effective BIM-based museum information system
   linked to external databases (called M-BIM) should include also the art
   collections for managing information regarding both the building and
   artworks by 3D objects handling. This facilitates the management of the
   procedures prescribed by international best practices (as the facility
   and conservation reports set up for the loan of artworks) or by Italian
   regulations (as to check the compliance of a museum with the minimum
   standards or to archive renovations and temporary exhibitions). The
   proposed methodology has been tested on the Galleria dell'Accademia di
   Firenze (Florence, Italy), situated in a complex heritage building.
   Starting from data acquired during a laser scanner survey carried out in
   2011, a HBIM of the whole building has been created. Then, the
   sculptures and paintings of a consistent part of the museum have been
   modelled with different approaches and inserted as BIM objects. Artworks
   instances include 3D geometry and physical data (dimensions, materials,
   weight, etc.), other data are obtained from links to already existing
   external catalogues. A database conceptual model has been formalised,
   according to INSPIRE Consolidated Unified Modelling Language (UML) of
   the INSPIRE Directive, with the aim to maintain the independence of the
   BIM approach but improving data connection with other databases and
   sources.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In order to better play the role of information technology in the
   construction management of rail transit projects, we analyze the
   application of geographic information system (GIS) + building
   information modeling (BIM) technology in the construction management of
   rail transit projects by combining the characteristics of GIS+BIM
   technology and aiming at the overall improvement of project management
   efficiency and technical management methods. This study is mainly
   conducted with the support of BIM technology and sensing technology. In
   the design stage, carbon emissions are classified according to the
   source activities of building carbon emissions, and the carbon emissions
   in the building life cycle are quickly calculated by using BIM
   technology, and the design is optimized according to the analysis of the
   budget results. The experimental results prove that the low-carbon
   building evaluation standard cloud model of allelectronic computer
   interlocking system for urban rail transit established in this study,
   combined with the comprehensive weighting results, calculates the
   low-carbon index cloud model and comprehensive cloud model, and derives
   the operational safety risk level of the all-electronic computer
   interlocking system, and the model optimization effect is good. Practice
   shows that GIS+BIM technology can realize the refinement and
   informatization of construction management, and has a broad development
   space in the field of urban rail transit and urban underground space

Abstract = {The life cycle of a building is assumed to be 80 years. A number of
   factors influence the selection of building materials and components
   including cost, design, performance, and availability. Sustainable
   design seeks to minimize environmental health impacts caused by building
   materials. A healthy workplace or living space supports the occupants'
   health and well-being. As an important aspect of the life cycle
   assessment you have to consider what is needed to improve the indoor air
   quality (IAQ). A mathematical model allows to predict the future indoor
   air quality during the design phase. Based on this model, a tool was
   developed that architects and other consultants can make use of to
   optimize the construction and surfaces during the design phase. This
   calculation tool will be part of MINERGIE-ECOplus, a Swiss
   sustainability evaluation method. MINERGIE is a building label for
   ecological design, high energy efficiency, and comfort. The existing
   energy simulation software (LESOSAI) will be further improved by tools
   for IAQ and ecobalance calculation.
   The indoor air quality criteria can be evaluated quantitatively.
   Therefore the emission data of building materials for VOC, formaldehyd,
   and other substances are collected in a catalogue of materials. Further
   information is necessary, like, for example, room capacity, air change
   rate, quantity and consistence of surface materials. In order to
   evaluate data and make predictions regarding future indoor air quality,
   reference values have to be taken into account. By this process, a
   classification system ranging from `very good' to `bad' quality becomes
   possible.},

Abstract = {In this paper, to conduct an in-depth study on the green construction of
   coastal prefabricated assembly buildings, we use BIM technology
   application in which we can realize the fine production of prefabricated
   assembly buildings and improve the quality of finished products. In
   addition, BIM technology makes the design efficiency improved from the
   whole design whole life cycle. Again, the application of BIM technology
   to prefabricated assembly building design can optimize collaborative
   design, component deepening, schematic design, and pre-planning.
   Designers can use BIM modeling software to build a model and import it
   into environmental simulation software so that designers can analyze the
   environment of the model in the pre-design stage. BIM model can also be
   used for inter-professional collision checking and visual collaboration.
   We have taken measures in five areas: conservation, material and
   material resources utilization, water and water resources utilization,
   energy conservation and energy utilization, and land and land resources
   conservation. A series of management systems including pre-planning,
   process implementation, performance evaluation, and application
   promotion has been established and research results have been obtained.
   The project has passed the evaluation of ``the fifth batch of national
   green construction demonstration projects{''} and has achieved good
   social and economic benefits. It is proved that the research results of
   green construction management of this project have reference
   significance for the green construction management of other construction

Title = {Optimising the material emissions of single-dwelling residential
   buildings using the dynamic life cycle iteration protocols},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While developed countries progress in environmental impact mitigation,
   developing economies struggle to lessen the severity of environmental
   impact and improve performance strategies. As of 2021, only 199 research
   publications were linked to African Life Cycle Assessment investigations
   highlighting the environmental consequences and lack of research in
   developing countries. In 2022 Ghana's global environmental performance
   was ranked 170th out of 180 countries, with a score of 27.70 out of 100,
   showing a ten-year trend of-6.1. This study aimed to optimise single
   dwelling residential buildings' material emissions from cradle to gate
   using first principles through the dynamic life cycle iteration
   protocols. The following objectives were set: 1) to identify the primary
   materials in a typical Ghanaian single-family dwelling and apply first
   principles to model the environmental impact, and 2) to replace the
   materials with an environmentally friendly type through iteration
   optimisation. The Building Information Modelling in Revit 2021 was used
   to design and take off quantities of the materials. The optimisation was
   conducted through iterations using MS Excel. The baseline model showed
   that steel and aluminium products generated frontal results of 28.64 ton
   CO2eq/m2 and 1.96 ton CO2eq/m2, representing 92\% and 6\% of the total
   GWP100, respectively. A decrease of 39\% in GWP100 emissions was made
   possible by employing concrete blocks instead of expandable lightweight
   concrete clay blocks. It is noteworthy that gypsum plasterboard had the
   lowest material impact across the GWP100, emitting 1895.40 kgCO2eq/m2,
   or 0.81 percent carbon, during the production phase. The results of this
   study can aid the many real estate developers and construction firms in
   developing nations who want to build residential homes using sustainable
   materials to lessen the effects of climate change caused by using
   building materials.},

   Construction (AEC) project, the BIM (Building Information
   Model/Modeling) becomes increasingly large. This condition will cause
   users difficulty in acquiring the information they truly desire on a
   mobile device with limited space for interaction. The situation will be
   even worse for personnel without extensive knowledge of Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) or for nonexperts of the BIM software. To
   improve the value of the big data of BIM, an approach to intelligent
   data retrieval and representation for cloud BIM applications based on
   natural language processing was proposed. First, strategies for data
   storage and query acceleration based on the popular cloud-based database
   were explored to handle the large amount of BIM data. Then, the concepts
   ``keyword{''} and ``constraint{''} were proposed to capture the key
   objects and their specifications in a natural-language-based sentence
   that expresses the requirements of the user. Keywords and constraints
   can be mapped to IFC entities or properties through the International
   Framework for Dictionaries (IFD). The relationship between the user's
   requirement and the IFC-based data model was established by path finding
   in a graph generated from the IFC schema, enabling data retrieval and
   analysis. Finally, the analyzed and summarized results of BIM data were
   represented based on the structure of the retrieved data. A prototype
   application was developed to validate the proposed approach on the data
   collected during the construction of the terminal of Kunming Airport,
   the largest single building in China. The case study illustrated the
   following: (1) relationships between the user requirements and the data
   users concerned are established, (2) user-concerned data can be
   automatically retrieved and aggregated based on the cloud for BIM, and
   (3) the data are represented in a proper form for a visual view and a
   comprehensive report. With this approach, users can significantly
   benefit from requesting for information and the value of BIM will be
   enhanced.},

Abstract = {To promote the development of BIM technology in the field of
   identification and reinforcement of existing buildings, this paper takes
   concrete structures as the research object, refers to the current
   building seismic identification standards, and develops a BIM-based
   seismic identification system for concrete structures. The research
   establishes a corresponding data integration platform for the existing
   concrete frame structure system. Through the secondary development of
   Revit software, the computer can automatically extract building
   information and automatically generate a BIM model for seismic
   identification. The study shows that the program can provide efficient
   and accurate calculation results in the seismic qualification of
   concrete frame structures. The seismic test of the concrete structure of
   the existing building shows that the concrete strength of some
   components of the building is lower than C20, and the spacing of
   stirrups in the densified area of some beam components is greater than
   100 mm. The seismic structural measures of the building do not meet the
   requirements. However, the measures and the calculation index follow the
   relevant regulations. And the calculated values of all programs are
   highly consistent with the manual calculation results. it can providing
   a new idea for local earthquake prevention.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {739-757},
Abstract = {Traditional project management applications are appeared working
   separately of their participating project teams and isolating the input
   of each team to both geometry and non-geometry of the project. With the
   introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM), Architectural,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry expected it would be a
   panacea as a tool to effectively collaborate project teams and to
   efficiently share geometry and non-geometry data relevant to not only
   design and construction but also covering the whole life-cycle of the
   project. All these BIM functions are relied on its automation
   capability; in other words, BIM vision totally discourages manual
   processing of data. As a result, good interoperability practice needs to
   pass data automatically between applications of different project teams.
   Many international associations are working in search of full
   interoperability among BIM players of the project; however, the goal is
   yet to succeed. The current study identifies the impact due to poor
   interoperability between applications and takes considerable effort to
   minimise or eliminate if possible. Software Interoperability Matrix
   (SIM) is the proposed solution delivering the outcome. Action research
   is the methodology adopted to develop SIM, in which researchers and
   professionals actively participated. Major industry contribution of SIM
   is to realise interoperability issues between BIM players prior to the
   project and upon identification, precautionary measures can be taken
   introducing new plug-ins or completely switching to new compatible
   application if it is the only solution.},

Abstract = {Purpose The number of life cycle assessment studies related to seafood
   has risen considerably in the past decade. Despite this proliferation,
   major life cycle inventory databases tend to lack information describing
   this sector. Hence, the main objectives of this study are to present the
   first effort to aggregate and standardize seafood-related datasets in
   the ecoinvent database and to explain the main data sources and
   methodological choices used in the building of the datasets. Methods A
   list of the main datasets included in this first series is presented
   with a brief description of the underlying modelling approaches. Seafood
   capture, production and processing activities were modelled as the use
   phase of the required infrastructure. The full life cycle of
   infrastructure was considered, from construction, through use and
   maintenance to end-of-life. Results and discussion Some of the most
   representative seafood industries in South America were modelled, namely
   Peruvian anchovy and hake fisheries, Andean trout, Brazilian tilapia and
   Peruvian fishmeal production, as well as the production of canned,
   frozen, cured and of a multi-ingredient fish-based product (fish
   sticks). Inventory data were found to be in line with those of seafood
   LCA literature and driven by the parameters widely known to be critical:
   fuel use intensity for fisheries, feed conversion ratio for aquaculture
   and energy intensity for seafood processing and reduction into fishmeal.
   The modelling approach was modular and intuitive, thus useful and
   reproducible by database users and data providers. Conclusions The
   datasets created constitute a robust basis for the use of
   seafood-related data in international databases. It is expected that
   this work will stimulate further efforts by practitioners and data
   providers to model their inventory data into ecoinvent and other life
   cycle inventory databases.},

Abstract = {Currently, construction industry becomes more innovative, competitive
   and complex, more participants are involved in projects and thus, more
   integrated collaboration is needed especially during the design phase of
   the construction life cycle process. Accordingly. the construction
   industry especially the developing country including Malaysia has been
   urged to use innovative construction techniques, and to shift from the
   traditional practice of project delivery to an integrated practice.
   Unfortunately, most of the current construction project developments
   especially in Malaysia are still based on the traditional construction
   process approach; fragmented and separation of the design and
   construction phase. This fragmented practice has been widely criticised
   due to the related problems such as reworks, time delay, rising costs,
   lack of communication and coordination, and wastages. This paper aims to
   highlight this fragmentation issue and discuss the definition. concept
   and potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as an. integrated
   tool that can minised the issue. Further the discussion of research
   process on how to develop a framework of BIM implementation in Malaysian
   will be concluded.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (i.e., BIM) has been widely applied in
   civil engineering structures and infrastructures. Long-term performance
   of structures is of significance in whole life management, and BIM
   provides a useful tool to assess the durability of civil engineering
   structures at the design stage. Cracking is a significant durability
   problem in reinforced concrete structures as it destroys the integrity
   of the structures and causes premature failure. It is therefore
   desirable to predict the cracking of reinforced concrete structures and
   integrate the model in BIM platform so that better-informed decisions
   can be made for designers in terms of repairs and maintenance. In this
   paper, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) are combined to predict concrete cracking over time. The combined
   method is achieved in the BIM Application Programming Interface (API) to
   realise the whole life management. Moreover, maintenance strategies are
   developed which have an impact on structure bearing capacity and cost
   analysis. Meanwhile, optimised construction process decision could be
   made to allow designers and practising engineers to understand the
   serviceability and economic situation of the structures easily.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-30},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The systems engineering of some systems often involves challenging
   modelling activity (MA). MA presents challenges, which include
   understanding the context in which it takes place, understanding and
   managing its impacts on the life cycles of the models it produces. In
   this paper, we propose a methodology and its underpinning framework for
   addressing these challenges and for coping with the operation of MA. The
   first step in our methodology is to characterize MA as a federation of
   systems. It then consists in iteratively building a system architecture
   by modelling the models produced by MA and their expected life cycles,
   modelling the various tasks that constitute MA, and modelling the
   effects of MA on these life cycles. It then makes it possible to specify
   expectations over these life cycles and to analyse models of MA in
   relation to expectations, to check how far expectations are achievable
   and to synthesize the acceptable behaviours of the system. Finally, a
   use of the results of this analysis may provide insightful data on how
   the system is end-to-end operated and how it might behave. On the basis
   of this information, informed decisions may be made to act on the
   logistics of MA. The hypotheses, theoretical foundations, the models,
   the algorithms and perspectives relating to the proposed methodology and
   its underpinning framework are all presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite the availability of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   technologies for well over a decade now, their wide-scale adoption has
   been largely limited to the design stage for model authoring. The
   ultimate benefits from BIM have so far eluded the wider stakeholders at
   the project level and ultimately the end clients in any significant way.
   It is now accepted that the BIM technologies, on their own, would never
   achieve the overall benefits for the end clients as they potentially
   could. To address this, level 2 (L2) BIM has been proposed as an
   approach to BIM-based asset procurement as a set of processes, standards
   and contractual protocols for effective information management
   throughout the life cycle of an asset. This paper presents the
   implementation of the L2 BIM approach for a large asset-owning
   organisation, NHS Scotland. An approach for the application of current
   knowledge on L2 BIM in a practical scenario with a view to it being
   replicable by other organisations is proposed. A set of challenges that
   may arise in practice and pointers on how to address them are also
   outlined. In addition, a stepped approach for transition from level 1 to
   level 2 BIM is also suggested.},

Abstract = {The BIM model is the central point of data and information and has,
   therefore, diverse potential for the entire life cycle of a
   building.These advantages were still largely unused in the submission
   process.The City of Vienna is following a very innovative path and
   started the EU-funded research project BRISE-Vienna, in which a complete
   openBIM building submission process is being developed. This article
   deals with the necessary openBIM basics, the test routines and the legal
   situation in Vienna. This serves as the basis of different BIM-based
   models that are required in the course of the submission process. In
   addition to the building application model submitted by the planners,
   the building law requirements result in a reference model and an
   application information model. The last two models are used for the
   semi-automatic building law review of the building application model.
   The development of a detailed test setting is required for the model
   test. This is an iterative development process, which will be
   transferred to the real operation of an openBIM submission process after
   the research project.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research described in this article is to improve
   measurement, prediction and optimization of sustainable building
   material performance by integrating a decision-making framework for
   sustainable material selection of building materials with a building
   information modeling (BIM) tool. Integration of a BIM model with a
   decision-making tool and sustainable material selection addresses the
   difficulties of making decisions earlier in the design/build process and
   allows for specific sustainability trade-off analyses to be conducted,
   using the actual building conditions and characteristics. It is intended
   to improve the way building material data is utilized in a building
   throughout its life cycle, and to model the impact of design,
   maintenance, operations and occupant behavior modification decisions
   made in an effort to improve the building's contribution to a
   sustainable infrastructure. Pertinent information contained within a BIM
   model is extracted, and utilized in decision making related to material
   selection and to the development of `what-if' scenarios. Decision makers
   will be able to evaluate options for improving their building materials'
   environmental sustainability performance. The research provides a new
   means for sharing data amongst various building modeling programs using
   a decision analysis model and a new tool for making design decisions
   related to sustainable building design.},

Abstract = {With the development of The Times, people's demands on the pipeline
   system are higher and higher. There are more and more pipeline types,
   and the design of pipeline engineering becomes more and more complex.
   Therefore, the use of CAD and other software for pipeline engineering
   design is gradually unable to meet the growing demand. Especially in
   today's more and more complex pipeline design, pipeline design is always
   met with problems such as collision or intersection, and the design of
   two-dimensional software makes these problems a little helpless.
   However, with the introduction of BIM technology, BIM technology is a
   technology that can build three-dimensional models and share and
   transmit architectural information, and is applicable to the entire life
   cycle of buildings. This paper mainly discusses the application of
   building water supply and drainage pipeline design based on BIM
   technology, in order to provide systematic theoretical guidance for

Abstract = {The residential sector is one of the most significant energy consumers
   and therefore contributes significantly to climate change. A study of
   not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated
   consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to
   reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retro-fitting existing
   buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse
   gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For
   this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located
   in the city of Vitoria, in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The
   analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages.
   Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials
   that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed
   operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also
   verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical
   Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential
   Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance
   was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit
   measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building,
   namely, a 15\% reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of
   10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some
   international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in
   the operational stage of both buildings, in both labelling and energy
   consumption.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the
   facility's life cycle for various applications, such as design,
   construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing
   buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using
   dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser
   scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the
   material and textural information of the buildings' elements. This paper
   presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture
   rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and
   textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using
   thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture
   thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These
   images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a
   segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are
   then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal
   infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to
   build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in
   each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural
   information from the images. The extracted textural and material
   information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing
   the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general
   including energy efficiency, among others.},

Abstract = {Explainability is generally considered an important means to gain trust
   in complex automated decision support systems. Different types of
   explainability of processes and models used in a complex information
   fusion solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are relevant
   throughout its life-cycle, i.e. during the system development as well as
   its deployment. However, it is often difficult to understand the real
   value of explainability in specific cases. To study the impact of
   explainability on trust, there is a need to emphasize the trust building
   processes, especially various types of evaluations supporting trust
   assessment. The paper emphasizes that the value of explainability is as
   an enabler of certain types of evaluations leading to improved trust in
   automated solutions. A conceptual model brings together different types
   of explainability, evaluations, and operational conditions along with
   human factors influencing the trust in automated systems. The introduced
   model describes the types of possible evaluations and related
   explainability at different stages of life cycles of AI-based
   information fusion solutions. This enables adaptation of life cycles,
   such that the trust assessment is facilitated. The concepts are
   illustrated with the help of examples using different modelling and
   processing techniques.},

Abstract = {The development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has enabled new
   opportunities, such as standard data storage and collaborative building
   design. Moreover, there exist many Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools and
   Building Energy Performance (BEP) simulators that use the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) exports of BIM platforms as input for further
   operational analysis. While the extracted IFC files contain numerical
   and tabular data from the BIM model, the visual data including floor
   plans and section drawings is often obtained directly from the original
   3D software such as REVIT. In this study, we introduce an open-source
   solution, BatchPlan, for batch processing IFC files of medium- and
   high-rise building projects, leading to floor plan extraction on a large
   scale. Furthermore, we have designed a user-friendly graphical interface
   that allows users to select floors manually. BatchPlan is based on
   open-source Python packages; thus users can easily edit and adapt it to
   their specific requirements. The presented solution enables a scalable
   data generation pipeline for downstream tasks that require extensive
   quantitative analysis, such as machine learning models to perform
   material detection, volume estimation, and environmental impact
   prediction.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment based environmental impact estimation model for
   pre-stressed concrete beam bridge in the early design phase},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {47-56},

Abstract = {The late rise in global concern for environmental issues such as global
   warming and air pollution is accentuating the need for environmental
   assessments in the construction industry. Promptly evaluating the
   environmental loads of the various design alternatives during the early
   stages of a construction project and adopting the most environmentally
   sustainable candidate is therefore of large importance. Yet, research on
   the early evaluation of a construction project's environmental load in
   order to aid the decision making process is hitherto lacking. In light
   of this dilemma, this study proposes a model for estimating the
   environmental load by employing only the most basic information
   accessible during the early design phases of a project for the
   pre-stressed concrete (PSC) beam bridge, the most common bridge
   structure. Firstly, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the
   data from 99 bridges by integrating the bills of quantities (BOQ) with a
   life cycle inventory (LCI) database. The processed data was then
   utilized to construct a case based reasoning (CBR) model for estimating
   the environmental load. The accuracy of the estimation model was then
   validated using five test cases; the model's mean absolute error rates
   (MAER) for the total environmental load was calculated as 7.09\%. Such
   test results were shown to be superior compared to those obtained from a
   multiple-regression based model and a slab area base-unit analysis
   model. Henceforth application of this model during the early stages of a
   project is expected to highly complement environmentally friendly
   designs and construction by facilitating the swift evaluation of the
   environmental load from multiple standpoints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {As a data tool applicable to the full life-cycle of construction
   engineering and management, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has
   great potential for significantly increasing project productivity and
   performance. Awareness of BIM application hotspots and forecasting its
   trends can drive innovations in construction field. Using patents as
   data resources, this study develops an effective framework integrating
   the citation network analysis and the topic clustering technology to
   identify BIM application information and forecast its trends. This
   framework comprises three-step analysis: (1) quantitative characteristic
   analysis of patent outputs; (2) Social Network Analysis (SNA)-based
   co-occurrence network analysis; and (3) identification of BIM topics
   using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, the case
   demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework contributing to promote
   technological development and innovation of BIM. The contributions of
   this study are threefold: (1) an innovative text mining-based framework
   for BIM patent analysis in construction is developed; (2) patents that
   have focused on identifying the application hotspots and development
   trend of BIM in accordance with our developed framework are reviewed;
   and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of BIM

Abstract = {Building information modeling ( BIM) brings interoperability to the
   architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (
   AEC/FM) industry by providing an information backbone throughout a
   building's life-cycle. Information interoperability or data mapping is
   critical for seamless information sharing between BIM and FM, because
   the approaches to information representation in BIM and in FM systems
   are different. The geometric and semantic information in BIM can be
   represented by IFC schema, while the FM data is commonly represented in
   a corresponding relational database. Even though COBie is a neutral data
   format to deliver information from BIM to FM, the data structure of
   COBie does not incomplete to represent all information from BIM to FM.
   Therefore, there is a lack of an appropriate solution to smoothly
   integrate BIM with FM. This paper aims to address the information
   interoperability issue and propose an ontology-based methodology
   framework for data mapping between BIM and FM. Based on the proposed
   framework, an ontology approach is developed as a tool to facilitate the
   facility knowledge management and to improve the data mapping process.
   Finally, a case application about facility maintenance activity is
   implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the ontology approach.},

Abstract = {Global warming potential is one of the most important life cycle
   assessment indicator, which shows how much heat a greenhouse gas traps
   in the atmosphere relative to CO2. In this study, we calculated the
   global warming potential of a highly insulated building construction
   detail of a residential nearly-zero energy building based on numerical
   simulations. To calculate the heat loss of building constructions, which
   is necessary for estimating the operational energy demand in the use
   phase of the building, we compared two numerical simulation methods: 2-D
   thermal simulations and 2-D conjugated heat and moisture transfer
   simulations. Besides that, we compared the effect of selecting different
   thermal insulation materials for insulating the building constructions,
   such as EPS, mineral wool, and wood wool. We then compared the thermal
   and linear thermal transmittances from the simulations besides
   evaluating the moisture transmittance behaviour of the constructions. In
   all examined scenarios, the constructions with mineral wool ended up
   being the highest impact alternative, while EPS was the lowest for walls
   and wood wool was for wall corner joints. We also found that including
   the wall corner joints in global warming potential calculations could
   increase the overall global warming potential of an average-sized family
   house by 10\%. Our study shows the heat and moisture transfer induced
   differences between thermal insulations, and demonstrates that heat and
   moisture transfer modelling-based life cycle assessment indicator of
   building construction details gives valuable additional information
   designers to choose the proper thermal insulation.},

Abstract = {The integration of laser scanning technology and Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) processes offers a transformative approach to managing
   the complexities in live construction projects. This paper aims to
   explore the significant impacts of incorporating laser scanning and BIM
   on construction projects in terms of as-built models, information
   management, and overall project performance utilising case study
   analysis of a building that was not BIM-based. The research scope is
   defined by the need to investigate the integration of laser scanning and
   BIM in live construction projects. It details the data acquisition
   process, challenges encountered due to site obstructions, and the
   methodologies employed for spatial modelling procedures. Key findings
   reveal that such integration can significantly enhance the accuracy of
   data collection and improve project outcomes. Results also identify the
   need for specialised equipment and skills for the effective
   implementation of such integrations. The research concludes by offering
   a practical approach to enhancing construction processes, from design to
   maintenance. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by
   providing a detailed analysis of the practical application of laser
   scanning and BIM in a live construction project, offering insights into
   the benefits, challenges, and future directions for integrating these

Abstract = {Despite the apparent simplicity of existing BIM-LCA tools, there is a
   lack of integration with the main BIM software, and the double-effort of
   design development and parallel simulations is a barrier to their
   implementation in the design process. Moreover, simplifications on these
   tools may provide misleading results to the designer. The main aim of
   this research is to develop an integration interface of
   manufacturer-based LCA data into a BIM platform by combining
   applications of existing and consolidated tools (namely, Autodesk Revit
   and Dynamo, and Microsoft Excel), in order to obtain environmental
   profiles for decision-making in the initial design stages, requiring
   less time, effort and ad hoc experts. The methodological procedures were
   aggregated into the following system development and testing phases: (a)
   input data organization, (b) creating new parameters on BIM software,
   (c) visual programming, (d) results analysis for decision-making and (e)
   simulation of social housing. The results of the developed tool provided
   complete results automatically, not requiring the designer to make
   changes in the software or interfaces. Some limitations were identified
   during development and application, due to the lack of LCA data
   availability by manufacturers, the complexity of data programming
   importation and extraction on BIM software for different construction
   subsystems, and the complexity of LCA results analysis and understanding
   encountered by non-experts. Regarding the latter, the research concluded
   that broad knowledge dissemination is still necessary to improve
   awareness regarding this environmental assessment methodology, in
   addition to determining the most advantageous environmental performance
   parameters, as a reference point for comparison.},

Abstract = {The extensive impact of construction on the environment and the
   increasing demand for greener buildings have pushed forward the building
   industry to adopt new approaches for sustainable building design. In the
   light of this issue, many countries developed their own green rating
   system for building sustainability assessment and rating. However, the
   process of executing this task to benchmark building sustainability is
   based on fragmented and manual methods which is time-consuming,
   laborious and inefficient. Simultaneously, many research and real case
   studies have argued that the implementation of Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) in green building design process is advantageous
   throughout the building life cycle. One of the critical research topics
   in such implementation is the integration of BIM with green rating
   systems in order to assess building sustainability and facilitate green
   certification documents provision. Hence, the purpose of this paper is
   to review available BIM-based methodologies and proposed models made for
   green building assessment and certification, which have been developed
   to be integrated with several rating systems around the world such as
   LEED (R) and BREEAM (R). The results show that the integration of BIM
   with green building rating system is applicable. Nevertheless, still
   more focus on specific rating systems, mainly LEED (R). Thus, further
   research and development are required in this area to integrate other
   recent rating systems and enhance the level of automation by integrating
   green material databases and new BIM technologies such as visual
   programing and cloud-based databases.},

Abstract = {BIM (Building Information Modelling), or modelling based on object data,
   is a process that involves the construction of virtual objects, i.e. the
   creation and management of digital representations of physical and
   functional characteristics of objects. The BIM system, therefore, is
   used to create a model using relevant information. BIM is applicable
   throughout the entire life cycle of a building, from the design phase,
   and is then also applicable in the phases of construction as well as
   management and maintenance. There are many software packages based on
   the BIM concept. Those are digital software packages used to create 3D
   object representations with layers of additional project information.
   Basically, the BIM system parameters are ``intelligent{''} objects that
   are not only visual displays, but also contain other information
   required in the design process and the preparation of project
   documentation. BIM software allows various kinds of analysis of objects.
   It has wide application in the theory of structures and static load
   analysis, because it allows a variety of analyses and 3D simulations as
   well as a range of calculations and the dimensioning of structural
   parts.},

   Interior Components},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The more detailed building information modeling (BIM) is, the more
   accurate are the quantities that can be extracted in BIM-based quantity
   take-off. However, the time and cost typically allowed for modeling are
   insufficient to extract accurate quantities throughout a project's life
   cycle. In addition, variations in quantity interfere with estimating
   accurate construction costs. Despite the recognition that extracted
   quantities can differ depending on the details of building interior
   components, the number and extent of discrepancies, or whether these
   would differ by material, is unknown. Therefore, this study identifies
   and analyzes the approximately 6-9\% quantity discrepancy (QD) in
   quantities extracted from different building interior components, in
   order to improve the accuracy of cost estimation using BIM. The
   discrepancy was analyzed by comparing the extracted quantities via two
   different model types, specifically a compositely modeled object and an
   individually modeled object. These models were applied to four cases of
   interior work in residential units. Results indicate that the QD occurs
   non-sequentially and exceeds the loss rates for some interior materials.
   Furthermore, this study identifies the causative factors of the QD by
   common features observed in the particular materials and suggests
   modeling and measurement strategies for minimizing QD.},

Abstract = {With the dawn of the knowledge economy, China's university campus
   construction has reached its pinnacle. However, there are numerous
   issues with the related construction process, such as scale imbalances,
   architectural style convergence, loss of environmental characteristics,
   and a lack of spirit of place on many university campuses, all of which
   eventually lead to incompatibility between campus architecture and
   landscape environment, dilution of campus cultural atmosphere, and lack
   of sustenance for university humanistic spirit. The quality of the
   campus landscape has become a key criterion for judging the campus
   environment, as it has a significant impact on the overall environment,
   image, and quality of the campus. To improve the quality of the campus
   landscape environment, landscape design must be considered as part of
   architectural planning and design, and campus architecture and landscape
   must be integrated. Campus landscape engineering construction has a full
   life cycle, and construction safety has an impact on the overall
   situation. To ensure construction safety throughout the life cycle, a
   solid mathematical model of construction safety management should be
   established. This paper proposes using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) to conduct research on landscape security, starting with the
   development of university campus landscapes and using mobile edge
   computing technology.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {The use of Building Automation and Control Networks (BACN) is becoming
   increasingly wide spread, largely due to the benefits to end-users and
   energy management companies of controlling the systems installed in
   buildings. At the same time, the digitalisation of buildings is
   increasing every day with the adoption of technologies such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), allowing a high level of digital control in
   all phases of the building life cycle. However, although the use of BIM
   is spreading to obtain a digital model of the building, it is not very
   common to include the existing control systems in BIM models. The
   integration of BACN-to-BIM seems to be the most appropriate process to
   have all the information of a building, as it would allow to digitalise
   and connect both the geometric and the logical part, but it is a
   challenge to be faced in terms of interoperability. This paper shows the
   BACN2BIM tool, a tool to make it easier for technical users the creation
   of monitoring networks linked to BIM models of a building, based on
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. The BACN2BIM tool will allow
   owners and technical users to easily download dynamic monitoring data,
   real-time data of the measurements obtained from devices installed in
   their buildings (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, CO2
   concentration, etc.) The tool has been tested in a case study and in a
   real demo case located in Spain, showing a time reduction in updating a
   BIM model with the devices of an existing monitoring system and in the
   download of existing monitoring data.},

Abstract = {Constructing sustainable buildings nowadays doesn't seem a problem of
   technology but of sufficient planning approach. Thus, a lot of
   techniques as e.g. regarding to zero net building etc. exist but are not
   implemented broadly. This seems also a problem caused by insufficient
   knowledge of the builders. Furthermore, even when minimizing the
   environmental impact is intended, e.g. in the framework of sustainable
   building assessment (SBA), the assessment methods are only applied after
   main decisions are made. Thus, the potential of applying life cycle
   assessment (LCA) tools early in the process is still to be exploited.
   This contribution presents an information platform that bases on an
   ongoing research project, in which ways are examined of how to better
   connect BIM-planning (Building Information Modeling) to LCA tools and

Abstract = {This study presents a proposed environmental management plan (EMP) for
   construction waste management (CWM). This life cycle thinking
   (LCT)-based EMP for CWM is set to constitute three sections. The former
   investigates means of waste minimization via source control strategies.
   The second section dis-cusses CWM by monitoring and tracking the path of
   input building materials and output construction waste. The final
   section presents an input-output quantitative assessment of the CWM
   strategies under-taken. The proposed LCT-based EMP defines actions and
   activities for different phases and pinpoints the methods and procedures
   across the entire building process. Finally, it is applied to two groups
   of case studies showing the difference between CWM practices for
   green-certified and non-certified projects. The outcome shows how the
   proposed plan can present a novel approach integrating environmental
   management and best practices for CWM. This shall facilitate complying
   with international standards and building rating systems for achieving
   environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {Advancements in information technology in the architecture, engineering,
   construction, and operations (AECO) industry have led to the deployment
   of building information modeling (BIM) throughout the life cycle of
   buildings. BIM represents a collaborative and information-rich
   environment that can be used in the design, construction, and facility
   management phases of a project. BIM can also be used to visualize the
   construction project as an immersive environment using virtual and
   augmented reality. Similar environments can be developed using game
   engines to further elaborate on the information embedded in a building
   information model. This study presents a new visualization technique for
   building information models and interactive holograms and validates
   their effectiveness through an experimental study. A plugin to automate
   the transfer of models into game engines, software to enable intuitive
   interaction with the hologram using hand gestures and voice commands,
   and a display platform that allows the visualization of the hologram
   were developed. The results of the study showed that the developed
   plugin is more effective than traditional methods used to export
   building models from modeling platforms into a gaming environment.
   Moreover, the interactive hologram was determined to be user-friendly
   and a good learning tool for construction management education. The
   developed technologies enhance the BIM-data, human-building, and
   human-human levels of interaction necessary for a successful BIM
   visualization environment and make a collaborative visualization tool
   available to construction project teams for more effective
   communication. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

   Cairo started in 2019 by offering a collaborative course on BIM to
   students in the Architecture and Civil programs of the Engineering
   faculty, in consideration of the existing overlap in the disciplines
   perspectives and in an effort to boost shared views through Group
   projects and conducted, guest lecture speakers are invited, and cases

Title = {Exploring the value of BIM for corporate real estate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {254-269},
Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modelling (BIM) offers rich opportunities
   for property professionals to use information throughout the property
   life cycle. However, the benefits of BIM for property professionals are
   largely untapped. BIM was developed by the architecture, engineering and
   construction (AEC) sector to assist in managing design and construction
   data. As these technologies mature and evolve, so does the opportunity
   for other professional groups to use data within, or linked to, BIM
   models. This paper aims to explore the potential for corporate real
   estate managers (CREM) and investment surveyors to use data contained in
   BIM models and building management systems, which could help these
   professionals with strategic planning, portfolio rationalisation and
   acquisitions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a scoping study to explore the
   potential to expand the scope of BIM to other professional activities.
   As such, the research adopted a Delphi approach with a series of
   workshops with experienced stakeholders in Australia and England.
   Qualitative research is inductive and hypothesis-generating. That is, as
   the researcher assimilates knowledge and information contained in the
   literature, ideas and questions are formed, which are put to research
   participants, and, from this process, conclusions are drawn.
   Findings - It is technologically feasible for some property
   professionals, such as CREM, to use some data contained within BIM, and
   linked building management systems. The types of data used by property
   professionals were identified and ranked in importance. Needs are
   varied, both in the range of data and the points in the property life
   cycle when they are required. The benefits identified include
   potentially accessing and using more reliable and accurate data in
   professional tasks; however, challenges exist around the fidelity of the
   data and assurances that it is current.
   Research limitations/implications - The key limitations of the research
   were that the views expressed are those of a select group of experienced
   practitioners and may not represent the consensus view of the
   professions and industry as a whole. The limitations and criticisms of
   focus group data collection are that individuals holding strong views
   may dominate the sessions.
   Practical implications - The findings show that expanding access to BIM
   could enable some property professionals, including CREM, to utilise
   relevant data that could improve the quality and accuracy of their
   professional services. A simple initial system could be trialled to
   ascertain the value of the data. Over time, the availability of data
   could be extended to allow more professionals access. Furthermore, there
   is potential to link BIM to other digitised property data in the future.
   Originality/value - To date, no one has considered the practicality or
   potential utility of expanding the access to data contained in 3D BIM
   models to property professionals, nor has anyone considered which data
   would be useful to them. The value of using BIM data is that, as more
   property stock is delivered and maintained via BIM-enabled processes, it
   will be possible for a wider range of professionals such as CREM and
   investment surveyors to offer more accurate advice and services to
   clients.},

   information modeling processes; the application is implemented and
   tested on a local blockchain. The proposed model represents a so-called
   digital twin and is, hence, a huge system that manages all the
   information flow associated with a building throughout its life cycle,
   returning to individuals the control of their own data. In this model,
   all stakeholders operate based on so-called decentralized identifiers

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is often used in
   construction, not only at the building planning stage but also for
   life-cycle related tasks such as building progress control,
   digitally-assisted maintenance and remote inspection. These tasks
   require methods for localization of a mobile sensor in the BIM model.
   This paper presents an approach for LiDAR scan localization in BIM that
   is based on a combination of SLAM tracking and point cloud to BIM
   registration, embedded in a flexible system that can be used for
   Augmented Reality inspection of buildings or remote robot control. We
   used axis alignment, a novel normal-filtered template matching approach
   and an Interactive Closest Point algorithm to register the scan point
   cloud to the BIM point cloud. First localization accuracy evaluations
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Localization in a 28 m long
   hallway is accurate up to 0.03 m when the BIM model used for the
   localization consists only of the hallway. In a more complex
   environment, containing multiple similarly shaped rooms and hallways,
   the localization is accurate up to 0.2 m in the first 60 m of sensor
   movement, and up to 0.3 m in the following travel up to 130 m.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is gaining prominence in
   international construction projects (ICPs). While BIM is able to improve
   project performance and address certain ICP risks, it can also increase
   the number of risks to ICPs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive
   review for addressing risks in BIM-enabled ICPs. A cross-systematic
   review approach was adopted to consider limited sources of references
   when reviewing risks in BIM-enabled ICPs as a single subject. Hence, six
   steps of reviews were formulated in connection with ICP risks,
   BIM-related risks, risk analysis and management techniques, and BIM
   uses. The findings of the cross-systematic review indicate (a) current
   and potential BIM uses in dealing with ICP risks, and (b) current and
   potential risk analyses and management techniques in addressing
   BIM-related risks. The review provides practical references for industry
   players and valuable insights into the future development of new BIM
   uses and risk management in BIM-enabled ICPs.},

Abstract = {PurposeFacility management (FM) is regarded as an emerging issue in
   civil engineering and is responsible for ensuring the building's
   expected performance. The purpose of this study is to analyze buildings'
   current FM processes for educational and high residential segments and
   propose an FM-building information modeling (BIM) (BIM6D) to understand
   the information flow and leading players with and without FM-BIM
   integration. Design/methodology/approachThe research strategy was a case
   study with data from the FM process of two buildings. This study was
   carried out in three stages: diagnosis of FM of the two buildings,
   FM-BIM integration and information flow and leading players analysis.
   Maintenance activities were categorized according to periodicity and
   status criteria for each project element for FM-BIM integration and were
   visualized in the Revit design using Dynamo software. FindingsThe
   results of this study show differences in how FM is conducted,
   especially in formalization and preventive character, and similarities
   regarding the difficulty of foreseen and lack of control because of
   scattered, disconnected and incomplete information on both. The visual
   appeal of the FM-BIM integration facilitates information access. It
   optimizes the use of the digital model through the most prolonged phase
   of the life cycle of a building (post-occupation phase). However, FM-BIM
   challenges buildings that do not have digital model expertise as
   residential segments. This study suggests a more significant role for
   construction companies in these cases. Originality/valueThis study
   investigates BIM-FM integration of buildings in two different contexts
   and reveals the importance of a construction company's role in buildings
   in the residential segment. This study contributes with real-life cases
   on BIM in existing buildings, discussing the value and challenges of BIM
   in FM applications.},

Title = {An integrated approach of BIM-enabled LCA and energy simulation: The
   optimized solution towards sustainable development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Passive design strategies such as orientation, shading, sealing,
   glazing, and insulation can significantly reduce the necessity of an
   artificial heating-cooling system, accounting for 40\% of total energy
   usage in the residential building. However, none of the previous studies
   have quantified the energy reduction and their environmental impacts
   simultaneously for these passive design parameters to achieve the
   national standard requirements for house rating. Hence, this study
   focuses on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM-Autodesk
   Revit), energy rating tool (FirstRate5), and BIM-enabled life cycle
   assessment (LCA-Tally) to quantify, compare, and improve the building
   design options to reduce carbon footprint and energy consumptions in
   residential dwellings. Sensitivity analysis has been performed with the
   @Risk Palisade decision tool for optimizing operational energy
   efficiency. The sensitivity indices show the ceiling (0.84-0.96) and the
   wall (0.22-0.37) are the most influential predictors for passive design
   strategies to reduce energy consumption. A moderate correlation exists
   with windows, floors, and orientations (0.13-0.29), where the
   relationship with eave projection, air infiltrations is relatively weak.
   BIM has been used as a platform of interconnectivity between optimized
   operational energy of @Risk optimizer and consequent embodied phases. A
   comparative study of insulation performance identifies that 95\% of the
   ceiling's total operational energy consumption can be minimized using R3
   rather than R6 of the national thermal code. For the wall, 90\% of
   energy minimization can occur using R2 rather than R4 of the national
   thermal code. The study reveals that while insulation is only 1\% of the
   total building mass, and the corresponding carbon footprint and primary
   energy demand are 4\% and 7\%, respectively, LCA explains a significant
   amount of energy, about 76\% reduction at its operational stage. In this
   paper, an evidence-based analytical framework provides a BIM based
   optimization platform to validate and justify the impact categories of
   environment-friendly, energy-efficient design of houses.

Abstract = {Globally, the construction sector has witnessed an apparent shift
   towards green building technology, due to its great potential in
   reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Green building design,
   assessment, and documentation depends on various disjointed analyses,
   required to meet different sustainability performances and standards.
   Nevertheless, the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   technology has paved way for digital construction of complicated
   buildings, generating accurate information for building design,
   construction, and assessment throughout its life cycle. Integrating BIM
   and sustainability rating tools such as Malaysian Carbon Reduction and
   Environmental Sustainability Tool (MyCREST), enables the project team to
   make sustainable analyses and decisions at the conceptual stage of the
   green building. Despite the connectivity, there is no standard workflow
   for BIM-based modelling especially for green building design and
   assessment in Malaysia till date. Moreover, MyCREST certification is
   done manually, resulting to missing data, subjective decisions, and
   waste of time and resources. Therefore, this review paper proposes the
   integration of BIM and MyCREST, focusing on MyCREST design category.
   This is achieved by reviewing relevant literature on sustainable
   construction, MyCREST reference guideline, functionalities of BIM
   software (Autodesk Revit), etc. After the systematic literature review,
   the need for the synergies between BIM and MyCREST in Malaysian
   construction industry was identified. This concept of integrating BIM
   and MyCREST is significant due to the unique approach it proposes to
   design efficiently, and automatically fulfil MyCREST certification of
   green building in Malaysia.},

Title = {Promoting Energy Efficiency in the Built Environment through Adapted BIM
   Training and Education},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The development of new climate change policies has increased the
   motivation to reduce energy use in buildings, as reflected by a
   stringent regulatory landscape. The construction industry is expected to
   adopt new methods and strategies to address such requirements, focusing
   primarily on reducing energy demand, improving process efficiency and
   reducing carbon emissions. However, the realisation of these emerging
   requirements has been constrained by the highly fragmented nature of the
   industry, which is often portrayed as involving a culture of adversarial
   relationships and risk avoidance, which is exacerbated by a linear
   workflow. Recurring problems include low process efficiency, delays and
   construction waste. Building information modelling (BIM) provides a
   unique opportunity to enhance building energy efficiency (EE) and to
   open new pathways towards a more digitalised industry and society. BIM
   has the potential to reduce (a) waste and carbon emissions, (b) the
   endemic performance gap, (c) in-use energy and (d) the total lifecycle
   impact. BIM also targets to improve the whole supply chain related to
   the design, construction as well as the management and use of the
   facility. However, the construction workforce is required to upgrade
   their skills and competencies to satisfy new requirements for delivering
   BIM for EE. Currently, there is a real gap between the industry
   expectations for employees and current training and educational
   programmes. There is also a set of new requirements and expectations
   that the construction industry needs to identify and address in order to
   deliver more informed BIM for EE practices. This paper provides an
   in-depth analysis and gap identification pertaining to the skills and
   competencies involved in BIM training for EE. Consultations and
   interviews have been used as a method to collect requirements, and a
   portfolio of use cases have been created and analysed to better
   understand existing BIM practices and to determine current limitations
   and gaps in BIM training. The results show that BIM can contribute to
   the digitalisation of the construction industry in Europe with adapted
   BIM training and educational programmes to deliver more informed and
   adapted energy strategies.},

Abstract = {Electrical instrumentation and control (EIC) systems can account for as
   much as 60\% of maintainable items as well as being critical to safe and
   efficient operations. Thus, it is imperative that as-built documentation
   is error-free and reflects precisely what has been installed. Yet EIC
   as-built drawings that are produced often contain errors and omissions.
   If EIC systems are ineffectively and inefficiently designed and
   documented, then asset owners' plant, equipment and facilities may fail
   to operate, which can result in considerable economic loss and
   jeopardize system safety. In order to improve the quality, efficiency
   and effectiveness of documentation production, it has been suggested
   that engineers should switch from using-computer-aided design (CAD) to
   an object-oriented model, which takes the form of a systems information
   model. Such a model provides the ability for electrical engineers to
   effectively integrate their work with a building information model. This
   paper builds upon the authors' previous research, which examined the
   need for a SIM by presenting and describing how an object-oriented model
   for EIC can be used through a project's life cycle. Examples are used to
   demonstrate the functionality-and robustness of the SIM. The adoption of
   a SIM will not Only lead to productivity throughout a project's life but
   also reduce the costs associated with managing and maintaining
   information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {BIM-based time-varying system reliability analysis for buildings and
   infrastructures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In recent decades, building information modelling (BIM) technology has
   been rapidly developed and applied widely in the building industry.
   Although BIM technology is crucial for the whole design, construction,
   operation, and maintenance life cycle of building structures, BIM-based
   infrastructure time effect analysis still has limitless potential.
   Nevertheless, the current BIM based study on time effect focuses mostly
   on cost and schedule analyses for buildings. The assessment of
   infrastructure places greater emphasis on component level evaluation and
   ignores how components affect system safety. In this paper, a
   BIM-reliability integrated technology for time-varying and system
   analysis of structural safety is developed. In the developed framework,
   parameters information for calculating component reliability are first
   extracted from the BIM model. The BIM model is then transformed into a
   topology structure and based on the transformed structure, the risk
   assessment is conducted through stochastic approaches. The suggested
   framework is demonstrated using two different cases: a long-term
   corrosion impact analysis example of an underground pipeline network and
   a short-term seismic load analysis instance of a four-layer frame. In
   the short-term analysis, the structural analysis is performed by
   integrating REVIT-Dynamo and OpenSees, taking into account the
   randomness of the material properties and the fabrication size. The
   design optimization can be carried out by comparing the reliability of
   inter-storey displacement under seismic load in different design
   schemes, and the system failure probability is more sensitive to the
   changes in the failure probability of each floor. In the longterm
   analysis, the time-varying reliability and importance index of each pipe
   during its lifetime are calculated using the transformed topology
   algorithm and the stochastic corrosion model. It is found that the
   BIM-reliability integrated technology can effectively evaluate the
   impact of time effect on the safety of the structures and is of great
   significance for structures with unknown working environment and working
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Digitization of buildings requires the systematic handling of a variety
   and volumes of data. It is a common vision to aim for coordinated
   homogenization of data structures, enabled by the classification of
   information. This paper studies the role of building information
   standards for classification in digitization of the building life cycle.
   It draws on science and technology studies of information technology
   standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building
   research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for
   information systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear
   and multiple. The five-year design process of a large hospital in
   Denmark is examined as episodes of performance of the building
   information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco
   Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client
   demands, several building information standards are active over time: an
   expansive' design brief process adds user demands and uses room
   classification. Another process diminishes the design brief more than
   50\%, with several standards in use. The client's facilities management
   system, which performs the structuring of data backwards' into the
   design process, makes architects and engineers (but not contractors) use
   CCS. This fragmentation of performing standards is denoted multiple
   performativities' and includes temporal and compartmental
   performativity.},

Title = {Integration of stochastic approaches in the life cycle cost analysis of
   sewer pipe applications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {35-43},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to integrate stochastic approaches in the
   life cycle cost analysis of sewer pipes. It is generally accepted that
   costs are of the greatest interest to the decision maker. The selection
   procedure primarily depends on the material availability as well as
   empirical information. Afterward costs in the maintenance phase lack
   consideration, which is mainly constrained by data availability and
   analysis techniques. This study focuses on the rigid pipe and evaluates
   the comparable application of reinforced concrete pipe (RCP),
   non-reinforced concrete pipe (NRCP), and vitrified clay pipe (VCP) in
   sewer systems. The life cycle cost analysis is performed throughout the
   material manufacturing, construction and maintenance phases.
   Particularly, the Markov chain model is used to predict systems'
   conditions that are used as a guidance for management in the maintenance
   phase. Under a given strategy, the cost estimate is extended to the
   steady state, providing a new cost comparison perspective. In addition,
   methods to evaluate the model uncertainty are also presented. Applying
   the bootstrapping approach, the analysis reveals that the Markov chains
   model demonstrates decent robustness. In the case study of a 24-in. pipe
   application, results show that NRCP demands the least initial building
   cost, while RCP is more cost effective considering longer service life
   time. Cost comparison and specific examples are also presented to
   demonstrate practical applications. This integrated approach allows
   decision-makers and stakeholders to understand and compare economic
   costs during alternative selections in practice. The methodology
   developed may also be applied in the life cycle analysis of other
   critical infrastructure systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A cradle-to-gate based life cycle impact assessment comparing the

   and common petroleum-based composites as building materials},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {11-21},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Aligning the sustainability in construction process can be achieved
   through material selection process with low impact on environment and
   human health. Today, biocomposite materials are investigated and
   developed to replace with none, and less eco-friendly materials used in
   the construction industry leading to emergence of next generation of
   sustainable and green building materials. This paper aims to develop a
   model of fully hybrid bio-based biocomposite based on Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA), and comparing it with fully petroleum-based composite,
   which are common conventional building materials. The methodology
   framework of this research is determined based on ISO 14040 and 14044.
   Also, the ReCiPe as the common method in SimaPro software is chosen for
   appraising and comparing LC impact assessment (LCIA). This research
   highlights the negative effect of these kinds of building materials with
   providing single scores coming from three gauges including Human Health,
   Ecosystems and resources. It is observed that substituting the
   biocomposite with the fully petroleum based composite has led to a
   decline of about 30\% in single score outcome. The significance of this
   research is related to important judgement information to policy makers
   and the prospective manufacturers in the commercialization phase of this
   new biocomposites as sustainable and green building materials.},

Title = {Decision-making under uncertainty in the early phase of building facade
   design based on multi-objective stochastic optimization},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {226},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In response to the European 2030 climate and energy policy framework and
   to satisfy various stakeholders, trade-offs between different goals
   should be considered in the planning phase of a building. In the early
   phase, uncertainties are inevitable and should be modeled in the
   decision-making process. Especially for early modeling using building
   information modeling tools, it is of interest to find out appropriate
   ``placeholder{''}materials. In this paper, we proposed a multi-objective
   stochastic optimization (MOSO) framework for decision -making in the
   early design phase of building facade design under uncertainty. Herein,
   two types of uncertainty were included: uncertainty in design decisions
   and environmental uncertainty. Coupled with a multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) strategy, the framework aims to narrow down the
   possibilities of the material choice and to provide possibly robust
   solutions. Categorical and continuous parameters were considered to
   achieve three objectives: life cycle assessment in form of global
   warming potential, life cycle cost and thermal transmittance. Through a
   case study with solid timber and brick construction types, the proposed
   framework was validated. Results show that the insulation and outer wall
   cladding are the most varying parameters of the Pareto-optimal solutions
   for building facade design. In general, an environmental advantage in
   solid timber construction and an economic advantage in solid brick
   construction can be seen. With the established framework,
   decision-making considering dynamic changes during the planning process
   can be potentially realized in future works.},

Title = {``Values, Challenges, and Critical Success Factors{''} of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) in Malaysia: Experts Perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a major role in enhancing the
   building project process. However, BIM implementation in building
   projects has not been categorized, and no previous investigation of its
   value in the different building project types has been undertaken. This
   research intended to evaluate BIM implementation in building projects
   and to identify its values, challenges, and enablers. Experts from BIM
   consultancy organizations were the respondents in this study. Based on
   nine interviews and 26 responses to a structured questionnaire, a
   quantitative approach to the content validity method was adopted. The
   results reveal that BIM implementation in mid- and low-rise buildings is
   very low. Only top organizations are able to implement BIM in their
   projects. Experts suggested that local organizations are not able to
   implement BIM due to their inability to adopt the BIM system as a
   digital management process throughout the project life cycle. In
   addition, there was consensus agreement based on the Content Validity
   Ratio (CVR) that BIM adds significant value to building projects, which
   includes providing collaborative organizations, greater communication,
   increased client satisfaction, more cost-savings, increased
   productivity, and a new way of reasoning for projects. This research
   also identified 20 challenges and 45 enablers of BIM implementation in
   mid- and low-rise building construction by the local firms. From the
   result, it was found that the presented variables were reliable, as
   reported in the interview transcripts and based on the majority of
   experts' opinions. This research provides an important list of
   challenges and success factors that need to be considered to overcome
   the critical issue of low BIM implementation in building projects.},

Abstract = {Climate mitigation and efficient use of resources in the building sector
   have become a central issue for sustainable development. Promoting a
   circular economy and reducing global warming at the same time is an
   increasingly important challenge for construction, demolition and
   recycling of buildings. This study assesses the greenhouse gas emissions
   in relation to the resource use of recycled concrete (RC-concrete) and
   transfers the results into a Building Information Modelling application
   for visualization of the footprints results. The town hall building in
   the German city of Korbach was selected as a case study, which was
   selectively demolished and rebuilt with RC-concrete using recycled
   aggregates from the old building. The production of RC-concrete is
   compared with conventional concrete made from natural aggregates. The
   analysis covers the end of life and the production phase of concrete
   within the life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries. The environmental
   assessment is done based on product climate, energy, material and water
   footprints, as reliable benchmarks for climate and resource efficiency
   in the building sector. RC-concrete can decrease the material footprint
   by up to 50\%, whereas the reduction potential for the climate footprint
   is limited and the water footprint can be up to ten times higher with
   wet processing of concrete waste. The visualization of footprint results
   using LCA and digital planning software will further enhance the low
   carbon architectural design and circularity in the building sector.},

Title = {Investigating Critical Non-Value Adding Activities and Their Resulting
   Wastes in BIM-Based Project Delivery},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is deemed a useful innovation for
   technological and sustainable development of the economy. It is
   partially used in building projects in Singapore, although its
   implementation is mandated by the local government, resulting in various
   wastes and suboptimal productivity. Little is known about how non-value
   adding (NVA) BIM implementation practices were perceived by the local
   practitioners and how these practices affected productivity in building
   projects in Singapore. This study aimed to identify critical NVA BIM
   implementation activities and investigate the criticality of their
   resulting wastes to productivity performance in the current project
   delivery process in Singapore. The results from a questionnaire survey
   of 73 experts and four post-survey interviews in Singapore revealed that
   38 NVA BIM implementation activities were deemed critical, among which
   ``lack of involvement by contractors to contribute site knowledge{''} in
   the design development phase was ranked top; the top five resulting
   wastes with highest criticalities were reworks/abortive works, requests
   for information, design deficiencies, defects, and waiting/idle time.
   Furthermore, an independent-samples t-test was conducted to examine
   whether construction firms and upfront stakeholders perceived the NVA
   activities differently. It was discovered that most NVA activities
   exerted more agreement from construction firms than upfront
   non-construction organizations. Six strategies were proposed to mitigate
   the NVA activities and wastes. The findings can help practitioners
   identify weak areas of their BIM implementation practices and prioritize
   resources accordingly to eliminate the wastes and foster sustainability,
   as well as help overseas project teams, with minor adjustments,
   customize their own NVA BIM implementation activities and management
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The life cycle of a building begins with the planning process. The
   planning or pre-planning stage is when the most effective decisions are
   made. Both in terms of time and financial resources, changes made to
   certain design solutions at this stage are less costly compared to later
   stages of architectural design, not to mention during the construction
   process itself. The success of a building's architectural planning
   solutions, how convenient the site and the building are to use and the
   economical indicators of constructing the building depend mostly on
   decisions made during the planning stage. BIM can be used for building
   spatial planning. This would allow architects to assess the planned
   building, its influence on the environment and the influence of the
   environment on the building even earlier and more comprehensively. The
   paper proposes a model and algorithm for the planning stage of building
   using BIM. Creating a spatial model for a building using the proposed
   algorithm will produce a model for specific building and site solutions.
   The entirety of the solutions used in the building and site design has
   been considered in compliance with all of the requirements of national
   law and compulsory regulatory technical documents. The model can then be
   used for further architectural design. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Realizing a Quick Partial BIM Update of Subgrade in Railway Stations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {A railway station subgrade (RSS) is a complex earth structure for
   supporting various railway facilities and its building information
   modeling (BIM) is an essential task in a railway station project. During
   the entire life cycle of an RSS BIM model, it will be frequently updated
   according to the progress of the project. However, the current way of
   updating an RSS model is commonly conducted in a complete rebuild, which
   is very inefficient and time-consuming. To address this issue, we
   propose a novel approach for realizing a partial BIM update driven by
   model changes, through which a quick update for an existing RSS BIM
   model can be achieved. A partial updating strategy that is triggered by
   a model change is developed to locate a minimum influenced domain of the
   original model and update it in that domain. An actual railway station
   case is used for demonstrating the validity of the approach, through
   which a quick partial update to an existing RSS model is achieved by
   skipping the redundant computations in the process of a complete
   rebuild.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows are becoming very
   relevant for the different stages of the project's lifecycle, more data
   is produced and managed across it. The information and data accumulated
   in BIMbased projects present an opportunity for analysis and extraction
   of project knowledge from the inception to the operation phase. In other
   industries, Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be an
   effective approach to automate processes and extract useful insights
   from different types and sources of data. The rapid development of ML
   applications, the growing generation of BIM-related data in projects,
   and the different needs for use of this data present serious challenges
   to adopt and effectively apply ML techniques to BIM-based projects in
   the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO)
   industry. While research on the use of BIM data through ML has increased
   in the past decade, it is still in a nascent stage. In order to asses
   where the industry stands today, this paper carries out a systematic
   literature review (SLR) identifying and summarizing common emerging
   areas of application and utilization of ML within the context of
   BIM-generated data. Moreover, the paper identifies research gaps and
   trends. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research
   directions are suggested, focusing on information architecture and data,
   applications scalability, and human information interactions.},

Abstract = {With advancements in new technologies in the industry, efforts have been
   made to adopt various smart devices during the life cycle of building
   construction. However, little attention has been paid to developing a
   work process model to maximize the benefits of smart technologies. While
   identifying the shortcomings of conventional quality inspection, this
   study configures a new quality inspection process model in collaboration
   with smart devices. Based on the proposal, the study developed a new
   tool that effectively improves the current quality inspection practice.
   The final goal of this research is to propose a novel inspection process
   model by developing an Application Programming Interface (API) system
   using Building Information Model (BIM) software. Additionally, to verify
   the applicability of the system, this study includes a case study on
   tile work and confirms the effects of a prototype of the proposed system
   through an expert survey. The survey results reveal that the proposed
   system is effective and practical. This research contributes to
   maximizing the effectiveness of using smart devices and supporting

   management by combining a BIM-based life cycle sustainability assessment
   framework and hybrid MCDA approach},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 8},
Abstract = {Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition
   waste management (DWM) from a life cycle-thinking perspective. To this
   end, facilitating sustainability-oriented decision-making for DWM
   planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing
   multifaceted criteria. This study develops a building information
   modelling (BIM)-based DWM sustainability assessment approach to
   facilitate the life cycle assessment (LCA) and decision-making by
   coupling the enriched Industry Foundation Classes model with hybrid
   multi-criteria decision-aiding (MCDA) methods using Dynamo visual

   enriched the BIM properties and accommodated them into the LCA data
   template to enhance data interoperability, thus achieving seamless data
   transfer. Moreover, hybrid MCDA methods are integrated into the
   decision-making workflow for DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study is
   employed to verify the applicability of the decision-aiding framework.
   The results unveil that the sustainability score ascended with the
   recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the highest recycling
   rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63. Conversely, a DWM
   alternative reflecting the `status quo' in China's recycling industry
   has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower than the baseline
   scenario with a 50\% recycling rate. It is worth noting that the `growth
   curve' of the sustainability score continuously flattens as the target
   recycling rate escalates. The increment in recycling rate from the
   `Australian standard' scenario to the optimal scenario is 18.4\%,
   whereas the sustainability score merely increases by 2.3\%, signalling
   that the former scenario arrived at an optimum point for maximising the
   cost-efficiency of DWM under the predefined framework and contexts.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a powerful process for creating
   and managing data throughout the life cycle of a building.
   Traditionally, measuring the well-being of building occupants has been
   addressed solely through objective physical variables such as
   temperature or relative air humidity. However, recent studies indicate
   that the built environment influences subjective aspects of human
   well-being. This article presents a scoping review to find information
   related to the use of BIM in the assessment of the mental and emotional
   state of inhabitants. A scoping review has been undertaken following the
   PRISMA-ScR guidelines by searching in Scopus, ACM, IEEE Xplore and
   PsycINFO databases. Fourteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria
   were found after the screening process, all of them published in the
   last decade, twelve in the last five years. Two ways of using BIM have
   been identified in relation to the subject matter of this review: (i)
   for visualization and monitoring of occupant well-being and (ii) for
   showing building design alternatives to future occupants. The included
   papers show that BIM has potential for assessing the mental and
   emotional state of building occupants. However, the results of these
   studies are still limited and much research in this area remains
   pending.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technology that can
   effectively solve the problems of information dispersion, complex
   personnel management, and lack of construction supervision, which often
   occur during the construction of tunnel engineering. Taking the
   construction of Haicang Tunnel in Xiamen, China as a case study, the
   utilization of BIM technology in the design stage, the construction
   simulation and operation are demonstrated during the full-life cycle of
   the project. During the construction of Haicang Tunnel, the technologies
   of BIM 3D, BIM 4D, BIM 5D, and Cloud Platform are used to make the
   construction process controllable and to facilitate the implementation
   and deployment of construction plans. BIM 3D is a visualization method
   to show the detailed model in the construction. The design is optimized
   by the navigation collision function of BIM 3D. BIM 4D adds the time
   schedule into BIM 3D model to show the construction schedule. BIM 5D
   adds the cost into BIM 4D model to show the construction consumption.
   The methods of BIM 4D and BIM 5D can assist the engineering management
   in allocating resources and funds in the project. Cloud Platform is used
   to effectively implement information management.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a digitalised technology under a
   collaborative working platform. Certain aspects of sustainability have
   been highlighted in recent BIM studies; however, no prior in-depth
   review has focused on BIM standards or guidelines and its uses for
   sustainability. This paper provides a mixed review to determine the
   current state-of-the-art BIM development for sustainability. A
   systematic review approach was adopted to analyse two main sources of
   literature, namely, BIM standards and guidelines; and peer-reviewed
   academic publications. The result reveals that although there has been a
   significant amount of research and development about the use of BIM
   during various project phases, little work has been conducted about how
   it could be applied in refurbishment and demolition. Certain significant
   insights and implications have been uncovered, namely: (a) new BIM tools
   are required for assessing sustainability criteria; (b) the need for
   improved interoperability among BIM software and energy simulation
   tools; (c) BIM uses into various aspects of refurbishment and demolition
   have to be streamlined; and (d) an innovative procurement system is
   needed to adapt social sustainability into the project. (C) 2016

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for several negative impacts on the
   environment, most of them related to nonrenewable energy consumption,
   increasing the concern regarding buildings energy efficiency. In this
   context, computer software has been used to estimate the energy needs of
   the built environment, and the Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   methodology can be used to simplify this process. This study aims to
   validate a BIM-based framework to streamline the energy analysis of
   Portuguese buildings, based on the method of the national regulation for
   the thermal performance of residential buildings. Currently, designers
   need to spend considerable time assessing all the building
   characteristics and performing the mandatory calculations for energy
   performance analysis. It is also intended to link the results of the
   energy simulation with a Building Sustainability Assessment
   method-SBTool(PT)-H. The purpose is to demonstrate how it is possible to
   benefit from this approach to simultaneously improve building
   sustainability during the design stage. To do so, different case studies
   were modelled in Autodesk Revit and exported to a BIM energy tool to
   perform energy simulation analysis. The results were validated against
   the official assessment method of the Portuguese thermal regulation and
   were successfully used to assess the SBTool(PT)-H energy efficiency
   category. The research outcomes provide design teams with a reliable
   BIM-based framework to improve building energy performance and to
   develop thermal projects while enhancing building sustainability. It
   also increases the knowledge about the integration of sustainability
   assessment in the BIM environment, providing new insights for complete
   integration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and off-site manufacturing (OSM)
   approaches have been recognized as revolutionary methods in the
   construction industry. However, limited empirical studies have
   investigated the relations and effects of BIM in OSM projects. Hence,
   this study aims to explore the direct relationship between BIM
   implementation and the performance of OSM projects through their key
   influential factors. The empirical data were collected through
   questionnaires and analyzed using the partial least-squares technique.
   The results show there is a strong relationship between BIM
   implementation and the performance of OSM projects through integration
   management and cooperation behavior. Contract management plays a
   negative moderating effect on the relationship between integration
   management and the performance of OSM projects. These findings provide
   new insights into the detailed implementation strategies for BIM in
   improving OSM projects' performance through their correlated relations.
   This research also contributes to the effective promotion and use of BIM
   and OSM in the construction industry.},

Title = {A BIM-Based Simulation Approach for Life-Cycle Quality Control in
   Post-Pandemic Hospitals},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has engendered extensive challenges for
   conventional hospital operations. To adapt to this problematic issue, a
   mixed-use hospital functioning system for normal and epidemic situations
   is proposed. However, the inherent complexity of a hospital embedded
   with a function of epidemic prevention and control renders a restrained
   construction process that may compromise quality. In this stance, we
   developed a BIM (building information modelling)-based simulation
   approach addressing life-cycle quality control in post-pandemic
   hospitals. An illustrative case study approach, which draws on the grey
   literature, was used to address the research question. BIM forward
   design was employed to integrate with such elements as functional
   streamline, emergency site, and ward conversion in the process of
   transformation from normal to epidemic-related operations. Computational
   fluid dynamics-based fluid simulation was conducted to obtain the most
   suitable air supply and exhaust solutions for negative pressure wards.
   BIM forward design method contributed to improving design efficiency and
   quality. The results of ventilation simulation and environmental
   analysis showed that the design scheme met all the functional
   requirements and technical specifications. Meanwhile, the best pipeline
   synthesis scheme was obtained, which reduced the rework and saved on
   construction time. The proposed method is beneficial to improve the
   efficiency of design information sharing and business collaboration.
   Implications generated from this study can be used as a significant
   reference for the future construction of various healthcare facilities.},

Abstract = {Level of Development specification (LOD) has evolved from a relatively
   obscure technique for cost estimating to an enabling methodology for
   countless interoperable BIM use cases. With the advent of databases and
   automation to both capture LOD requirements based on particular use
   cases and automatic validation of LOD compliance prior to performing use
   cases, the full power of object based LOD is becoming apparent. Within
   this new LOD framework, design progress reporting, quality metrics
   reporting, and design gate control is possible at a BIM object level.
   With the growing value to customers of BIM models as complete life cycle
   tools, and the increasing use of digital devices during construction,
   such as tablets, to view building information, could the end of the
   drawing sheet paradigm be at hand?},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Automatic comparison of time-variant BIM models facilitates value-added
   applications during the building life cycle. This paper addresses a
   solution capable of exploring changes between point clouds and BIMs
   (Scan-vs-BIM) or between time-variant BIMs (BIM-vs-BIM). To this end, a
   change component identification (CCI) algorithm is proposed to determine
   changing states, spatial locations, and semantic information of the
   change components. In that, CCI realizes an object-oriented strategy and
   enables exploration of the local geometry of object shape and comparison
   of object similarity without being limited to specific targets.
   Validations demonstrate the effectiveness of CCI, which achieves an
   accuracy of up to 93\% and 80\% in the BIM-vs-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM cases,
   respectively. The proposed method is expected to improve the automation
   level to document construction progress or confirm discrepancies between
   as-is and as-built BIMs.},

Title = {Review of 10 years research on building energy performance gap:
   Life-cycle and stakeholder perspectives},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {165-181},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The reliability, security, and sustainability of energy generation and
   supply are of global importance and the building sector accounts for up
   to 32\% of total energy consumption, which makes it a key player in the
   domain. Previous research has identified that the actual energy
   consumption in buildings could be as much as 2.5 times of the predicted
   or simulated. This large building energy performance gap (BEPG) between
   the predicted and actual consumption has caused a significant problem
   for building energy supply and demand management and therefore have
   attracted increasing attention from researchers around the world. These
   researches have resulted in a large number of publications over the last
   decade. However, research has not reached the phase where the root
   causes of BEPG could be effectively identified, managed, and eliminated.
   There remains a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the
   current literature to understand the current state of play, and set
   directions for future research. To fill this gap, in this paper, a
   thorough survey and review of BEPG research was carried out. The paper
   collected and analyzed 227 relevant publications and developed a
   framework for better understanding previous BEPG research. Subsequently,
   an in-depth analysis of BEPG research was conducted to explore its
   causes and corresponding strategies (including design concept,
   ``hard{''} technologies and ``soft{''} measures). Not only the
   interaction among causes but also the strengths and limitations of
   corresponding strategies were discussed in detail. Future research is
   finally recommended based on the limitations of exist strategies,
   including (1) building energy performance life-cycle thinking; (2)
   energy performance information integrity; (3) big data collection and
   analytical method; (4) stakeholders' attributions, decision criteria and
   behavior; (5) stakeholder interactions; (6) modelling and simulation
   validation; (7) multidisciplinary approach; and (8) building system
   flexibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the last decades scarcity of resources and global warming have led to
   a more and more efficient building design and usage aimed to reduce
   energy consumption and CO2 emission. For increasing energy efficiency of
   buildings over the whole life cycle analyzing and simulation tools
   became an important technology. For such engineering analyses the use of
   one domain model is mostly not enough. Often, additional information
   coming from other domains are required and have to be combined creating
   an overall information basis and providing the input information for the
   envisaged external simulation tools and their related simulation models.
   These link models are task specific and in the most cases the link
   models differ only slightly regarding the usage of different simulation
   software. So, embedding link models and relating quality checks in a
   context and making them available for a restricted group or even for
   unrestricted use could lead to more reliability.
   In this paper an approach will be presented describing a generic
   framework for efficiently using of link models and quality checks based
   on a certain context definition. As description method for this
   framework an ontology approach is considered linking and consolidating
   the different input sources and creating the base for the quality
   checks.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the advantages offered by embedded sensors
   for cost-effective and environmentally benign product life cycle
   management for desktop computers. During their use by customers as well
   as at the end of their lives, Sensor Embedded Computers (SECs) by virtue
   of sensors embedded in them generate data and information pertaining to
   the conditions and remaining lives of important components such as
   hard-drive, motherboard, and power supply unit. A computer monitoring
   framework is proposed to provide more customer comfort, reduce repair
   costs and increase the effectiveness of current disassembly practices.
   The framework consists of SECs, remote monitoring center (RMC),
   repair/service, disassembly, and disposal centers. The RMC collects
   dynamic data/information generated by sensors during computer usage as
   well as static data/information from the original equipment
   manufacturers (OEMs). The RMC forwards this data/information to the
   repair/service, disassembly, and disposal centers on need-basis. The
   knowledge about the condition and remaining life of computer components
   can be advantageously used for planning repair/service and disassembly
   operations as well as for building refurbished computers with known
   expected lives. Simulation model of the framework is built and is
   evaluated in terms of the following performance measures: average
   downtime of a computer, average repair/service cost of a computer,
   average disassembly cost of a computer, and average life cycle cost of a
   computer. Test results show that embedding sensors in computers provides
   a definite advantage over conventional computers in terms of the
   performance measures.},

Abstract = {The total energy involved in building construction and operation can be
   divided in two parts, Operational Energy and Embodied energy. Many
   researches have focused on simulating operation energy but the embodied
   energy is not much discussed for simulation or alternative selection
   purposes. There are a lot of complex variables that need to be
   quantified and analyzed before any meaningful optimization of embodied
   energy can be achieved. Building Information Model (BIM) is used as a
   platform to hold the data as a context aware, intelligent and
   interactive database This paper discusses the means for realizing the
   embodied energy data in the BIM model through linking the model with
   external database thus laying a foundation for the data exchange and
   retention needed to perform the simulations in the next phase of
   research. Plug-ins are developed to calculate the embodied energy for
   different scenarios. Finally, a case study is conducted of a simplified
   manufacture plant to implement the proposed methodology.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) was created to address the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry's lack of
   collaboration among consultants. Advances in cloud BIM have led to the
   easy exchange of data and real-time collaboration among consultants from
   conceptual design to the detailed construction drawing stage and through
   the project life cycle. This is critical in the development of smart
   cities. Cloud BIM also facilitates visualization of the city and data
   exchange for internet of things (IoT). Smart city development involves
   incorporating data from sensors and hardware attached to existing
   infrastructure. This article studies cloud BIM technology as a means of
   project integration in smart city development. To do this, a case study
   of digital modeling for the development of a smart city was done.
   Benefits include seamless communication, monitoring real-time progress,
   and visualization of files. Problems encountered include governance
   problems, problems preserving work sets, the integrity of drawings, and
   difficulty specifying coordinates on-site.},

Title = {Life cycle inventory regionalization and uncertainty characterization: A
   multilevel modeling approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases are essential to evaluate the
   environmental burden of a product or service using life cycle assessment
   (LCA). The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results
   has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and
   quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is
   proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and
   uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to
   retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between
   the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and
   material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather
   than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The
   uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction
   interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer
   application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states
   from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed
   approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods.
   For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively,
   around 60\% and 80\% of variations within the datasets are explained by
   MLM, and 86.1\% and 96.8\% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the
   MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3\% and 70.5\% when
   traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95\% prediction
   intervals cover more than 95\% of measurement data in both input cases.
   It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for
   future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical
   information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. (c) 2019

Title = {An Empirical Analysis of Barriers to Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) Implementation in Wood Construction Projects: Evidence from the
   Swedish Context},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building information modelling is gradually being recognised by the
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation industry as a
   valuable opportunity to increase the efficiency of the built
   environment. Focusing on the wood construction industry, BIM is becoming
   a necessity; this is due to its high level of prefabrication and complex
   digital procedures using wood sawing machines and sophisticated
   cuttings. However, the full implementation of BIM is still far from
   reality. The main objective of this paper is to explore the barriers
   affecting BIM implementation in the Swedish construction industry. An
   extensive literature review was conducted to extract barriers hindering
   the implementation of BIM in the construction industry. Secondly,
   barriers to the implementation of BIM in the wood construction industry
   in Sweden were extracted using the grounded theory methodology to
   analyse expert input on the phenomenon of low BIM implementation in the
   wood construction industry in Sweden. Thirty-four barriers were
   identified. The analysis of this study also led to the development of a
   conceptual model that recommended solutions to overcome the barriers
   identified to help maximise BIM implementation within the wood
   construction industry. Identifying the main barriers affecting BIM
   implementation is essential to guide organisational decisions and drive
   policy, particularly for governments that are considering articulating
   regulations to expand BIM implementation.},

Abstract = {There is a need for change in Ireland's current decision-making process
   for infrastructure planning and investment, moving away from the
   historic silo-type mentality, where each project is evaluated in
   isolation. This paper proposes the development of a `systems of systems'
   (SoS) methodology for Ireland's national infrastructure planning and
   delivery, using dynamic modelling. Building information modelling offers
   the methodologies and technologies to develop the required digital asset
   database to best inform life cycle decisions associated with conception,
   design, construction and operation of physical infrastructure assets. By
   developing the appropriate digital asset database, the demand for new
   infrastructure can itself be tested, in an SoS methodology, under
   various policy scenarios, to provide evidence for investment decisions.
   Ireland has a poor level of national asset registers and data sets, the
   building blocks for infrastructure network models. This paper evaluates
   the availability of the data sets necessary to develop such a
   methodology.},

   cultural issues, professional and knowledge issues, technological and
   operational issues, cost issues, BIM specific issues, design issues,
   data issues, and information and communication issues. The findings
   highlighted the most significant challenge as the lack of BIM knowledge
   or expertise. Additionally, an important enabler in the design phase is
   the accuracy of data provided by BIM, which enhances project management
   analysis. Finally, the BIM challenges and enablers influence various

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) adoption along with the recent
   emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications provides many unique
   knowledge and decision-making abilities all through the built

   Twin (DT) of the Building Design. The goal of Digital Twins is to
   synchronize the physical world with a virtual platform for seamless
   management and control of the construction process, infrastructure
   solutions, environmental monitoring, and other life span processes
   within building design. Most of the researchers focused on either BIM or
   DT in the construction of building application. In this research work, a
   novel hybrid model of Digital Twin-Building Information Modeling
   (DT-BIM) is proposed. This model does the process of identifying the
   shortage of resources, analyzing requirement, performing decision,
   dispatching the resources, and updating all the process in the database
   with the support of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Hence, this hybrid
   model provides improved results when compared to the implementation of

Abstract = {As the key for building the new power system and achieving the
   ``dual-carbon{''} goal, the development of electric vehicle industry is
   closely connected with the supporting and improvement of charging and
   swapping infrastructure. However, the difficult cost recovery and
   unbalanced regional development appeared due to the low utilization as
   well as nonstandard siting and sizing of charging and swapping
   infrastructure. In order to guide the investment and construction of
   charging and swapping infrastructure correctly and effectively, it is
   essential to conduct in-depth research with respect to siting and sizing
   of charging and swapping infrastructure at this stage. On the basis of
   Particle Swarm Optimization, this paper builds an optimization model of
   siting and sizing for the fast charging stations through dividing
   regions in accordance with the charging demand of electric taxi, the
   geographical information of inapplicable location and other factors. The
   case result indicates that the model proposed herein is capable of
   improving economic benefits of investment operators and guiding the
   investment and construction of AC charging piles by means of maximizing
   the net income of the charging station throughout full life cycle, and
   determining the geographic location of charging stations and the
   quantities of charging piles to be configured. After optimizing the
   location of charging stations, it can maximize life-cycle net incomes of
   675.86 million yuan and determine the optimized amounts of charging
   piles in each charing station are 159, 339 and 563, respectively.},

Abstract = {To promote the construction of a digital mine and facilitate sharing of
   mining engineering information throughout its life cycle, a basic
   framework of the mine working information model is designed and
   constructed after fully considering the object and information
   constitution during all phases. The basic composition of the information
   model is defined, and the information model is elaborated on geometric
   and attributive aspects based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   standard. In this study, the mine working unit is considered as the
   instantiation object of the information model, combined with the
   characteristics of the mine working structure and the spatial structure
   expression. The relationship between the entire system and the
   components of the mine working unit are established. By expanding on the
   classic building information modeling (BIM), a mine working information
   model based on the IFC standards is constructed, which provides a
   reference for the extension of BIM technology in the field of mining
   engineering.},

Abstract = {Modern aviation industry is a complex large-scale system that includes
   designing, testing, production, operation, maintains services, etc.
   Thus, it seems reasonable to provide information logistical support
   throughout the life cycle of single processes in this area. On the other
   hand, it allows building stochastic models to manage aviation industry
   in real-time mode under uncertainties and risks conditions. It is
   possible to apply this approach by using Big Data concept. The
   multi-agent method has been suggested to build the Markov decision
   process system model of the airline industry life cycle. For discovering
   the main control action to reduce costs of an airline company, the
   theoretic-information approach has been applied. The results of the
   analysis determine the agent action during the decision process to
   control the amount of freight related to fuel consumption.},

Abstract = {Buildings consume a tremendous amount of the total use of secondary
   energy resulting in a considerable impact on the environment. Therefore,
   it is necessary to reduce their energy consumption by improving the
   design of new buildings or renovating existing buildings. However,
   renovating building envelopes and energy systems to lessen energy losses
   is usually expensive and has a long payback period. Despite the
   significant contribution of the research about optimizing energy
   consumption, there is limited research focusing on the renovation of
   existing buildings to minimize their environmental impact using Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA). This study aims to develop a methodology to
   optimize the energy performance of existing buildings by selecting the
   optimal renovation strategies considering LCA. Different scenarios can
   be combined in a building renovation strategy to improve energy
   efficiency. Each scenario considers several factors including
   improvement of the building envelopes, Heating, Ventilation, and Air
   Conditioning (HVAC) systems, and local energy generation systems.
   However, some of these scenarios could be inconsistent and should be
   eliminated. Another consideration in this research is the appropriate
   coupling of renovation scenarios. For example, the HVAC system must be
   redesigned when renovating the building envelope to consider the reduced
   energy demand and to avoid undesirable side effects. A genetic algorithm
   (GA) coupled with an energy simulation tool is used for simultaneously
   minimizing the energy consumption and the LCA of the building. The
   simulation tool is used to calculate the energy consumption for each
   potential solution representing one renovation scenario. The data of the
   building characteristics are extracted from the Building Information
   Model (BIM). The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated
   using a case study focusing on the buildings of Concordia University.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a key part of the Internet of Things
   vision which aims at bridging together the physical and the digital
   worlds in several application domains. In the building automation field,
   WSNs are widely adopted for energy optimization, safety and security
   purposes, and could greatly benefit from existing information already
   available in preexisting building information models (BIMs). Such BIMs
   are normally developed during the building design phase and reused
   continuously during the construction and operation phases of the
   building life-cycle. In current deployments, however, due to lack of
   interoperability such information (e.g., walls geometry, materials, and
   so on) must often be recollected and reinputed by WSN commissioning
   specialists. Open development and planning tools and methodologies can
   play a key role in fostering interoperability and convergence of BIM and
   WSN systems. This paper aims at demonstrating how increased
   interoperability between WSN development-support tools and BIM systems
   could provide advantages to developers, integrators, domain specialist,
   and BIM users. The methodology is validated by applying a newly proposed
   tool exploiting BIM interoperability to support the planning of the
   topology of a WSN based on ultrawideband technologies. The proposed
   approach is evaluated through a small-scale experimentation held in a
   historical building in Torino (Italy).},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) ist derzeit einer der am meisten
   diskutierten Begriffe der Bau- und Immobilienbranche. Auch im
   Facility-Management (FM) gewinnt der Einsatz von BIM immer mehr an
   Bedeutung. Das Ziel eines integrierten BIM-Prozesses stellt ein
   digitales Gebaudemodell dar, in dem alle erforderlichen Daten des
   gesamten Lebenszyklus enthalten und zuganglich sind. Eine Grundlage fur
   den Datenaustausch bilden die Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), ein
   offener Standard zur Verbesserung der Interoperabilitat von
   Planungsprozessen in der Bau- und Immobilienbranche. Auf IFC basieren
   weitere Schnittstellenstandards wie COBie und CAFM-Connect. Sowohl IFC
   als auch COBie und CAFM-Connect ermoglichen eine ubertragung von
   Bestandsdaten aus der Planungs- und Ausfuhrungsphase in Systeme des
   Facility-Managements. Die Prozessdaten sowie die Historisierung der
   Prozessdaten, die im Rahmen des Facility-Managements entstehen, spielen
   jedoch in den vorgenannten Standards derzeit keine Rolle. Um ein
   vollstandiges digitales Gebaudemodell uber den gesamten Lebenszyklus zu
   erhalten, muss der IFC-Standard um weitere Property Sets zu Prozessdaten
   erweitert werden. Diese Property Sets enthalten sowohl Auftragsdaten,
   die durch den Auftraggeber definiert werden, als auch Zustands- und
   Verbrauchsdaten, die durch das FM generiert werden. Diese Daten konnen
   nach deren Erfassung nicht nur ausgewertet, sondern auch ohne
   Medienbruch an weitere Dienstleister im Rahmen des digitalen
   Gebaudemodells ubergeben werden.
   Abstract Integration of FM-process data in a virtual building model
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently one of the most
   discussed terms in the construction and real estate industry. In
   Facility Management (FM), the use of BIM is also gaining in importance.
   The aim of an integrated BIM process is to create a digital building
   model where all necessary data of the entire life cycle are integrated
   and accessible for users. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), an open
   standard for improving the interoperability of planning processes in the
   construction and real estate industry, is the basis for data exchange.
   Other standards such as COBie and CAFM-Connect are based on IFC. IFC,
   COBie as well as CAFM-Connect enable the transfer of inventory data from
   the planning and construction phase to facility management systems. The
   process data and the historicization of the process data that arise in
   the context of facility management are currently of no importance in the
   prementioned standards. In order to obtain a complete digital virtual
   building model over the entire life cycle, it is therefore necessary to
   extend the IFC standard to include further property sets that contain
   process data. These property sets contain order data defined by the
   customer as well as data on status and consumption generated by FM. This
   historicization data can then not only be evaluated after it has been
   recorded, but it can also be transferred to other service providers
   within the framework of the digital virtual building model without media
   discontinuity.},

Title = {The impact of BIM-based integration management on megaproject
   performance in China},
Journal = {ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {34-43},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of the global economy, the investment boom in
   megaprojects worldwide has been on the rise in the past several decades.
   As large temporary contract organizations, megaprojects are generally
   confronted with performance dilemmas. The managerial advantage of
   building information modeling (BIM) has been recognized as one of the
   critical factors for the success of megaprojects. In particular,
   BIM-based integration management (BIM IM) signifies the logical and
   reasonable coordination and integration of the required processes during
   the whole life-cycle of projects, which facilitates the implementation
   and management of megaprojects. However, limited empirical research has
   explored effective pathways for BIM IM in improving megaproject
   performance (MP). Thus, this study establishes a novel conceptual
   framework to explore the impacts of BIM IM on MP through information
   sharing (IS) and cooperation behavior (CB), as well as considering the
   moderating effects of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and task
   conflict (TC). The empirical data were collected in megaprojects in
   China using the questionnaire survey, and data from 206 middle-senior
   managers was analyzed by structural equation modeling partial
   least-squares method. The research findings reveal the effectiveness of
   BIM IM in promoting IS and CB in megaprojects for ultimate MP. More
   specifically, BIM IM has a larger effect on IS than CB, and CB has a
   more profound impact on MP than IS. Meanwhile, TMT heterogeneity plays a
   negative moderating effect on the relationship between IS and MP, while
   TC shows a positive moderating effect on the relationship between CB and
   MP. The findings of this study provide new perspectives and practical
   strategies for stakeholders to support the effective use of BIM IM to
   achieve strategic management in megaprojects worldwide.},

Title = {Towards product-level parallel computing of large-scale building
   information modeling data using graph theory},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) upgrades the digitization of
   buildings from 2D to 3D and has become a common paradigm in
   architecture, engineering, construction, operation, and facility
   management (AECO/FM) industry. Many studies have argued that the volume
   of BIM keeps increasing and becomes extremely large as projects proceed.
   However, processing large-scale BIM data in parallel is still an open
   issue due to the complicated reference relationships in a BIM. This
   study addresses this issue by introducing graph theory. Firstly, a novel
   directed reference graph (DrGraph) model is proposed to capture the
   reference relationships among BIM instances according to the Industrial
   Foundation Classes (IFC) specification. On top of DrGraph, BIM product
   slice (ProSlice) model is developed to split the original IFC file into
   small independent IFC slices in product level. Since the generated
   slices are independent of each other, they can be dispatched and
   computed in a parallel computing cluster. The usage of ProSlice in
   MapReduce is illustrated using the BIM triangulation task. Finally,
   experimental results show that our proposed product-level parallel
   computing scheme has a better performance in both computation efficiency
   and internal memory usage than floor-level ones, and that parallel
   computing scales the computation of BIM data. Our product-level parallel
   computing scheme can also envision other geometric data processing and
   semantic data analysis of large-scale BIM data.},

Abstract = {Today, many construction operations have incorporated automated
   equipment, means, and methods into their regular practises. Although
   adaption of automation in the building construction sector has been
   slow, principles of industrial automation are applicable to this domain,
   both to building construction, civil engineering, and to prefabrication
   of construction components. Improved sensor technologies and the
   widening use of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) will offer new
   possibilities to cover various needs and operations taking place
   throughout the building life cycle. These can play a key role in future
   construction automation. This paper provides a survey for potential
   sensor technologies for building construction automation, highlighting
   their potential also with contributions from robotics. The paper carries
   out the survey from the viewpoints of building construction phases. (C)

Abstract = {This study examines the utility of descriptive statistics and factor
   analysis in the interpretation of an LCA data set. It is believed that
   the use of descriptive statistics and factor analysis provides a
   comprehensive summary of the data, and insight on internal validity,
   which improves interpretation of results. The current study also
   provides a pretext for subsequent analyses with inferential statistics.
   Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five
   service life models (N = 45, 45 data points). Three environmental
   indicators were used to characterize the data: global warming potential
   (GWP), atmospheric eco-toxicity (ECO), and atmospheric acidification
   (ACID) from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and
   Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) assessment method. Descriptive
   statistics measured minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation,
   skewness, and kurtosis. For the factor analysis, data were disaggregated
   according to nine variables, including cumulative life cycle impact,
   major replacement, major replacement (frequency), minor replacement,
   major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2, and total
   transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). All statistical operations
   were performed using SPSS software.
   Descriptive statistics show a relatively normal data distribution for
   GWP. Data distributions for ECO and ACID deviated slightly from normal,
   which was confirmed through Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
   Factor analysis resulted in three factors for GWP and ECO, and two
   factors for ACID. In each analysis, cumulative life cycle impact, major
   replacement, and major replacement (frequency) aligned as variables in a
   common factor. This alignment corroborates previous findings. Other
   variables in the factor analysis were less clearly or inconsistently
   aligned.
   The descriptive statistics provide important information about the
   distribution of data in the study. The data are determined to be
   suitable for further analysis using inferential univariate and
   multivariate statistical tests, a topic that is examined in part 2 of
   this study as reported by Grant et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess, 2015).
   The factor analysis used in the study corroborates the conclusions of
   previous studies and provides a basis for future statistical analyses.},

   investigate the challenges in implementing building information
   modelling (BIM) for FM in government buildings in
   Thailand.Design/methodology/approachEight government-building facility
   experts were interviewed using an in-depth interview method to identify
   FM challenges. The collected qualitative data were analysed via thematic
   analysis to ensure data saturation. The final questionnaire was designed
   with 45 FM problems, classified into management, technical and human
   resource problems, to collect quantitative data from 54 government FM
   officers. The data were used to prioritise the severity and frequency of
   the FM problems using the severity index (SI) and relative importance
   index (RII).FindingsManagement problems have the highest impact, with an
   average SI of 0.285, followed by human resource (average SI = 0.266) and
   technical (average SI = 0.264) problems.Originality/valueThis study
   identifies the government-building FM problems in Thailand that are
   critical to the development of a BIM execution plan (BEP) guideline. The
   findings can facilitate strategy development for government-building
   operations and management in line with the public procurement and supply
   administration of Thailand. These findings can serve as a guideline to
   inform the development of a BIM Roadmap for integration into the
   national digital roadmap and the Thailand 4.0 policy to mitigate
   construction-related environmental and climate issues.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is today one of the most promising
   approaches to achieve digitalization in the construction industry over
   the complete building life cycle. Meanwhile most of the projects in
   research, industry or public authorities focus on the planning or
   construction phase, the practical usage of BIM in operational phase
   within Facility Management (FM) is still rare. Despite of the well
   agreed benefits of using BIM in the operations to improve maintenance
   planning and control, ensure speed up of FM hand over from construction
   or improve start-up management of building operations to name three of
   them, serious obstacles for practical use of BIM in FM must be
   considered. Just to mention two of them, today accepted standards
   helping FM organization to setup their BIM requirements according to
   different BIM uses are missing or As-Built information of existing
   buildings to setup digital building model needed for BIM are not
   available.
   The lack of exiting (3D) digital building models in FM will not change
   quickly; far more the 90 \% of the buildings to be operated and
   maintained in FM business are existing buildings. The acquisition of
   As-Built information may be simplified by digital surveying methods
   (e.g. 3D Laser Scanning, Aerial photo capturing by Surveying Drone), but
   there is still an enormous amount of effort for parametric modelling
   needed to setup digital building models for FM, which cannot be achieved
   by typical FM organizations today.
   This paper extents first results of the research project BIM-FM
   presented on INservFM in 2017 comparing different digital surveying
   technologies used in field tests and to optimize workflow to make
   digital building models of existing buildings available for FM purposes.
   In order to give FM organization access to BIM data over a long period
   of building operation, new concepts of data management based on semantic
   web technologies to link BIM data to existing alphanumeric information
   located in Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) systems be
   discussed.},

   Structures Using Terrestrial Laser Scanning},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to the accumulation of manufacturing errors of components and
   construction errors, there are always deviations between an as-built
   complex tubular engineering structure (CTES) and its as-designed model.
   As terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides accurate point cloud data
   (PCD) for scanned objects, it can be used in the building information
   modeling (BIM) reconstruction of as-built CTESs for life cycle
   management. However, few studies have focused on the BIM reconstruction
   of a full-scale CTES from missing and noisy PCD. To this end, this study
   proposes an automated BIM reconstruction method based on the TLS for a
   full-scale CTES. In particular, a novel algorithm is proposed to extract
   the central axis of a tubular structure. An extended axis searching
   algorithm is applied to segment each component PCD. A slice-based method
   is used to estimate the geometric parameters of curved tubes. The
   proposed method is validated through a full-scale CTES, where the
   maximum error is 0.92 mm.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Substantial research has been performed on the data standards and
   exchanges in the Architectural, Engineering, Construction/Facility
   Management (AEC/FM) industry over the past several years. The growing
   popularity of building information modeling (BIM) technology is based
   heavily upon the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse
   of information during a project life cycle. Although many researchers
   and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and
   benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted,
   and what factors enhance implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and
   use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. Therefore,
   we propose an acceptance model for BIM in construction organizations
   using structural equation modeling (SEM). The key components, including
   the BIM acceptance model (BAM), are identified through a literature
   review about technology acceptance-behavior related theories, and was
   then consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in
   the construction industry. Based on the components, a questionnaire was
   designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as
   contractors, architects, construction managers, and engineers) in South
   Korea. A total of 114 completed questionnaires were retrieved. We used
   SEM for hypothesis testing. The validated BAM can serve as a foundation
   for positioning and comparing BIM acceptance research and provides users
   with a framework for evaluating BIM acceptance.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes have continued to gain
   relevance in the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
   industry with more resources directed toward it. This study conducts a
   bibliometric analysis of 445 BIM articles to investigate and understand
   the pattern of BIM research which include defining BIM research
   categories, evaluating the project sectors that are influenced by BIM,
   and tracking the funding structure of BIM research. A network map that
   displays a visualization of the structure of BIM literature by research
   origin, funding structure and geographical scope was designed. None of
   the previous reviews of literature analyzed the BIM articles' corpus to
   such level and depth. The findings revealed research categories such as
   construction and project management and BIM learning, adoption \&
   practice as the core research areas in BIM and highlighted trending
   research themes in BIM research. Authors based in Asia and Europe
   received more research grants than their counterparts in other regions;
   likewise, two-third of the articles was authored by academics in the
   United States, Korea, and the United Kingdom. The study provides its
   readers with relevant research areas that require considerations, and
   the discussion of selected research areas provides an extensive
   understanding of salient BIM fields.},

Abstract = {The Higher Education Institutions' (HEI) asset portfolio include a
   diverse range of buildings with different characteristics, economic
   life, rehabilitation and maintenance costs, and mission criticality. All
   such information is to be integrated in support of a rational and highly
   informed decision-making process within a resource-constrained
   environment in the context of facilities management (FM). This process
   needs to build upon accurate, reliable, and timely information about
   various building systems, components, and component elements of the
   individual buildings-which comes from a variety of sources. Delivering
   information in a segregated manner, traditional FM tools fall short in
   providing requirements effectively. Building information models (BIM),
   capable of capturing and integrating such large information databases,
   has recently been recognized as a compelling tool for project life-cycle
   analysis. This study is the first phase of a series of research on a
   BIM-intensive information management framework to support FM
   decision-making in HEIs. Four main aspects of building FM are
   investigated as inputs to the framework; institutions' asset portfolio,
   FM practice, FM information requirements, and employed information
   technology (IT) tools. Information requirements are classified into four
   main categories: attributes of the physical facility, operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) data, institutional factors, and decision
   alternatives. This information can be captured, stored, retrieved or
   exchanged in multiple software packages by integrating BIMs and building
   operation information exchange systems within the FM framework.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},

Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The construction sector generates large amounts of heterogeneous and
   dynamic data characterized by their fragmentation throughout the life
   cycle of a project. Immediate and accurate access to that data is
   fundamental to the management, decision-making and analysis by
   construction owners, supervisors, managers, and technicians involved in
   the different phases of the project life cycle. However, since
   construction project data are diverse, dispersed, uncorrelated, and
   difficult to visualize, a reliable basis for decision-making can rarely
   be established by the management team. Aiming to bridge this gap, a
   methodology for data management during building construction by means of
   Data with BIM and Business Intelligence (BI) analysis tools was
   developed in this study. This methodology works by extracting data from
   3D parametric model and integrating it with a BI tool, through which
   data are visualized and interrelated with the same database, the BIM
   model. To demonstrate the applicability of the methodology, a study case
   was carried out. It was shown that this methodology provides a
   collaborative platform for accurate data analysis to the construction
   management and supervision teams, allowing project stakeholders to
   access and update data in real-time, in permanent linkage with the BIM
   model. Additionally, improving the reliability of the decision-making
   process and ensuring project deliverability, the developed methodology
   contributes to a more sustainable management process by decreasing
   errors and resource consumption, including energy. Therefore, the main
   goal of this study is to present a methodology for data analysis with
   BIM models integrated with BI for sustainable construction management.},

Abstract = {Interoperability of information systems is partially resolved due to
   many standards such as networks protocols, XML derived languages and
   object oriented programming. Nevertheless, semantic heterogeneity limits
   collaborative works and interoperability. Despite ontology and other
   semantic technics, the binding of heterogeneous information systems
   requires new technics of managing and displaying information according
   to the semantic representation of each stakeholder of the collaboration.
   In this paper we addressed the problem of merging geographical
   information systems and building information model. The way to achieve
   this goal must solve several heterogeneity problems due to the data life
   cycle, the data temporality, the binding between 2D geo-referenced
   modelling and 3D geometric models or problem of scalability for
   real-time 3D display from remote server for managing a real environment
   of several million m2. To bridge this gap, we present a new architecture
   based on a semantic multi-representation of heterogeneous information.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the nature and evolution of
   online communities in the early stages of their life cycles. The authors
   analyze the topics of discussions in an online community to identify
   issues related to community development. The authors also compare the
   topics of exemplary questions that founding members believed to be asked
   with the real questions based on members' information needs.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors use Medical Sciences Stack
   Exchange, a health Q\&A community of Stack Exchange, which requires four
   stages of development: definition, commitment, private beta and public
   beta. The authors collect postings of discussions and health questions
   in the first three stages, perform a content analysis of the postings
   and analyze the topics of discussions and health questions. Findings The
   authors find that the topics of discussions evolved dynamically with the
   issues of community governance, role as a medical/health community,
   members and roles, content management, quality control and community
   design. The authors also find that the real questions included more
   specific and diverse issues than the exemplary questions that founding
   members expected. Originality/value Theoretically, this study tests the
   community life cycle model in an online community that has explicit
   phase markers. The findings could shed light on community development
   and help prioritize issues to solve and decisions to make in its early
   stages. Additionally, this study focuses on the challenges and concerns
   in online health community building and solutions generated by
   collective efforts that could influence health communications in online
   communities.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a novel building information model
   (BIM)-building performance model (BPM)-building environmental model
   (BEM) framework to identify the most energy-efficient and cost-effective
   strategies for the renovation of existing education buildings to achieve
   the nearly zero-energy goal while minimizing the environmental impact. A
   case building, the University of Maryland's Architecture Building, was
   used to demonstrate the validity of the framework and a set of building
   performance indicatorsincluding energy performance, environmental
   impacts, and occupant satisfactionwere used to evaluate renovation
   strategies. Additionally, this novel framework further demonstrated the
   interoperability among different digital tools and platforms. Lastly,
   following a detailed analysis and measurements, the case study results
   highlighted a particular energy profile as well as the retrofit needs of
   education buildings. Eight different renovation packages were analyzed
   with the top-ranking package indicating an energy saving of 62\%, carbon
   emissions reduction of 84\%, and long-term cost savings of 53\%, albeit
   with a relatively high initial cost. The most preferable package ranked
   second in all categories, with a moderate initial cost.},

Abstract = {A vital task of this millennium is to protect the existing heritage,
   also through the adoption of resilient management systems. In this
   framework, the organization of knowledge remains one of the critical
   points. For this reason, new methodologies and cross-disciplinary
   technologies are increasingly being chosen to optimize resources toward
   more sustainable interventions. Therefore, the ability to model the
   building geometry and behavior must be maximized through interoperable
   processes between Building Information Modeling and Finite Element
   Modeling methods aimed at the seismic vulnerability assessment. Setting
   up an integrated digitalization process is undoubtedly challenging
   initially but returns more significant benefits during the
   infrastructure life cycle. The interoperability tests' bi-directionality
   is essential for constantly evaluating activities to update data
   following facilities' modifications. The Modal Assurance Criterion
   indicator is used to assess the coherence of the models after possible
   simplifications introduced for non-linear state analyses.},

Abstract = {A non destructive testing process is becoming a technical need,
   thousands of buildings and huge urban areas will have to be adapted to
   restrictive energy-saving standards and sustainability criteria.
   Analysis and diagnostics are required on a massive scale. Building
   Information Modeling seems to be the adequate environment to assemble
   huge amounts of data. At this moment both hardware and software
   technologies are performing moderately well separately. The challenge is
   to connect them and in the long run automate data collection and
   conversion to a unified model that could be maintained during the
   programmed building life cycle. The aim of this research is to discuss
   the challenge of NDT hardware and BIM software systems integration and
   define the basic steps for the best practices to undertake it in a fast
   and accurate manner as well as to define the present and future
   connections to be developed. A 3 phase joint research project is
   proposed here and basic needs are analysed. Many lessons have been
   learned from field work, data translation and data incompatibilities
   with many shortcomings being detected.},

Abstract = {Despite the fast development of building information modeling (BIM) and
   its associated benefits, the adoption of BIM in stormwater drainage
   projects is still at its early stage. In this paper, the latest drainage
   design modeling standards and practices of 10 state departments of
   transportation in the US were reviewed. Furthermore, the
   interoperability between drainage models and industry foundation classes
   (IFC)-the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard
   for BIM was studied. It was found that although the state-of-the-art
   drainage modeling software can support interoperability with IFC, there
   are research gaps to be addressed to achieve seamless interoperability
   such as the lack of distinction in IFC entities for representing
   different drainage components (e.g., inlet, conduit, etc.). Solutions to
   fill the gaps were proposed such as consistent and comprehensive
   modeling standards/protocols and automated classification for drainage
   components leveraging invariant signatures, to support the life-cycle
   management of transportation infrastructure projects with BIM.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The development of super high-rise building projects has become crucial
   for mitigating land shortages in rapidly growing urban areas. Super
   high-rise steel structures, particularly RC core wall-steel frame
   systems, have become the preferred choice due to their superior
   performance, high prefabrication level, and construction efficiency.
   Despite their benefits, super high-rise buildings face challenges
   related to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions. Consequently,
   it is important to analyze the carbon emissions of these buildings
   throughout their lifecycle and propose low-carbon construction
   strategies. A carbon emission analysis focused on super high-rise
   buildings with RC core wall-steel frame structures is conducted in this
   study. A carbon emission analysis model is constructed based on
   BIM-enabled LCA through a real-world case study. The emission factor
   method is combined with the BIM model to calculate carbon emission.
   Furthermore, carbon emissions across various construction strategies are
   compared, with a particular focus on the manufacturing processes of the
   main materials. The results indicate that incorporating admixtures in
   concrete, along with adopting the electric arc furnace (EAF) method and
   utilizing recycled scrap steel in steel manufacturing, significantly
   reduces the carbon emissions of the buildings. Lastly, effective
   low-carbon approaches for these buildings are proposed.},

Abstract = {Information on lead redistribution and speciation changes in
   anthrosphere can help to analyze the whole lead cycle on the earth. Lead
   life cycle was traced based on the concepts of anthropogenic transfer
   and transformation. Lead transfer and the distribution of chemical
   species throughout the anthropogenic flow were identified in 2010 in
   China. The results show that 1.85 Mt lead ore was consumed (besides
   1.287 Mt imported concentrated ore and 1.39 Mt lead scraps. After
   undergoing transformations, 3.53 Mt lead entered end services in
   chemical species of Pb, PbO2 and PbSO4, altogether accounting for over
   80\% of the total lead products. Finally, 2.10 Mt ore was emitted into
   the environment in such species as PbSO4 (26\%), PbO (19\%) and Pb
   (15\%). Lead transfer begins in primary raw material sectors, and then
   transfers to manufacturing sectors. Lead provides services mainly in
   such industrial sectors as transportation, electrical power and
   buildings or construction.},

Abstract = {Formation of the digital economy is the main direction of many
   countries' development and the trend of the whole world's economic
   development. According to research results, a low level of
   digitalization in the construction industry is noted. The construction
   industry is a significant part of the world economy. Construction makes
   up 13\% of the world's GDP. Such scales of the industry allow us to
   conclude that its digitalization can bring considerable results. The
   basis of digitalization in construction is the application of building
   information modeling (BIM) at all stages of a real estate object life
   cycle. This research is devoted to studying the conditions and methods
   of the assessment of cost efficiency of BIM application at the real
   estate object maintenance stage. The method of calculation of the
   managing company savings from the application of an information model
   during real estate object maintenance is offered as the result of the
   research. The author analyzed various models of maintenance performance
   for the specification of the offered calculation procedure. The main
   direction of receiving the budget funds economy in a managing company is
   the reduction of time spent on the corresponding works and,
   respectively, the reduction of financial expenses connected with the
   compensation. Also, BIM application during construction leads to a
   decrease in the number of breakages of the engineering equipment at the
   maintenance stage. This means that the economy of material inputs will
   take place.},

Abstract = {Information exchange between domain-specific software products is
   essential for capturing the life cycle information of a building from
   its inception to operation. To collect all specialized information
   within a single model requires a platform that is acceptable to all
   different software tools. Many researchers have suggested that this
   objective can be approached by using vendor-neutral and open building
   information models such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to
   capture and exchange data. To analyze the effectiveness of the IFC
   model, this paper presents a data exchange analysis between two of the
   most popular BIM software to date: Revit and Tekla. Models are exchanged
   in the two software using IFC and a comparison is made in terms of data
   loss and misrepresentation. Revit seems to process IFC data easily
   however minor changes are noticed during the exchange. Tekla needs
   conversion procedures before IFC data can be processed. The
   architectural features of the model are found to be seriously
   misrepresented in Tekla.},

Title = {Accelerating Building Energy Retrofitting with BIM-Enabled BREEAM-NL
   Assessment},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Paris Agreement requires building retrofitting practices to be more
   efficient and effective. However, the current practice for building
   energy retrofitting is lacking behind, and one reason for that is the
   time-consuming process of energy credit evaluation. Energy performance
   assessment such as BREEAM-NL in the Netherlands could apply a more
   automatic approach with the help of building information modelling (BIM)
   for an efficient building energy retrofitting evaluation process.
   However, to what extent BIM can help in accelerating energy performance
   evaluation in the BREEAM-NL certification process is under-examined.
   This paper first combines literature findings with practical interviews
   from a case study organization to present a holistic overview of the
   potential for automating energy-related credits evaluation in BREEAM-NL
   using BIM. To understand the possible impacts of such transition, a
   responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) matrix is
   developed to map the impacts on different actors involved. Furthermore,
   to help practitioners in an organizational context to adopt a
   BIM-enabled energy credits assessment workflow, the case study
   organization is studied to (1) understand their current BIM use status;
   (2) propose a suitable starting point to take toward a BIM-enabled
   energy performance assessment for building energy retrofitting. Finally,
   the proposed starting point is demonstrated using a customized
   application, and the project team's feedback is used to verify its
   efficiency and future directions are identified.},

Title = {A conceptual approach to track design changes within a

Abstract = {Successful management of design changes is critical for the efficient
   delivery of construction projects. Building information modeling (BIM)
   is envisioned to play an important role in integrating design,
   construction and facility management processes through coordinated
   changes throughout the project life-cycle. BIM currently provides
   significant benefits in coordinating changes across different views in a
   single model, and identifying conflicts between different
   discipline-specific models. However, current BIM tools provide limited
   support in managing changes across several discipline-specific models.
   This paper describes an approach to represent, coordinate, and track
   changes within a collaborative multi-disciplinary BIM environment. This
   approach was informed by a detailed case study of a large, complex,
   fast-tracked BIM project where we investigated numerous design changes,
   analyzed change management processes, and evaluated existing BIM tools.
   Our approach characterizes design changes in an ontology to represent
   changed component attributes, dependencies between components, and
   change impacts. It explores different types of dependencies amongst
   different design changes and describes how a graph-based approach and
   dependency matrix could assist with automating the propagation and
   impact of changes in a BIM-based project delivery process.},

Title = {Ontology of the Communication Performance Prospects of Building
   Information Modelling Adoption among Project Teams in Construction
   Project Delivery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-43},
Abstract = {The need for improved communication performance among project teams has
   significantly underlined the increased adoption of many computer-based
   tools and information communication technology (ICT) in project delivery
   in the construction industry. Though the literature has espoused the key
   benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM), relatively less
   attention has been paid to the communication performance influence of
   BIM to profession-specific tasks and wider industry adoption. The
   primary aim of this study is to assess the communication performance
   prospects of BIM adoption among project teams in construction project
   delivery. Using deductive research design, a structured questionnaire
   survey was conducted on 52 experienced construction industry
   practitioners in the use of BIM tools in project delivery. The results
   indicated a significant influence of BIM adoption to accuracy,
   understanding, timeliness and improvement in the dissemination of shared
   project related information among project teams. However, contrary to
   opinion espoused in literature, there was no significant impact on
   overcoming underloading, overloading and gatekeeping issues in
   communicated information among the team. The findings provide empirical
   support into the perceived communication benefits of BIM adoption and
   thus this knowledge can be an overriding impetus to extensive adoption
   of BIM tools across all the project life cycle to enhance communication
   in the construction industry.},

Title = {Feature selection for indoor temperature prediction in large-space
   buildings based on transfer entropy and life cycle cost},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Indoor temperature prediction as an essential reference for heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system tuning has boomed in
   recent years, with the development of information technology. But for
   data-driven techniques, inputs as key factors in prediction accuracy,
   learning efficiency and generalization capacity, did not pay enough
   attention. Existing research focused only on prediction accuracy by
   copying previous practices in other fields like medicine and hydrology,
   without considering prediction horizons and economic costs, which is
   meaningless and even may mislead the configuration of the monitoring
   system, especially for large-space buildings with long-span space,
   diverse zones and coupling parameters. In this work, a novel hybrid
   feature selection technique for indoor temperature prediction was
   developed. Herein, transfer entropy (TE) was introduced into filter to
   evaluate importance of features, where Max-min TE as a gauge was defined
   to cope with time delays in HVAC system; Then gated recurrent network
   was taken in wrapper as a bridge to transform evaluations in filter into
   contributions to prediction; Lastly, life cycle cost was employed as a
   referee to judge cost-efficient alternatives. The proposed technique was
   validated by time-series data collected from a library and system energy
   consumption baseline simulated with TRNSYS to suggest optimal feature
   subsets under different prediction horizons.},

Abstract = {In order to accurately analyze the building energy consumption and
   identify the problem of building energy consumption in advance, this
   study carries out the energy consumption analysis based on BIM (Building
   Information Modeling). The research object is a four-story college
   student dormitory in Beijing, and this set of BIM-based energy
   consumption simulation data was obtained using standard operating
   procedures (SOP). This operating procedure can start energy consumption
   analysis in the conceptual design stage, and developers can participate
   in real-time through the use of a three-dimensional information model,
   without additional design required. Then, comparing this study with the
   traditional energy consumption analysis, we see that the SOP of this
   research result has the following advantages: SOP function analysis is
   more professional, and the visual display method is more popular and
   intuitive; due to the flexible file format of the SOP, when data
   exchange is required between different software, the SOP can realize
   more convenient operation, and users can identify problems in the early
   stage of design through the SOP, correcting the scheme according to the
   simulation results, which is conducive to the development of the
   construction process. Finally, this study puts forward the analysis and
   estimation of energy consumption in different stages of the building
   life cycle, so as to provide researchers with ideas for improvement.},

Abstract = {The building industry is embedded in a complex web of relationships that
   affect building processes and life cycles such as modeling, simulation,
   monitoring, evaluation, and optimization. Effective mapping of relevant
   contextual attributes onto available building industry information and
   services has a formidable potential to improve the AEC processes. In
   this context, the semantic Web and Linked Data technologies have the
   potential to address the interoperability issues and to link diverse
   information models in AEC domain. Recently, there have been a number of
   research works on applying Linked Data principles to information
   integration use-cases; however, the current approaches are generally
   based on data conversion and federated repositories that in addition to
   information lost in conversion roundtrips, are also not well-suited for
   dynamic building models and ubiquitous data integration use-cases. In
   this paper an alternative method for interlinking of BIM models is
   presented that unlike the existing approaches, avoids the unnecessary
   data conversions and instead employs the Semantic Web technologies to
   provide a dynamic access mechanism to original models.},

Abstract = {Modular construction has the potential to increase the efficiency of
   on-site construction activities, as well as reduce capital costs,
   project duration, and construction waste. However, currently, critical
   issues in the design and pre-planning phases including longer lead-in
   time, lack of expertise, and flexibility of design hinder its extensive
   deployment in the AEC industries. To this end, this paper proposes a new
   methodology for automated generation and configuration of a modular
   building design by deploying generative adversarial network (GAN) and
   building information modeling (BIM) technologies. This paper focuses on
   spatial design in the early design phase. By incorporating the
   requirements and constraints of a modular building project needed for
   its life cycle into the automated design process, the proposed method
   can automatically provide feasible, constructible, and optimal modular
   design alternatives. The results of this study show that it is expected
   to significantly reduce the time and effort for designing a modular
   building and generating diverse design options that can efficiently
   fulfill the final user's requirements, functional requirements, and
   manufacturing and assembly constraints.},

Title = {Linking BIM to Power BI and HoloLens 2 to Support Facility Management: A
   Case Study Approach},

Abstract = {Facility lifecycle data captured in BIM during design and construction
   are very valuable for effective facility operations and maintenance.
   Traditionally, model authoring and analysis tools have been used to
   search and query model information. These tools are not well designed to
   search and display needed data and they require a steep learning curve.
   In this paper, the authors propose the use of Power BI dashboards to
   facilitate easy access and display of lifecycle data embedded in the
   model. The implementation and use of dashboards for facility management
   are discussed using a case study. The effectiveness and usability of the
   dashboards are validated using a focus group of six industry experts
   that were first interviewed then asked to complete a questionnaire.
   Feedback from interviews indicated that customized dashboards are
   effective tools to view, analyze and draw insights on data from various
   sources and can improve facility operations and management. Numerical
   results from the PSSUQ using fourteen questions indicated positive
   responses overall with an average score of four or five from the
   majority of respondents. Finally, the authors tested integration of the
   Power BI dashboards with the HoloLens 2 to deliver relevant up-to-date
   facility lifecycle data in near real-time to field staff.},

Title = {A multi-regional based hybrid method for assessing life cycle energy use
   of buildings: A case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {760-772},

Abstract = {Although sustainable development in the construction industry has
   attracted much attention, relevant studies on the regional scale
   analysis of industrial energy performance are still rare in China,
   especially for Guangdong province, which is currently on the frontier
   and fast track of national low-carbon development. In response, this
   study integrates a multi-regional input-output method with field based
   operational data to quantify the total embodied energy consumption and
   energy transfers from the construction industry and assess the life
   cycle energy use of residential and office buildings in Guangdong
   Province. The results show that the embodied energy consumption of the
   provincial construction industry is localization dominant and fossil
   fuel oriented, which accounts for approximately 18.6\% of the total
   regional energy consumption. The geographical connection and resource
   characteristic are the two factors that influence the interregional
   energy transmissions induced by construction activities in Guangdong
   province. The result of uncertainty analysis indicates that the mean
   value of energy intensities simulated by Monte Carlo simulation is
   highly consistent with the deterministic results. It is crucial to
   improve the accuracy of the input-output analysis by providing
   sufficient economic information. At last, a number of recommendations
   are given through the technology, product, and management aspects at the
   industrial and building levels. The local government and construction
   department can benefit from implementing such environment-friendly,
   technology innovative and multi-disciplinary solutions in the
   full-process management and improvement of energy reduction of
   buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparing the midpoint and endpoint approaches based on ReCiPe-a study
   of commercial buildings in Hong Kong},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly implemented in
   analyzing the environmental performance of buildings and construction
   projects. To assess the life cycle environmental performance,
   decision-makers may adopt the two life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
   approaches, namely the midpoint and endpoint models. Any imprudent usage
   of the two approaches may affect the assessment results and thus lead to
   misleading findings. ReCiPe, a well-known work, includes a package of
   LCIA methods to provide assessments on both midpoint and endpoint
   levels. This study compares different potential LCIA results using the
   midpoint and endpoint approaches of ReCiPe based on the assessment of a
   commercial building in Hong Kong.
   This paper examines 23 materials accounting for over 99 \% of the
   environmental impacts of all the materials consumed in commercial
   buildings in Hong Kong. The midpoint and endpoint results are compared
   at the normalization level. A commercial building in Hong Kong is
   further studied to provide insights as a real case study. The ranking of
   impact categories and the contributions from various construction
   materials are examined for the commercial building. Influence due to the
   weighting factors is discussed.
   Normalization results of individual impact categories of the midpoint
   and endpoint approaches are consistent for the selected construction
   materials. The difference in the two approaches can be detected when
   several impact categories are considered. The ranking of materials is
   slightly different under the two approaches. The ranking of impact
   categories demonstrates completely different features. In the case study
   of a commercial building in Hong Kong, the contributions from
   subprocesses are different at the midpoint and endpoint. The weighting
   factors can determine not only the contributions of the damage
   categories to the total environment, but also the value of a single
   score.
   In this research, the midpoint and endpoint approaches are compared
   using ReCiPe. Information is whittled down from the inventories to a
   single score. Midpoint results are comprehensive while endpoint results
   are concise. The endpoint approach which provides additional information
   of damage should be used as a supplementary to the midpoint model. When
   endpoint results are asked for, a LCIA method like ReCiPe that provides
   both the midpoint and endpoint analysis is recommended. This study can
   assist LCA designers to interpret the midpoint and endpoint results, in
   particular, for the assessment of commercial buildings in Hong Kong.},

Title = {An overview of data tools for representing and managing building
   information and performance data},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted for
   representing and exchanging building data across disciplines during
   building design and construction. However, BIM's use in the building
   operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost
   sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing
   technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from
   buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are
   crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is
   consumed in buildings-a critical step to improving building performance
   for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However,
   practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to
   various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of
   data, and lack of data science skills. To unlock value from building
   data, there is a strong need for a toolchain to curate and represent
   building information and performance data in common standardized
   terminologies and schemas, to enable interoperability between tools and
   applications. This study selected and reviewed 24 data tools based on
   common use cases of data across the building life cycle, from design to
   construction, commissioning, operation, and retrofits. The selected data
   tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or
   terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The
   data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data
   collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1)
   most data representation tools can represent their intended data
   typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick
   schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none
   of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data
   schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant
   data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only
   adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages
   in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools
   were developed and maintained by different parties for different
   purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to
   support broader use cases. Finally, recommendations for future research
   on building data tools are provided for the data and buildings community
   based on the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible,
   Interoperable, and Reusable.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {In order to make up for the problems of low production efficiency, high
   labor cost, serious environmental pollution, and low degree of
   informatization of traditional tunnel construction method, an
   intelligent identification building system of prefabricated tunnel
   structure is proposed. Based on BIM Technology and integrating advanced
   concepts and technologies in the construction industry and management
   field, an intelligent construction system of prefabricated tunnel
   structure based on BIM is proposed, the characteristics, functions, and
   values of each component are introduced, and the overall architecture of
   the system is established, which can provide technical support for the
   whole life cycle construction, operation, and maintenance of
   prefabricated railway tunnel. Only 68\% of architectural designers know
   BIM Technology, while only 4\% of designers really use or are using BIM
   Technology to participate in prefabricated architectural design. Through
   this research, the use frequency of BIM can be greatly increased and
   work efficiency can be improved. To meet the requirements of railway
   tunnel construction for intelligent construction in the new era, the new
   technology and new ideas also lead the further scientific and
   technological innovation in tunnel engineering to a certain extent,
   which meets the actual needs of the development of intelligent railway
   construction technology and has a practical significance of improving

Abstract = {Construction industry, as it is well known, is one of the industries
   with the highest negative impacts on the environment concerning the
   amount of emissions generation and resources consumption. A major
   percentage of these generated emissions are a result of the massive
   amounts of different materials utilized and consumed during the
   different phases of construction processes. Targeting sustainable
   performance achievement, construction industry has to improve its
   behavior towards the environment, following the footsteps of other
   industries. Advanced technological solutions such as BIM and LCA can
   drive the construction industry towards achieving sustainability. These
   tools can improve the process of materials selection, alternatives
   comparison, etc, in order to follow sustainability principles. The
   creation of a link between LCA and BIM, as it is going to be explained,
   provides an easy and direct access to the information regarding
   environmental impacts of the different elements included in the proposed
   design. Therefore, this information can be considered during
   decision-making in the early project phases.},

Abstract = {Building permitting plays a significant role in life cycles of buildings
   because without a building permit a legal construction fails. However,
   digitalization in building permit, authorities is rare in a global
   context and issuing a building permit is primarily a manual and
   time-consuming process. In current research approaches on digital
   building permits, the focus lays on the digitalization of
   building-related regulation checks. Even if the approaches cover an
   important step in the building permit process, other significant steps
   such as administrative processes are neglected. In preliminary research,
   a building permit process model for structuring action-oriented elements
   was developed and transferred and applied to a Building Information
   Modelling (BIM)-oriented and process-based web application prototype,
   which serves as a basis. An empirical study - using qualitative expert
   interviews in a building permit authority in South Tyrol (Italy) - was
   conducted to simulate a BIM-oriented building permit review as well as
   to investigate the building permit processes thoroughly. The results
   show a classification of the information needed for digital tools
   supporting the building permit process, building permit processes of the
   case study authority, and the digital tools used. In the discussion,
   knowledge gained from a comparison between other building permit
   processes is presented alongside considerations for follow-up research.},

Title = {Case Study of Remodelling the As-Built Documentation of a Railway
   Construction into the BIM and GIS Environment},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a modern approach to managing
   the process of preparation, realization and operation of building
   objects including their documentation throughout their life cycle, based
   on database agenda platform. The aim of our research is to analyze and
   innovate existing engineering procedures with the aim: 1. to remodel the
   existing CAD documentation into BIM for the purpose of public
   procurement, 2. to provide guaranteed data to the IS of the Digital Map
   of Public Administration and 3. to provide data for the design of new
   railway structures or their reconstruction. The aim of the case study
   was to evaluate the effectiveness of remodelling the existing as-built
   documentation of a railway construction into a common BIM data
   environment (CDE), in which further subsequent construction agenda
   should be managed for the remaining period of its life cycle. Using the
   documentation for construction realization of the railway station
   Sumice, this 3D documentation was remodeled into the BIM data
   environment CDE and alternatively also into the 2D GIS environment. The
   BIM data standard developed by the State Fund for Transport
   Infrastructure was analyzed during the documentation reworking. An
   important parameter of the documentation rework was the use of a
   geodetic reference system fully compatible with the cadastral system in
   the Czech Republic. It turned out that the general data standard is only
   partially applicable for railway structures containing many special
   objects and many objects requiring individual classification. The
   remodelling of existing graphical data proved faster and more efficient
   in a GIS environment (layer oriented) compared to the need for 3D
   remodelling in a BIM CDE (object oriented). Experimental results have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of remodelling underground technical
   infrastructure objects, while the visible surface situation is often
   more effectively captured by current progressive bulk data acquisition
   technologies. In a CDE environment, existing as-built documentation data
   can be efficiently stored and administered and progressively, for the
   procurement and execution of construction, purposefully remodeled only
   to the extent required in BIM or converted into an exchangeable Digital
   Technical Map (DTM) format for public administration.},

Title = {A cyber-physical system approach for building efficiency monitoring},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {68-85},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Digitalised models can play a key role in the management of building
   life-cycle. This paper focuses on the challenges connected to the
   operation phase of buildings, when the adoption of BIM can make
   information retrieval and management easier and more efficient. More
   specifically, a BIM-based cyber-physical system for the automated
   monitoring of buildings during their regular operation is proposed and
   tested by means of a customised simulator. The system automatically
   works out key performance indicators based on the overall throughput
   effectiveness (OTE) metric, assessing both the overall efficiency and
   the efficiency of every subsystem integrated in the building. Thus,
   assessments of the contribution of every sub-system to the operation of
   the building are performed in real-time. In addition, the metric
   proposed can help manage multi-objective real-time control. The system
   is self-reconfigurable thanks to the self-similarity assumption of the
   computational structure that is designed as a holarchy of holonic
   systems. The first application reported in this paper shows that when
   intelligence is embedded at both lower and higher levels, it is possible
   to generate information that is then used to update the digital model,
   developed as a BIM. As a result, the digital model becomes the mirror of
   the physical system and stores the actual performances recorded by the
   building to support facility managers in making decisions.},

Title = {An automated IFC-based workflow for building energy performance
   simulation with Modelica},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {166-181},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Steadily increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in all
   phases of building's lifecycle, together with more attention for openBIM
   and growing software support for the most recent version of the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC 4) have created a very promising context for an
   even broader application of Building Energy Performance Simulation
   (BEPS). At the same time, an urgent need for modeling guidelines and
   standardization becomes evident. A well-defined BIM-based workflow and a
   set of tools that fully exploit and extend the possibilities of the
   openBIM-technology can make the difference when it comes to reliability
   and cost of BEPS to design, build and operate high-performance
   buildings. This paper describes the essential elements of this
   integrated workflow, explains why openBIM comprises much more than just
   a standardized file-format and what is achieved with the already
   available technology, namely the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and a
   newly developed Model View Definition. This MVD is tailored to the needs
   of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) that uses the Modelica
   language together with a specific library (IDEAS) and can easily be
   adapted to other libraries. In this project, several tools have been
   developed to closely integrate BEPS and IFC4. The simulation engine now
   gets the vast majority of the required input directly from the
   IFC4-file. For the implementation of the tools, the PYTHON language and
   the open source library IfcOpenShell are used. A case study is
   presented, that was used for extensive tests of the proposed approach
   and the implemented tools. The essential benefits of this new workflow
   are illustrated, and the feasibility is demonstrated. Opportunities and
   remaining bottlenecks are identified to encourage further development of
   BIM software to fully support IFC4 as an information source for BEPS.
   Besides some improvements of the proprietary class structure and
   functionality, enabling the export of IFC4 files based on custom MVDs is
   one required key feature.},

Title = {Life cycle sustainability tracker: a dynamic approach},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 31},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper bridges the gap between the theory and practice by
   developing a life cycle sustainability tracker (LCST). The study is
   seeking to proffer solutions to an observed shortcoming of conventional
   life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) communication platforms.
   Notably, the static nature of the information provided on such platforms
   has made it difficult for them to be used for real-time decision-making
   and predictions. The main aim of this paper is to develop a LCST that
   facilitates a dynamic visualisation of life cycle sustainability results
   and allows for an integrated benchmark across the dimensions of
   sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThe study leverages the model
   development capabilities of the design science research strategy in
   accomplishing a dynamic and novel communication platform. A life cycle
   thinking methodology and appropriate multicriteria decision approach
   (MCDA) is applied to accomplish a comprehensive, streamlined and
   replicable approach in mapping and tracking the progress of sustainable
   development goals (SDGs) in the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)
   projects in India.FindingsIt was found that: (1) The use of the LCST
   tracker provides a dynamic and holistic insight into the key LCSA
   indicators with clearly defined benchmarks to assess the impact on the
   SDG 11, (2) The NIP projects achieve an upward trend across all the
   regions, and the percentage of opportunities ranges from 11 to 24\%,
   with the South experiencing the highest growth and the North having the
   minimal increase in percentage and (3) The assessment score (52-58\%)
   provides performance metrics that align well with the LCST - which
   ranges between ``Fair{''} and ``Average{''} for all the regions in
   India.Originality/valueThe novelty of this research is that the LCST
   provides a transparent and harmonised approach to reporting on the LCSA
   results. The LCST utilises heat maps and radial mapping to achieve an
   intuitive display of large amounts of highly heterogeneous data, thus
   allowing the synthesis of large sets of information compactly and with
   coherence. Progress towards the SDGs change on a yearly basis; hence, a
   dynamic LCSA tool provides a timely and the valuable context to map and
   track performance across different regions and contexts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings has become one of the most critical
   problems in all countries and principles of sustainability suggest that
   a satisfactory solution must be found to reduce energy consumption. This
   study aims to identify and prioritize energy consumption optimization
   strategies in buildings. Data collection consists of gather-ing primary
   data from the existing literature and secondary data from interviews,
   questionnaires, and simulations through building information modeling
   (BIM) tools. Twenty-nine strategies were identified and categorized into
   five groups according to their nature and ranked using one of the
   multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods called the step-wise
   weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA). A case study building in
   Shiraz, Iran, was simulated using BIM software, and the energy saving
   potential of the highest ranked strategies were obtained. According to
   the results, significant contributors to the energy consumption
   optimization were ``Using renew-able energy resources,{''} ``Using
   efficient insulation,{''} and ``Using suitable materials,{''} providing
   100\%, 35\%, and 23\% efficacy, respectively. The results obtained from
   this study can inform the building industry's key stakeholders regarding
   the best strate-gies to apply in order to reduce energy consumption and
   improve sustainability in the construction industry.},

Abstract = {There is significant scope for increasing the performance of commercial
   buildings across all dimensions of sustainability. For this to be
   realised, however requires the development of more advanced real time
   assessment systems which provide automated eco-efficiency performance
   checking direct from 3D CAD as a regular and integral part of the design
   process rather than in late or post-design where options are more
   restricted. An integrated approach to directly link choice of materials
   and their environmental impacts with 3D CAD model object-oriented files
   containing significant building information, has been developed by the
   Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation as a first step
   in this process. From 3D CAD objects, the system called LCADesign{*}
   automatically obtains the quantities of all building components
   associated with the selected products, calculates a complete inventory
   of constituents of building products, and links these to a Life Cycle
   Inventory database of building materials. The Life Cycle Inventory
   database includes all resource usage and emissions to the environment
   from the extraction of raw material resources, through their
   manufacture, transport, use, recycling, and maintenance. A number of
   performance assessment indicators can then be used to compare options in
   the choice of materials or design. An application to a commercial
   building project in Melbourne, Australia is provided to illustrate the
   potential of virtual building modelling.},

Abstract = {The main goal of green building is to provide comfortable life for its
   residents, while encountering the negative impacts on the surrounding
   environment. This goal can be achieved by applying effective
   methodologies throughout the entire life cycle of the building and
   maintaining an efficient usage of the available energy resources. As
   part of ``building information modeling (BIM),{''} there are numerous
   software simulation applications that can be used for analyzing, and
   modeling energy consumption in all stages of green building, starting
   from the initial stages of planning and design, up to the final stages
   of operation and maintenance. In this research work, we conduct a
   thorough investigation, analysis, and comparison of the performance of
   most common software applications used for simulating and modeling the
   energy consumption in green building, and subsequently, the best
   application is recognized based on unified selection criteria, which
   include various sets of design parameters and operating conditions.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) produces positive results for the
   construction delivery process. BIM obtains these types of results by
   enabling information interoperability in respect of a building or
   facility throughout its life cycle phases starting at the conceptual
   design, continuing to facility management, and, in particular, dealing
   with contractual challenges for BIM-based construction projects. In
   spite of these compelling contributions by BIM in optimizing
   construction processes, their complexity leaves them still vulnerable to
   risk and uncertainty from unforeseen circumstances. The case study
   presented in this paper has developed insights into the implications of
   enhancing information interoperability by assessing the following
   categories of BIM-based contractual issues: (1) technology
   compatibility, (2) auditing procedures, (3) responsibilities,
   information and communication technology (ICT) protocols, and processes,
   and (4) transfer procedures. Project documents were reviewed followed by
   semistructured interviews with eight relevant project stakeholders to
   enable data triangulation. The set of results obtained was based on
   adopting the hierarchical Jaccard's coefficient cluster analysis that
   then initiated a starting point from which a more comprehensive data
   interpretation was developed. Several new codes emerged from the
   session. Respondents described BIM as a new strategic management
   innovation, and they discussed the need to consider legal aspects when
   devising BIM contracts. The strategies were then consolidated into a
   model data validation conceptual framework as a means of protecting the
   data from loss, corruption, and/or manipulation.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the increasing complexity of buildings highlights the need for
   the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) sector
   to manage a large amount of data. In this scenario, the building
   digitisation process offers the opportunity to create virtual databases
   to collect data from different disciplines efficiently. At this point,
   Building Information Modelling represents the innovative methodology
   able to manage a building in its entire life cycle.
   Its application has been studied and documented in the design phase to
   construction, but it is important to underline its relevance in the
   Facility Management (FM) sector. While the literature highlights the
   many potentials, it also draws attention to the criticalities of using
   BIM for FM, such as inconsistent and organic asset data acquisition
   guidelines, inadequate knowledge integration due to different schemas,
   syntaxes and semantics, and lack of systematic cataloguing of different
   sources.
   The contribution of this study is the identification of a generic set of
   information requirements for FM systems, which should be included in BIM
   As-Built models for efficient facility operations and maintenance using
   an open standard format such as Construction-Operations Building
   Information Exchange (COBie). To this aim, the process is structured in
   three steps starting with Data Acquisition with digital survey
   techniques to obtain a 3D point cloud. Then, Data Integration in a Revit
   platform, and finally, defining what information from the BIM model
   could be useful, Data Management to transfer the identified specific
   information requirements into FM systems.},

Abstract = {Currently, new processes are being developed for the model-driven design
   of structures which make use of the upcoming means of digitalization,
   such as object-oriented-modeling (OOM), interconnecting Web-based
   Server-Architecture, Machine-Algorithms for design and fabrication
   procedures. Relevant Building Information is modeled over the lifecycle
   which means that data is available and disposable and no longer
   ``hidden{''} in documents (i.e. design is no longer document driven).
   New processes focus on the optimization of engineering tasks in the
   design of structures, such as definition of initial requirements,
   construction and simulation (optimize geometry and material
   consumption), time scheduling and cost estimation. BIM principle:
   Information should be assigned and used without any redundancies in all
   phases and processes of the product life-cycle. This contribution picks
   up the idea of comprehensive parametric product templates in combination
   with an implicit design technology as it is widely used in the
   production industry for an automated but still strongly adaptive design.
   These techniques are very helpful especially in the preliminary design
   of road bridge structures.},

Title = {Consideration of Thermal Comfort, Daylighting Comfort, and Life-Cycle
   Decarbonization in the Retrofit of Kindergarten Buildings in China: A
   Case Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Kindergartens play a crucial role in nurturing the physical, cognitive,
   and social development of children. Hence, designing kindergarten
   buildings requires the consideration of the unique requirements and
   behavior of children. Considering the rapid urbanization of China and
   its commitment to achieving the 3060 carbon goal, in this study, we
   examine the retrofitting of kindergarten buildings in China and propose
   a retrofit optimization method for kindergarten buildings that considers
   thermal comfort, daylighting, and life-cycle carbon emissions. Through
   this method, information on the thermal and daylighting comfort of
   occupants, weather data, occupant scheduling, and envelope and energy
   system of the kindergarten building to be retrofitted can be obtained
   through various approaches, such as video playback, field investigation,
   literature research, and consult drawings. On this basis, optimization
   variables are selected, and a physical model is established to guide the
   retrofit process. Afterward, a rapid comprehensive optimization
   framework based on parallel computing is adopted to obtain the
   comprehensive optimal design scheme for the building to be retrofitted.
   The proposed method is applied to a kindergarten building retrofit case
   in Nanjing, China, and the results show that the optimal comprehensive
   scheme results in a reduction in carbon emissions of 34,158.3 kg, an
   increase in the thermal comfort period of 2.7\%, and an improvement in
   daylighting comfort of 79.7\% over the benchmark scheme. The
   significance of this study extends beyond its potential for widespread
   application in kindergarten building retrofits. It contributes to
   advancing sustainable building design and environmental stewardship,
   creating healthier and more comfortable learning environments for
   children while mitigating the environmental impact of buildings.
   Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of considering children's unique
   needs and behaviors in building design, ultimately leading to better
   outcomes for their overall development.},

Title = {The many faces of heating transitions. Deeper understandings of future
   systems in Sweden and beyond},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {290},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Swedish buildings require additional heating inputs for many months each
   year, much of which comes from district heating systems fed by fuel
   combustion, electrical devices and recycled heat sources; localised
   heating is also generated within individual buildings. Optimised
   projections using the EnergyPLAN model for a so-called ``smart
   energy{''} scenario predict dramatic reductions in biomass use
   accompanied by increases in electricity, recycled heat and biogas.
   Electricity generation routes are also predicted to change, shifting
   away from nuclear and biomass sources towards wind, solar and biogas
   technologies. While such transitions are expected to lower greenhouse
   gas emissions, current assessment methods rarely examine the breadth of
   other environmental and material supply aspects at play. Here, a novel
   new approach provides deeper insights into current and future Swedish
   heating scenarios for 11 key indicators by considering heat production
   processes over their full life cycles. Results suggest that favourable
   reductions are likely in five of these indicators, but these benefits
   are offset by unfavourable outcomes in others, including all three raw
   material supply indicators. Ultimately, the study provides a novel
   example of ways in which additional tools can complement existing
   modelling techniques and expand the scope of available information used
   to assist heating transition decisions.},

Abstract = {Construction is still a sector with high incidence of accidents.
   Therefore, it's imperative to implement methodologies to improve safety
   in this sector. Building Information Modeling (BIM) emerges as a tool
   that allows the implementation of safety throughout the life cycle of a
   construction project, minimizing hazards and risks, consequently
   increasing safety. This paper aims to demonstrate BIM's methodology
   potential for the implementation of safety measures throughout planning
   and the application of this information on the worksite management. A
   case study based on BIM 4D was developed in which safety measures to
   prevent falls from height were applied. With 4D simulation, it is
   possible to follow the execution of work giving Safety Technicians the
   capability to visualize in each phase which measures should be
   implemented. In conclusion, BIM contributes to safety measures
   integration from the design phase to the construction phase, making
   safety management easier throughout all construction project phases.},

Abstract = {Theme: Despite the complementarity between the Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Asset Management methodologies, the connection
   between them is difficult because its use particular vocabularies and
   different knowledge structures.
   Objective: To propose a semantic connection between the Asset Management
   methodologies and BIM, in the airport context.
   Method: A qualitative-exploratory research was employed, supported by
   the use of a questionnaire with open and multiple-choice questions,
   directed to employees in the areas of Maintenance and Engineering in an
   airport administrator. Focus group practices were adopted to identify
   the relevant terms and format this connection.
   Results: (i) identification of strategic assets in the airport sector;
   (ii) mapping between strategic assets that may have a relevant interface
   with BIM; (iii) proposing a vocabulary to integrate the areas; (iv)
   definition of a relationship structure to connect the asset management
   requirements to BIM.
   Final remarks: As a potential gain, it is estimated the improvement of
   the management of BIM processes and Asset Management, since these
   processes often use a wide range of software and systems to control a
   building during its life cycle and the definition of an integrated
   structure allows the information inherent to the control of this cycle
   to be known and shared.},

Abstract = {BIM is representing a shift in the traditional process of building
   delivery. Its adoption in US reached 71\% in 2012 rising from 17\% in
   2007; moreover, Europe is going to adopt BIM for public contracting as
   promoted by the European Union Public Procurement Directive. Meanwhile,
   BIM is widely diffused in UK and Northern Europe, as it includes a more
   accurate documentation, less rework and shorter project timelines. The
   use of BIM to provide data for energy performance evaluation and
   sustainability assessment is defined Green BIM and pioneering design
   organizations are adopting this approach to enable integrated design,
   construction and maintenance towards Net Zero Energy buildings. Green
   BIM includes Building Energy Modelling dealing with project energy
   performance to identify options optimising building energy efficiency
   during the life cycle. By allowing revisions during the design phase,
   project teams can ensure that customers' green ambitions beyond
   regulation compliance can be realized, together with technical and
   economic requirements. Thus, BIM can provide information to support the
   calculation of a number of credit points to define goal levels of
   sustainability related to rating systems. The aim of the paper is to
   investigate the opportunity to include the ``green dimension{''} in BIM
   considering the more diffused rating systems. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {The phase of operation and maintenance (O\&M) is the most time-consuming
   and cost-intensive stage in the project life cycle. However, the
   potential benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in this phase
   have not been fully explored, unlike in the design and construction
   phases. This is particularly evident in the absence of a comprehensive
   assessment of its application capabilities. In light of this setting, we
   develop a BIM maturity assessment model (BIM MAM) for the project's O\&M
   phase. The proposed model comprises of an assessment indicator system
   that facilitates experts in providing individual assessment results, and
   a collective opinion aggregation method in a probabilistic context based
   on a multi-objective optimization model that is employed to generate the
   ultimate collective assessment results. The established multi-objective
   optimization model for BIM MAM incorporates the influence of human
   behavior factors on the final results by introducing the fairness
   concern utility level as an objective. Finally, we take Wuhan Jiangxia
   Sewage Treatment Plant as a practical case to illustrate the
   effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed BIM MAM.},

Title = {An integrated decision support framework for selecting envelope and AC
   systems in hot-humid climate},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper aims to introduce a framework that applies life cycle cost
   (LCC)-based optimization, life cycle assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) methods for the selection of optimum envelope
   materials and AC systems for housing projects. A total of 37 selection
   criteria and 28 material alternatives were first identified through a
   comprehensive literature review and interviews with local experts.
   ``DesignBuilder{''}, a computer simulation software, was used to conduct
   the LCC-based optimization and LCA for the identified alternatives.
   Furthermore, uncertainties and risk associated with the selected
   alternatives were computed using Monte Carlo simulation via the Crystal
   Ball software and Efficient Frontier analysis via the Excel
   Spreadsheets. The identified selection criteria were then prioritized
   and assigned with utility scores based on the analytical hierarchy
   process (AHP) and multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) methods. Seven
   scenarios with different objectives were set for an existing case study.
   The implementation of the framework showed that when taken into account
   the application of multi-criteria methods, the highest saving
   combination of materials is selected by the framework. The validation
   process was carried out through conducting interviews with local experts
   based on the results obtained from real case project. The experts agreed
   that the proposed framework can be beneficial to the industry as it
   takes into consideration not only quantitative criteria, but also
   qualitative criteria that are important to owners and designers.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a software tool for the predictive life-cycle
   management of reinforced concrete bridges. The novel aspect of this
   particular tool is the integration of non-destructive inspection
   techniques in combination with fully-probabilistic deterioration models.
   The use of these models requires that the building under examination be
   subdivided into multiple levels of detail. We employ a 3D model of the
   building for creating and visualizing the different system levels. At
   the same time the 3D model forms the basis of any data acquisition,
   analysis and evaluation. The system is implemented by coupling a Java 3D
   front-end with a relational database, in which the construction geometry
   and all related information is stored. Due to the long life span of
   bridge structures, the software is required to satisfy special
   requirements in terms of its flexibility. It is shown how new materials,
   inspection techniques, deterioration models, repair procedures etc. can
   easily be integrated into the software tool.},

Year = {2013},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The current application of building information modeling (BIM) in the
   construction industry is generally focused on using the complete
   building information model during the life cycle of the project. With
   more information being added to the model, the size of the model file
   and the difficulty to manipulate the model increase. However, different
   use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information
   stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology
   applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology
   in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this
   study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building
   information model from the original complete model. The building
   information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An
   ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema
   specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is
   generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances
   in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction
   algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed
   to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and
   an IFC model from a real building. The results indicated that the use of
   ontology provides a valid way to deal with the technical complexity of
   IFC models. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming a standard tool for
   information management throughout the life cycle of a construction
   project. Elements in BIM are designed in a Cartesian coordinate system
   (Engineering system) with no direct relation to the project's geographic
   location. Accurate georeferencing of BIM data is required both for
   construction and integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
   as improperly treated or neglected scale distortions can lead to costly
   delays in construction as problems requiring ad hoc solutions may arise
   on site Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is an open BIM standard
   developed by buildingSMART, and the current version IFC 4 has recently
   been extended with IFC Alignment, which includes support for alignment
   geometries used for infrastructure design. This paper investigates the
   geographic capabilities of IFC 4 and its extension IFC Alignment. The
   study identifies a lack of support for non-uniform scale factors and
   object-specific map projections as the largest weaknesses.},

Title = {Augmenting materials passports to support disassembly planning based on
   building information modelling standards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {90},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Selective disassembly planning and materials passports are precursor
   technologies to support the retrieval of reusable building components
   efficiently. Selective disassembly relies on information about the
   recovery capacity of the components, while materials passports can be
   used to keep track of the disassembly information along the component's
   life cycles. However, the required information for selective disassembly
   is not represented in materials passports. Therefore, we developed a
   research approach to augment materials passports by integrating the
   information related to the components recovery capacity using a
   BIM-based Semantic Enrichment Engine for Disassembly Planning (SEEDP).
   First, we investigated the required information for selective
   disassembly and we proposed a characterization schema for disassembly
   models. Then, we developed the semantic enriching engine, SEEDP, as a
   comprehensive solution to automate three crucial steps: data
   pre-processing, production of materials passports for components, and
   assessment of disassembly models. Finally, we implemented the approach
   for two case studies as a functional demonstration.},

Abstract = {To address the issue of inconsistencies between the 3D structural models
   built on Building Information Modeling (BIM) platforms and the original

   this paper proposes an integrated design approach for prefabricated
   steel frame structures based on BIM technology with a primary focus on
   structural safety. The application of the integrated design methodology
   for prefabricated steel frame structures, leveraging BIM technology, is
   concretely demonstrated through case studies. These illustrations focus
   on pivotal aspects: assessing the overall safety performance of the
   structure, conducting meticulous analyses of beam-to-column connection
   nodes, and harnessing the outcomes of these evaluations to inform and
   direct the optimization of the structural design. The research findings
   presented herein offer insights and methodologies for applying BIM in
   safety assessments of prefabricated steel frame structures, thereby
   further refining the comprehensive framework of BIM engagement
   throughout the entire life cycle of prefabricated steel frame

Title = {Enhancing Building Energy Efficiency through Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Building Energy Modeling (BEM) Integration: A
   Systematic Review},

Abstract = {With the ever-increasing population and historic highest energy demand,
   the energy efficiency of buildings is becoming crucial. Architectural
   firms are moving from traditional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to BIM.
   However, nearly 40\% of the energy consumption is due to buildings.
   Therefore, there is a need to integrate BIM with Building Energy
   Modeling (BEM), which presents an innovative opportunity to demonstrate
   the potential of BIM to minimize energy consumption by integrating
   building information software with data from existing energy-efficient
   building automation systems (EBAS). BEM is a form of computational
   analysis that can be used in conjunction with BIM or Computer-Aided
   Engineering (CAE) systems. In this paper, an attempt has been made to
   explore the existing literature on BIM and BEM and identify the effect
   of the integration of BEM in BIM in the design phase of the project. A
   recent survey from the last ten years (2012 to 2023) was carried out on
   Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases.
   Inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, and papers were scrutinized.
   From the results, it can be observed that the convergence of BIM and BEM
   is found to be useful in practical applications; however, projects with
   short life cycles might not be suitable for this solution. Challenges
   exist in the interoperability tools which have restrictions on data
   exchange. Binary translation is found to be the most suitable candidate
   for data exchange. The analysis further showed that the most used
   program for integrating BIM/BEM is Green Building Studio developed by
   Autodesk to improve construction and operational efficiencies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {16-52},
Abstract = {As we advance towards high-performance buildings, it is becoming
   necessary to reinforce and extend the role of building information
   modelling (BIM) to better support performance-based design. To achieve
   an optimally functioning building that fulfils the need of the end-user
   and is designed in an environmentally conscious manner necessitates
   considering energy performance, environmental performance, indoor air
   quality, lighting, and acoustics. To consider these multiple criteria,
   use of computer-based modelling tools and comprehensive simulation
   methods becomes essential. These criteria are typically assessed after
   the main phases of architectural design of the building, and the
   knowledge is passed on to the engineers for development of the technical
   design. During the technical design process, the exchange of data
   between the design model and a selected building performance aspect may
   occur. This paper investigates the potential of BIM-based models at the
   core of providing input data required for performance-based simulations
   (BPS) to enable iterative multi-criteria assessment towards high
   performance buildings. A comprehensive literature review of 249
   documents was conducted to identify the current state of knowledge and
   provide future directions for design and simulation tools to better
   quantify and evaluate the performance aspects. Furthermore, it explains
   and clarifies stakeholders' current ability, needs, barriers, and
   potentials in using BIM for assessing building performance through
   nineteen expert interviews of key BIM stakeholders in Finland.},

Abstract = {Management and maintenance of existing buildings remains a major problem
   due to the lack of existing three-dimensional (3D) models and accurate
   as-built representation. In this paper the authors propose to use 3D
   scanner technology to capture the as-built and existing conditions of
   the buildings combined with building information modeling (BIM) as the
   underlying technology, which is a 3D semantic representation of all the
   life cycle phases of a building. This paper presents the results from
   creating as-built BIM models of existing buildings, using point cloud (a
   set of points in 3D space) and machine learning as an intermediate
   medium. Machine learning methodologies are used to speed up the
   computation of segmentation and classification of point clouds from a 3D
   virtual indoor environment using procedural modeling, which focused on
   two attributes, point density and the level of random errors. In this
   paper we will present findings on the evaluation of the performance of
   machine learning segmentation and classification algorithm based on the
   comparison of ten different point cloud data sets. Different sets of
   segmentation and classification models with comparison between models
   and within themselves were provided, which included the mean loss and
   accuracy between models with different point density.},

Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {11-18},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) in building construction remains a
   worldwide problem in terms of workplace injury, illness and fatality
   statistics. Construction Safety requires care and planning throughout
   the project life-cycle, from the design phase to maintenance. Initial
   attempts to improve OHS consider the safety aspects in the design phase
   and the development of manual safety processes in the execution phase.
   The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently
   experiencing rapid growth in construction operations, planning and
   management, as well as in Safety Management. Thanks to the use of this
   new tool, we can expect to see a change in the way that safety is
   addressed, as seen in the literature review, based on the large number
   of contributions in recent years.
   This study reviews the existing literature surrounding BIM and
   Construction Safety in order to explore both useful findings and the
   gaps in knowledge for future research. The main result shows that the
   growing implementation of BIM in the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industry is changing the way safety can be
   approached. Potential safety hazards can be automatically identified and
   corresponding prevention methods can be applied using an automated
   approach.},

Abstract = {With increasing use of BIM (Building Information Modelling) in the
   design of construction projects, opportunities arise to integrate Life
   Cycle Analysis (LCA) in early design phases efficiently with minimum
   additional burden for the design team. Different levels of integration
   can be envisaged, ranging from a BOQ export (Bill Of Quantity) based on
   the BIMmodel to import in native LCA-software, up to a real time
   LCA-calculation within the native design environment, giving real time
   feedback on design decisions, or alternatively utilizing the
   standardized BIM-information exchange format IFC. Based on the
   evaluation of existing tools, this paper focuses on the possible
   workflows for the integration of LCA and BIM. A comparative analysis
   between these different information flow structures exposes their
   advantages and disadvantages, depending on the design phase they are
   used in and the availability of generic, product-specific or
   manufacturer-specific LCA-data.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Due to the increasing recognition of global climate change, the building
   and construction industries are under pressure to reduce carbon
   emissions. A central issue in striving towards reduced carbon emissions
   is the need for a practicable and meaningful yardstick for assessing and
   communicating greenhouse gas (GHG) results. ISO 14067 was published by
   the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in May 2013. By
   providing specific requirements in the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   approach, the standard clarifies the GHG assessment in the aspects of
   choosing system boundaries and simulating use and end-of-life phases
   when quantifying carbon footprint of products (CFPs). More importantly,
   the standard, for the first time, provides a step-to-step guide and
   standardized template for communicating CFPs in the form of CFP external
   communication report, CFP performance tracking report, CFP declaration
   and CFP label. ISO 14067 therefore makes a valuable contribution to GHG
   quantification and transparent communication and comparison of CFPs. In
   addition, as cradle-to-grave should be used as the system boundary and
   end-of-life phases can be simulated, ISO 14067 will hopefully promote
   the development and implementation of simulation technologies, with
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) in particular, in the building and
   construction industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   industry. Product libraries entail some essential information contents,
   which have been recognized as: identification, classification,
   composition and performance. Product data significance is found from its
   availability through the life cycle of the building. The life cycle
   availability point of view is emphasized in product library applications
   and software interoperability. Software has to be able to identify the
   terms of product comparability within searches and data exchange, and
   instance them into software objects. To enable the software vendors and
   product manufacturers to output interoperable data, BIM based procedures
   require commonly agreed information exchange methods.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Digital media is reshaping architectural design by introducing
   new tools, methods and workflows. Among various AEC tools, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) has gained popularity due to its
   collaboration platform enabling cross-disciplinary teamwork during whole
   life cycle of buildings. BIM has further transformed culture and
   processes associated with design, construction and operation of
   buildings, hence triggering new building regulations in developed
   countries. However, in developing countries, BIM implementation is
   facing several barriers, such as lack of investment in technology and
   training, hesitation in quitting traditional tools and practices, etc.
   The purpose of this paper is to highlight potentials of BIM for
   developing countries, which are in need of more sustainable policies for
   enhancing their economic and environmental performances.
   Design/methodology/approach - Throughout the text, a literature review
   on BIM including its dimensions and benefits, impacts on architectural
   design and adoption in global and local contexts is provided. In case
   study, surveys and structured interviews are conducted with BIM user and
   non-BIM user architects throughout Pakistan. Beyond 2D/3D modeling, the
   use of BIM applications for sustainable design process such as
   scheduling (4D), cost estimation (5D), performance analysis and
   facilities management (6D) is investigated.
   Findings - Using analytical tools of an online surveying tool and SPSS
   statistical software, barriers and motivations for BIM implementation in
   Pakistan are determined. Strategies for further BIM adoption and
   implementation via ``education and training institutions{''} and
   ``supporting organizations and institutions{''} are defined.
   Originality/value - As a developing country, Pakistan shall be moving
   the barriers for the spread of BIM technology. Recent research covered
   the entire AEC sector (Masood et al., 2014; Sohu et al., 2017; Ali et
   al., 2018), yet this paper focuses specifically on architectural design
   and practice field. In order to find out experiences and expectations
   about BIM technology in the architecture sector, professionals are
   surveyed and four chief architects are interviewed. How far have
   Pakistani architects adopted BIM? For which project types and scales is
   BIM more serviceable for them? Which BIM applications are they
   implementing to overcome the limitations in their professional practice?
   In Pakistan, where sustainability, in terms of scheduling, cost
   estimation, performance analysis and facilities management, is an
   indispensible measure for local practices, has implementation of BIM
   technology achieved sustainability in architectural design process? What
   are the motivations of Pakistani architects for becoming BIM users in
   future?},

Abstract = {This paper explores how collaboration inside the Building Information

   engineering students. The National BIM Standard Project Committee
   defines BIM as ``a digital representation of physical and functional
   characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource far
   information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions
   during its life-cycle{''}. A qualitative study in the participant
   observation tradition was conducted and unobtrusive artifacts such as
   drawings, informal interviews, surveys, participant journaling and
   dialogues, and raw field notes were evaluated to probe inside this
   shared knowledge resource. The setting is a series of introductory
   architectural design studios at the University of Wyoming, USA. The
   results illustrate that inside the BIM repository a real-time
   simultaneous collaboration emerges as a new learning environment. The
   students experience a sophisticated concept development (SCD) that
   extends beyond the previously documented rapid concept development. The
   SCD encourages the students to pursue more complex design alternatives.
   The advantages and disadvantages of real-time Simultaneous collaboration
   establish the need for `best practice' hallmarks in the area of
   disciplinary team learning.},

Abstract = {A great amount of information needs to be managed along the building
   life cycle in order to fulfil building codes, standards and regulations,
   client and user requirements. However, a lack of transparency in the
   information management and a lack of communication between stakeholders
   often bring to the adoption of solutions in the design process that do
   not meet the original requirements. Therefore, an ordered structure for
   information improves its storage, enhancing its visibility,
   traceability, usability and re-usability. In addition, for public works
   contracts and design contests, the use of specific electronic tools,
   such as building information electronic modelling tools, is often
   required for the information management. The paper presents the efforts
   devoted within the Italian building sector for proposing a standardized
   structure and developing tools for collecting, sharing and exchanging
   information between stakeholders involved in different stages of the
   building process. An enhanced use of information relying on the adoption
   of the standardized structure of information is presented, proposing
   dedicated applications for automating the process of information

   Seismic Retrofit in Peruvian Primary Schools},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technology that
   improves visualization, understanding, and transparency in construction
   projects. Its use in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA\&C), while
   still scarce, is developing in combination with multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) methods, such as the choosing by advantages (CBA)
   method. Despite the holistic nature of MCDM methods, the inclusion of
   life cycle environmental metrics is lagging in construction projects in
   LA\&C. However, recent studies point toward the need to optimize the
   synergies between BIM and life cycle assessment (LCA), in which a method
   like CBA could allow improving the quality of the decisions. Therefore,
   the main objective of this study is to integrate LCA and CBA methods to
   identify the effect that the inclusion of environmental impacts can have
   on decision-making in public procurement, as well as comparing how this
   final decision differs from an exclusively LCA-oriented interpretation
   of the results. Once the LCA was performed, a set of additional criteria
   for the CBA method were fixed, including transparency, technical, and
   social indicators. Thereafter, a stakeholder participative workshop was
   held in order to gather experts to elucidate on the final decision. The
   methodology was applied to a relevant construction sector problem
   modelled with BIM in the city of Lima (Peru), which consisted of three
   different construction techniques needed to retrofit educational
   institutions. Results from the LCA-oriented assessment, which was
   supported by Monte Carlo simulation, revealed a situation in which the
   masonry-based technique showed significantly lower environmental impacts
   than the remaining two options. However, when a wider range of
   technical, social, and transparency criteria are added to the
   environmental indicators, this low-carbon technique only prevailed in
   those workshop tables in which environmental experts were present and
   under specific computational assumptions, whereas teams with a higher
   proportion of government members were inclined to foster alternatives
   that imply less bureaucratic barriers. Finally, the results constitute
   an important milestone when it comes to including environmental factors
   in public procurement in LA\&C.},

Abstract = {The construction industry, as one of the three major carbon emission
   (CE) industries, accounts for about 39\% of the global CE. Thus,
   approaches for energy saving and emission reduction (ES/ER) cannot be
   delayed. With the advent of the Industry 4.0 era, information technology
   (IT) is used to investigate CE in the construction industry, which
   provides great convenience for measuring and calculating building carbon
   emissions (BCE) and proposing effective ES/ER measures. However, limited
   studies have provided a holistic overview of the application of IT in
   BCE. To fill this gap, this study searched related articles and screened
   170 relevant papers. Based on the characteristics of the literature,
   building carbon flow (BCF) was defined. Based on scientometric analysis
   and network mapping analysis, combined with quantitative and qualitative
   analysis methods, the functions, advantages, and limitations of IT in
   each stage of BCF research were reviewed. Finally, the research trends
   and future research directions of IT in the BCF were discussed.
   Specifically, the building information model technology penetrates the
   whole process of BCF research, deep learning and artificial intelligence
   have great potential in BCF research, and multi-information technology
   integration will become the focus of subsequent research in the
   construction industry.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be defined synthetically as a
   digital model of a real estate that collects data from the different
   disciplines that contribute to its realization. In civil engineering, it
   represents an innovative approach to the construction and management of
   a building. Cost assessment is a fundamental activity both in the
   construction phase but especially in the economic management of real
   estate assets. The use of the BIM makes possible to carry out a rapid
   and precise estimate of the costs of production, reconstruction or
   maintenance during the entire life cycle of the building. This work aims
   to implement the depreciation of real estate assets within a BIM model
   in order to develop an easy tool to support the economic decisions of
   those involved in real estate asset management. In particular, the
   possibility of observing in real time the dynamics of depreciation of
   the building, placing it in relation, on the one hand, with the dynamics
   of the land rent and, on the other, with the costs of restoration, can
   become essential in the choices about times and ways of maintenance,
   building renovation or eventual razing. The first simulations well
   confirm the reasons for the research, which is placed in the same
   direction identified by relevant legislation aimed at the definition of
   the Real Estate Due Diligence and the digital dossier of the building.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper reviews Building Energy Modeling (BEM) development using
   classification and review of articles for the recent years (2015-2018)
   to explore how much BEM methodologies have been used Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) database during this period. Nowadays, BEM
   and supervision are the most important challenges of smart cities, and
   BIM has a good and useful source of information for buildings. Recent
   innovations have provided the opportunity for construction industry to
   invest in state-of-the-art technologies and adopt new processes. Among
   these new methodologies is BIM, which has developed for the construction
   industry over the last two decades. Integrating graphical and
   non-graphical information, it enables construction industry stakeholders
   to work collaboratively for efficient project delivery throughout the
   life cycle of construction projects. The use of BEM in construction
   industry has come about to respond to the global call for energy
   conservation and sustainability. BEM tools and processes can be used to
   simulate energy performance, evaluate energy needs and optimize

Abstract = {Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry possesses a
   diverse workforce involving multi-stakeholder participation. Building
   information modelling (BIM) technology appears as a cutting-edge
   platform for collaboration throughout the construction life-cycle.
   However, many barriers, such as high cost of implementation, inefficient
   data interoperability, and lack of skilled personnel have diminished the
   adoption of BIM technology to be slower than anticipated. One of the
   hidden and overlooked problems is that the current BIM technology is
   only able to offer its functionality in a strictly uniform manner
   regardless of workforce's knowledge levels, information needs, and the
   level of development (LOD) requirements. To address this gap, we are
   proposing a new intelligent BIM companion (iBCom) technology that can
   assist diverse workforce to actively seek and efficiently access and use
   BIM information through interactive and context-sensitive natural
   language conversations. The ability to efficiently and accurately
   retrieve information from BIM models based on user's information needs
   is critical to support the iBCom technology. This paper thus proposes a
   novel network-based BIM information extraction approach that
   automatically extracts building element information from the industry
   foundation classes (IFC) files. The proposed methodology is based on
   graph theory which first creates building element networks among
   principle (parent), associated (children), and terminal nodes of IFC
   data instances, and extracts the information of a particular building
   element directly from the terminal nodes of its network. The proposed
   methodology achieved 100\% precision and recall when extracting geometry
   information from two test case models.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to explore the application of BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) {[}1] in Urban Planning. Using BIM
   technology, urban planning and design from the three-dimensional
   information model to start, making the original two-dimensional drawings
   of the abstract has become ``concrete{''} and ``visualization{''}. In
   order to achieve the design goals and three-dimensional visualization,
   such as VR (virtual reality), designers use the three-dimensional
   planning diagram to communicate the design, discussion and optimization
   with the customer to be identified ultimately. By using the BIM
   simulation of the 3D terrain combined with the design to see whether the
   layout of the building is reasonable, designers guarantee that road and
   landscape design is up to design expectations. Through building
   information model, it is reasonable to analyze the sunshine, noise,
   ventilation and so on so forth. BIM delivers benefits the building
   project life-cycle in every aspect. For instance, it helps making better
   design decision, building more efficiently, and managing and maintaining
   building portfolios more effectively. BIM supports architects throughout
   the green design. It uses the concept to ameliorate reality with
   improved quality and efficiency. It ameliorates your creative vision
   with innovative technology solutions which enable you to impact the
   green design. This research case aims at identifying the shortcomings of
   the design through sunshine analysis and ventilation analysis, thus
   optimizing the design. This not only makes the planning and design more
   reasonable, but also can meet the corresponding green building standards
   at the beginning of the design.},

Abstract = {The construction industry consumes an enormous amount of global
   resources and produces more waste than any other sector. The need to
   move toward sustainable development in construction requires significant
   changes in construction and demolition (C\&D) waste management. The
   estimation of waste, recycling materials and reusable components could
   be vital in waste management, achieving huge efficiency in the
   construction industry. Moreover, a typical building comprises of an
   extensive amount of materials and components with various
   characteristics. This study proposes a Building Information Modelling
   (BIM)-based system to allow the circular economy by storing information
   of the materials and components of buildings and by effectively managing
   the recycling of materials and reuse of components. A tool which serves
   as a Material and Component (M\&C) bank was developed with PHP and MYSQL
   by making use of a web browser able to extract the materials and
   component information of a building through the BIM model. This
   information is vital for several uses such as quantification of C\&D
   waste and assessing for the design for deconstruction. It can also be
   used to obtain the information of the reusable condition of the
   components and instructions for the reconstruction.},

Abstract = {Requirements are recognized as the NUMBER ONE cause of failed projects!
   Over budget, over schedule, reduced scope, poor quality, unhappy
   customers and cancelled projects are the results of bad requirements.
   The solution to bad requirements is to introduce a ``Business or Mission
   analysis{''} as it initiates the life cycle of the system of interest by
   defining the problem domain that are bound to the solution domain while
   developing the business requirements and validation criteria. The market
   requirements for intelligent devices (district energy management,
   performance analysis and simulations) for SMART Cities has pushed the
   construction industry into experiencing product and service developments
   requiring concepts similar to the system life cycle processes per
   ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in
   the industry has closed the gap analysis between designed applications
   used in architectural design and those used in fabrication. This papers
   disruption innovation theory requires the need to change traditional
   construction management techniques into System Processes. The designated
   BIM manager cannot use a virtual model to develop infrastructure based
   on 2D managing concepts. This paper will demonstrate how system science
   and system thinking methodology can be used to enhance the management
   principles of construction projects using virtual designs. The authors
   apply a problem analysis technique to a desktop case-study `construction
   project based in UAE.' The results of the analysis provide additional
   subjective thoughts targeting the problem space associated with the
   initial solution space domain.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling is receiving increasing attention as an
   emerging technology for enhancing the life-cycle performance of
   facilities. The cooperation between all professionals involved in the
   construction chain allows to reproduce digital twins of the structures
   including information related to different disciplines, such as
   structural and architectural aspects. In this context, the use of
   Building Information Modelling, combined with an automatic tool to
   predict risk indices, could be particularly useful when dealing with
   existing bridges due to the significant structural deficiencies recently
   demonstrated by numerous bridge collapses worldwide. This paper explores
   the development of a BIM-based procedure to bring greater value in the
   design, construction, maintenance, and inspection stages. The procedure
   is applied to existing bridges and it allows to estimate a structural
   risk prioritization class of bridges according to maintained activities,
   periodical inspections, structural detailing and modelling
   uncertainties. The automatic BIM-based tool uses a workflow developed in
   Dynamo, and is able to automatically update the structural risk class
   and to provide warning if the structural safety index exceed defined
   thresholds.},

   practicability of the current BIM practices. First, this study reviewed
   84 selected BIM projects from 21 countries based on their features,
   including project information, delivery methods, BIM approaches, level
   of development, software, and emerging technologies. Second, the
   challenges and limitations of adopting BIM in the construction project
   were evaluated. One significant outcome of the research was the
   identification of key attributes that facilitate the effective use of
   BIM on construction projects. The result of this study can assist

Abstract = {Most existing studies on demolition waste (DW) quantification do not
   have an official standard to estimate the amount and type of DW.
   Therefore, there are limitations in the existing literature for
   estimating DW with a consistent classification system. Building
   information modeling (BIM) is a technology that can generate and manage
   all the information required during the life cycle of a building, from
   design to demolition. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of research
   regarding its application to the demolition stage of a building. For an
   effective waste management plan, the estimation of the type and volume
   of DW should begin from the building design stage. However, the lack of
   tools hinders an early estimation. This study proposes a BIM-based
   framework that estimates DW in the early design stages, to achieve an
   effective and streamlined planning, processing, and management.
   Specifically, the input of construction materials in the Korean
   construction classification system and those in the BIM library were
   matched. Based on this matching integration, the estimates of DW by type
   were calculated by applying the weight/unit volume factors and the rates
   of DW volume change. To verify the framework, its operation was
   demonstrated by means of an actual BIM modeling and by comparing its
   results with those available in the literature. This study is expected
   to contribute not only to the estimation of DW at the building level,
   but also to the automated estimation of DW at the district level.},

Abstract = {In current complex building designs, sustainability assessments are
   often performed after project completion, with limited impact on
   building performance which results in missed goals in terms of quality,
   cost, and time. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical
   reference-based know-why model to answer the research question ``what is
   a suitable decision support model to successfully integrate the
   sustainability requirements in the early design phase of buildings? ``.
   The model presents a process that incorporates a life-cycle perspective
   and calculates design alternatives based on a defined reference and the
   DGNB building certification system. The results show that criteria
   synergies and trade-offs can be identified, leading to improved design
   by engineers and better building performance. Our findings pave the way
   for full integration of the model into building information modeling,
   combined with artificial intelligence. This can help manage the
   complexity of the sustainable design process on the path to
   carbon-neutral buildings.},

Abstract = {In recent years, prefabricated buildings have developed rapidly because
   of their high efficiency and time saving, but the large consumption of
   resources has also led to many environmental problems. In order to
   explore the impact of prefabricated buildings on the environment, the
   environmental impact assessment of the prefabricated buildings based on
   Life Cycle Assessment Theory (LCA) and Willingness to Pay Theory (WTP)
   was carried out. First of all, this article combines field research and
   literature research, using BIM modeling methods to obtain the
   engineering quantity of prefabricated and cast-in-place buildings.
   Secondly, analyzing the whole process of the two construction modes
   based on the life cycle theory, calculate and obtain the consumption
   list. Next, the ReCiPe method is used to evaluate the environmental
   impact of prefabricated buildings, and five types of midpoint
   environmental impact assessment results are obtained: greenhouse gas
   emissions, fine particulate matter generation, acid gas emissions,
   energy and mineral resource consumption, etc. Finally, based on the
   theory of WTP, all kinds of environmental effects are unified for
   comparative analysis. The results show that the environmental load of
   the prefabricated construction method is greater than that of the
   cast-in-place method. It is necessary to further improve the
   standardization in the production technology and management methods to
   obtain more advantageous environmental performance.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Abstract = {Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) upgrades the digitization of
   buildings from 2D to 3D and has become a common paradigm in
   architecture, engineering, construction, operations, and facility
   management (AECO/FM) industry. However, embedding BIM in decision
   support systems is still a challenge because the BIM standard (Industry
   Foundation Classes, or IFC) is complex, and the geometries in BIM cannot
   be directly rendered in decision support systems, e.g., web and
   mobile-phone applications. Current efforts mainly focus on rendering BIM
   triangulation data, and limited studies investigate solutions solving
   quite long running time and enormously large memory usage in BIM
   triangulation process, especially in big BIM files. This study addresses
   this issue by introducing a parallel computing framework and providing
   an online geometry triangulation service. First, the reference
   relationships among the BIM objects were modeled as a graph according to
   the IFC specification. Second, the original large IFC file was split
   into several small independent IFC files in which all geometric objects
   that share the same shape representation were aggregated. Finally, the
   small separate IFC files were assigned to and triangulated in different
   computers in a-parallel computing cluster. Experiments showed that the
   proposed online service could greatly reduce memory usage and time
   consumption when triangulating the geometry of BIM objects.
   Processability has become a critical issue for BIM in the era of
   construction Big Data. The proposed scheme can triangulate big BIM files
   efficiently using limited memory and thus can dramatically improve the
   processability of BIM Big Data.},

Abstract = {The building information modeling (BIM) technology is a methodology that
   allows the exchange of information efficiently; it is used by
   stakeholders who participate in the building life cycle. This
   methodology is successfully utilized for new buildings; however its
   implementation in heritage architecture is still emerging. The purposes
   of this research are to perform an analysis on the BIM state of the art
   for existing buildings, to identify the knowledge gap in historic
   buildings, and to propose a theoretical method for heritage architecture
   management. To achieve these objectives, a total of 65 articles and
   papers have been analyzed. These documents were grouped into five
   categories, and conclusions were drawn. Furthermore, a theoretical
   method was proposed by reviewing the BIM literature and by inventorying
   the monument's needs. The results illustrate the emerging state of BIM
   for heritage architecture, also called historic building information
   modeling (HBIM); there are few practical applications so far, including
   database management of the historic monuments. The analysis aimed to
   propose a method to manage architectural patrimony. In conclusion, the
   creation of this HBIM method for movable and immovable heritage
   analysis, research, documentation, and management represents progress in
   how the exchange of information occurs between the different
   professionals and stakeholders involved in architectural patrimony. This
   research is part of the scientific project entitled: The Design of a
   Database, Management Model for the Information and Knowledge of
   Architectural Heritage; HAR2013-41614-R, subsidized by the Spanish

Abstract = {BIM has been widely adopted by the construction sector, though Facility
   Management ( FM) is still based on a variety of disparate FM systems.
   The operational phase requires comprehensive set of well-structured
   information regarding the building asset. Therefore, a BIM model filled
   with the multifarious information from the pre-use phase ought to be
   exploited through its integration with existing FM systems. This paper
   aims to appreciate the contribution of BIM in optimizing the processes
   conducted conventionally within the FM practice. The importance of
   sustained information flow for the efficient operational stage is a
   prerequisite of the further discussion. The exploration of FM
   application areas for BIM-enabled processes is aimed to depict the
   potential of the BIM for FM concept. By elaborating on the existing
   challenges concerning the shift from traditional FM processes to new
   BIM-based approach the outstanding problems are realized. On these
   grounds advice is provided. The study focuses mainly on new investments,
   where information management must be sustained from the project
   inception until the current operational stage. The paper proves the
   potential of BIM for the optimization of FM practices, presenting a wide
   range of application areas followed by tangible benefits for the
   building performance across its life-cycle. Identified barriers are
   assumed to be mitigated by diligent implementation of provided
   recommendations. It is concluded that BIM-based FM processes have the
   potential to shed a new light not only on the FM sector itself but on
   the perception of the whole industry being based on the collaborative
   approach towards delivery of the intelligent facilities. Nevertheless,
   such results demand profound cultural changes within the construction
   sector, with the FM appreciation as a starting point. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) software is increasingly being used
   in as a visual road design tool and offers real-time information on
   material demands as designs change. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a
   tool that is used to measure the lifetime environmental impacts of
   systems, materials and processes. LCA data sets are organized according
   to process or product, which is ideal for implementation as a parameter
   in BIM. This paper seeks to explore how BIM and LCA can be used together
   in road design by analysing existing literature, creating a Norwegian
   test case on a road designed in a BIM model and adding LCA data to the
   model before comparing to a standard LCA study of the same road.
   Challenges such as including machinery emissions, uncertainty, data
   availability, and other insights gained will be discussed. The goal of
   this paper is to present a path forward for road builders to combine LCA
   and BIM to promote simplified LCA calculations.},

Title = {A thematic review on Prevention through design (PtD) concept application
   in the construction industry of developing countries},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The life cycle of the building or any other type of structure comprises
   the stages of planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance
   until demolition. The life span of each stage is different and the
   operation and maintenance stages account for the longest period in a
   building's lifespan. On that account, building performance after its
   completion is foremost to corroborate the Prevention through Design
   (PtD) concept. PtD, also known as safety by design or design for safety,
   is the concept of reducing the potential occupational hazards beforehand
   during the design stage. The developing countries have also started
   practicing this concept. A systematic review has been used as a
   methodology to overview the applications of this concept in the
   construction industry in developing countries. The study identified 218
   peer-reviewed articles from a keyword search in online databases. The
   search process for the articles was filtered by inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. In the result, a total of 16 articles were identified. The
   ATLAST.ti 8 was utilised to conduct the theme analysis review of the
   final articles. A conceptual framework of cluster patterns on the PtD
   applications for construction industry in the developing countries has
   been developed. The framework is themed into 5 main pattern clusters:
   (1) Building life cycle, (2) Legislation, (3) Design, (4) Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), and (5) Project management (PM); from 10
   clusters: (1) Law and regulations, (2) Guidelines, (3) BIM, (4)
   Architectural design, (5) Planning stage, (6) Construction stage, (7)
   Operation and maintenance stage, (8) PM, (9) Designer's knowledge and
   (10) Designer's attitude. Hence, this paper incorporates the very latest
   information on PtD concept application in the con-struction industry of
   developing countries. The main finding of this paper reveals that the
   PtD concept is vital to enforcing the legislation to improve building
   performance and reduce the possible hazards that lead to accidents},

Abstract = {The construction and operation of buildings account for a significant
   part of the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Most design
   approaches to reduce the use of energy are focusing on the operational
   phase of a building's life. Consequently, the embodied energy from the
   upstream flow, including production of building material and components,
   transport and assembly on-site, is often disregarded in the development
   of energy-efficient buildings. The purpose of this research is to
   propose a method to facilitate the assessment of the embodied energy and
   carbon footprint during the design and planning stage from the
   production of building material and components including the
   transportation to site. The framework makes use of Environmental Product
   Declaration (EPD) and supply chain information stored in a relational
   database of building materials and components, Building Information
   Models (BIM) for the assessment of the embedded energy in the building.
   Further, the feature manipulation engine (FME) is used to track
   transportation distances and transportation times from Google Map (GM)
   for the assessment of embedded energy from supplier to the construction
   site. Finally, a prototype is developed to demonstrate the practical
   application of the framework and to observe possible limitations and
   barriers.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {We present a building design optimization methodology that has been
   developed to address issues that researchers and engineers are currently
   facing when addressing the life cycle optimization of Nearly Zero Energy
   Buildings (NZEBs). In order to reduce the required computational time, a
   Kriging model is used to surrogate NZEB performance criteria during the
   optimization process. The error estimation of the Kriging model is used
   for an adaptive sequential design to improve the Kriging model accuracy.
   A genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is considered efficient to find the global
   optimal solutions. We also propose a new algorithm to reduce the
   calculation time even further. The new individuals of the adaptive
   sequential design are filtered with satisfaction functions. It means
   that only the useful part of the Pareto front will be determined.
   Finally, we use network visualization for decision-making. We show that
   this approach is very powerful to help designers find one solution in
   the context of multi-objective optimization. Moreover, the partitions
   can give useful information about the characteristics of the optimal
   solutions.},

Abstract = {As technology developed, the architecture, construction, and engineering
   (AEC) industry was introduced to high-performance materials, integrated
   building systems, and comprehensive processes to improve the performance
   quality of the built environment. As a consequence of that improved
   performance, the design phase of the building life-cycle became more
   complex and comprehensive with all the engineering analyses. To aid this
   process, many engineering analysis and simulation programs were
   designed. However, with the increase in all the various software,
   interoperability problems emerged during the information exchange
   process, which also decreased the efficiency of the design and
   construction phase. This paper includes the first step of interoperable
   prototype development for a three-step analysis. In the light of
   literature review, researchers identified a critical and scalable
   geotechnical problem that is studied on a use case in Central Illinois.
   Geotechnical engineering analysis is found to be suitable to solve the
   limitations of interoperability between geotechnical data and building
   information modeling (BIM) efforts in construction. This research
   contributes to the body of knowledge by developing the basis of a
   geotechnical information model which creates through visualized soil
   boring logs. This virtual database is aimed to be used for calculation
   of soil volume, selection of excavation equipment based on cost and
   schedule information which is critical for excavation processes.},

Title = {Supporting construction stakeholders with the circular economy: A
   trans-scaler framework to understand the holistic approach},
Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although the construction sector is one of the least digitized sectors,
   the last decade has been a period that some qualify as the 4th
   industrial revolution, notably with the adoption of Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). However, the construction industry is still one of the
   most resource-intensive sectors, generating Megatons of waste every
   year. To decrease the impact of the construction on the environment,
   authorities are getting interested in adopting a circular economy (CE)
   approach, including servitization. Although there is an emulsion around
   the circular economy approach, organisational tools to help construction
   practitioners to move to a CE approach are dramatically lacking. The
   purpose of the paper is to develop a BIM-based trans-scalar theoretical
   framework to support practitioners in their understanding and the
   implementation of the CE approach. The trans-scalar theoretical
   framework is established with data extracted from a research portfolio
   fuelled by three main databases, Scopus, RIBA (Royal Institute of
   British Architects) Plan of Work and BIM standards. First, the RIBA
   framework and the information delivery cycle were adjusted to
   incorporate the sustainable end-of-life, as a phase in the CE context.
   Based on theoretical foundations, the main contribution of this paper is
   the trans-scalar theoretical framework developing and clarifying what
   are the main asset lifecycle phases (including the end-oflife), their
   related stakeholders, and the interplays between them, in the UK
   context. The paper also organizes holistically two scales, the asset
   lifecycle phases and the material flow, whether new or recovered, in the
   context of BIM and CE. Some future areas of research are presented,
   including how the BIM-based trans-scalar theoretical framework could be
   improved with inputs from construction experts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {13-38},
Abstract = {The delivery of products and services for construction-based businesses
   is increasingly becoming knowledge-driven and information-intensive. The
   proliferation of building information modelling (BIM) has increased
   business opportunities as well as introduced new challenges for the
   architectural, engineering and construction and facilities management
   (AEC/FM) industry. As such, the effective use, sharing and exchange of
   building life cycle information and knowledge management in building
   design, construction, maintenance and operation assumes a position of
   paramount importance. This paper identifies a subset of construction
   management (CM) relevant knowledge for different design conditions of
   building components through a critical, comprehensive review of
   synthesized literature and other information gathering and knowledge
   acquisition techniques. It then explores how such domain knowledge can
   be formalized as ontologies and, subsequently, a query vocabulary in
   order to equip BIM users with the capacity to query digital models of a
   building for the retrieval of useful and relevant domain-specific
   information. The formalized construction knowledge is validated through
   interviews with domain experts in relation to four case study projects.
   Additionally, retrospective analyses of several design conditions are
   used to demonstrate the soundness (realism), completeness, and appeal of
   the knowledge base and query-based reasoning approach in relation to the
   state-of-the-art tools, Solibri Model Checker and Navisworks. The
   knowledge engineering process and the methods applied in this research
   for information representation and retrieval could provide useful
   mechanisms to leverage BIM in support of a number of knowledge intensive
   CM/FM tasks and functions.},

Abstract = {Input - Output (IO) models can be particularly suitable for assessing
   the impacts of energy efficient lighting systems in the industrial
   sector from a multidimensional perspective. This modelling framework can
   be adjusted to encompass economic, social and environmental impacts that
   can be consistent with different energy policy recommendations. This
   paper is aimed at presenting an IO modelling framework for the appraisal
   of economic, social and environmental impacts of several energy
   efficient lighting systems in the Portuguese industrial sector. A data
   platform has been built based on national IO tables, the number of
   operating days, the lifetime and the investment cost of each energy
   efficient lighting technology considered. The life cycle phases (i.e.
   production and installation, operation and maintenance and disposal) of
   each light efficient technology were further decomposed into their
   corresponding activities. After collecting information on the total
   expenditure connected to each life cycle phase, along with the cost
   share of each relevant activity component as a percentage of the
   respective life cycle phase, it was then possible to calculate the total
   output (in monetary units) of each of these relevant activities. Then
   the net impacts were computed by taking into account the energy savings
   obtained with the energy efficient technologies against business as
   usual technologies, both considering the electricity generation mix in
   Portugal and the corresponding generation cost. Net impacts were
   computed by considering the direct, indirect and induced effects
   obtainable from IO multipliers. In order to grasp the trade-offs between
   economic and energy/environmental concerns regarding each lighting
   project considered we have formulated a multiobjective integer
   programming problem to help select efficient portfolio lighting systems
   and obtained the corresponding solutions considering different public
   supporting strategies.},

Abstract = {Although a considerable number of studies on building information
   modeling (BIM) for facilities management (FM) have been conducted during
   the past ten years, a lack of consensus remains among academics and
   practitioners concerning the successful and practical information
   exchange process between BIM and FM systems. There is a need to
   establish an up-to-date synthesis on the current status of information
   exchange and interoperability between BIM and FM systems. After an
   in-depth review of 113 journal articles published from 2008 to 2018,
   this study systematically presents (1) a holistic review and critical
   reflection on the current status of BIM implementation in FM with a
   focus on information exchange and interoperability, (2) research trends
   and patterns and (3) research gaps and a future agenda in this area.
   Through a bibliometric and content review analysis, this paper concludes
   that the process of information exchange between BIM models and FM
   systems is not a straightforward process, as software interoperability
   remains a significant challenge. Bridging this gap requires standardized
   practical processes to integrate different information sources related
   to maintenance management, health \& safety management tasks and BIM
   data, to provide a rich semantic database to support FM systems.
   Finally, it is hoped that this paper will advocate further developing a
   seamless information exchange process between BIM and FM systems to
   overcome interoperability issues and facilitate BIM implementation in
   FM.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to review and reflect upon the built up scientific
   knowledge on Building Condition Assessment (BCA) using Key Performance
   Indicators (KPIs), supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM), to
   implement appropriate maintenance and rehabilitation activities. For
   this purpose, a literature review related to KPIs applied to BCA and
   using BIM to BCA has been performed. KPIs applied to BCA were studied
   and their calibration and validation methods were identified, as well as
   their potential to support BIM in BCA. Furthermore, current researches
   in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
   applied to the optimization of BCA were also presented. This work
   concludes that despite the studies that have been conducted, only a few
   focuses on KPIs integration in BIM due to some limitations that still
   exist. These limitations are related to the application of BIM on
   building inspections and the limitation of KPIs scope and
   interoperability with BIM. Considering the identified gaps in the most
   relevant research trends on the subject, the present study discusses the
   viability of adjustments on KPIs based on reliable validation and
   calibration methods and combine them to ML algorithms in order to
   develop a more robust BIM-BCA strategy, thereby filling in the
   above-mentioned limitations.},

Abstract = {Implementing circular economy principles in the built environment
   significantly reduces raw material extraction and generated waste. A
   transition is essential, especially as it accounts for 40- 60\% of
   global raw material extraction and 33\% of total waste in the European
   Union. This paper shows the methodological approach to generating a
   digital Building model to enable circular economy in the early design
   stage by coupling Generative Design methods, enabling automated variant
   generation of Digital building models, Building Information Modelling
   objects, and assessment algorithms to evaluate the environmental impact
   and circularity. By visualising the assessments of the generated
   variants of (so-called) Circular Twins in a Virtual Reality environment,
   including user interaction with a voice-controlled Virtual Agent, the
   digital Circular Twin ecosystem enables the early implementation of the
   goals of the circular economy and sustainability in Architecture,

   An Analysis from the Perspective of an Innovation Ecosystem},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ecosystem theory provides a new perspective for studying the development
   of the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) industry in the
   age of information and communication technology (ICT). As an extremely
   ICT innovation, building information modelling (BIM) not only brings
   technical benefits to the AEC industry, but changes the innovation
   paradigm of the AEC industry towards an innovation ecosystem, which
   improve productivity and sustainability throughout the project life
   cycle. This article contributes to innovation ecosystem theory by
   exploring the structure of the BIM ecosystem and deriving its
   cultivation path. Then, as the leading city in China for developing BIM
   technologies, Shanghai was selected as the case study to elaborate on
   the cultivation path of the BIM ecosystem. The results indicate that
   three layers identified in the structure contribute to the understanding
   of the boundaries, units, and analytical focus of the BIM ecosystem,
   with the BIM platform being the core layer. This topology structure,
   with the BIM platform as the hub, promotes interdependency and symbiosis
   among participants in the cultivation of the BIM ecosystem, supporting
   the birth, expansion, maturity, re-innovation (or extinction), and
   sustainable development of the BIM ecosystem. This research complements
   and extends literature on the BIM ecosystem, and provides implications
   as to the construction, cultivation, and sustainability of BIM
   ecosystems for emerging economy firms.},

   Context: A Case Study of Hemp Crop Production},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a methodological approach allowing
   to assess the influence of parameters of one or more elementary
   processes in the foreground system, on the outcomes of a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) study. From this perspective, the method must be able
   to: (1) include foreground process modeling in order to avoid the
   assumption of proportionality between inventory data and reference
   flows; (2) quantify influences of foreground processes' parameters (and,
   possibly, interactions between parameters); and (3) identify trends
   (either increasing or decreasing) for each parameter on each indicator
   in order to determine the most favorable direction for parametric
   variation. These objectives can be reached by combining foreground
   system modeling, a set of two different sensitivity analysis methods
   (each one providing different and complementary information), and LCA.
   The proposed method is applied to a case study of hemp-based insulation
   materials for buildings. The present study will focus on the
   agricultural stage as a foreground system and as a first step
   encompassing the entire life cycle. A set of technological
   recommendations were identified for hemp farmers in order to reduce the
   crop's environmental impacts (from -11\% to -89\% according to the
   considered impact category). One of the main limitations of the approach
   is the need for a detailed model of the foreground process. Further, the
   method is, at present, rather time-consuming. However, it offers
   long-term advantages given that the higher level of model detail adds
   robustness to the LCA results.},

Abstract = {Considerable efforts have been made to reduce buildings' operational
   energy use over the last decades, but little attention has been paid to
   reduce the material transportation and construction energy. Focusing
   only on the operation phase forgoes the opportunity to reduce other
   building-related energy consumption, and even if the environmental
   impacts arising from construction and transportation are small as
   compared to the operation phases, its cumulative impact at the national
   level is of concern.
   The energy consumed by a building is divided into two parts embodied
   energy and operation energy. Further, the embodied energy is constituted
   of energy intensity of materials, energy consumed during transportation
   and energy consumed for construction. This paper proposes a methodology
   to integrate embodied energy consumption into a BIM platform and
   provides a seamless analysis based on available information. Plug-ins
   are developed to fulfill a convenient linkage between the BIM model and
   external databases. Simulation models are created, which can be used as
   templates for energy optimization during transportation and
   construction. By analyzing different resource combination scenarios,
   lower energy consumption can be achieved.},

Title = {Potential use of district heating networks and the prospects for the
   advancements within urban areas of Nottingham as a case study},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},

Abstract = {Buildings in urban areas significantly contribute to global energy
   consumption, necessitating solutions to reduce energy demands and
   mitigate environmental impacts. This study investigates district heating
   networks in urban areas, using Nottingham as a case study. A literature
   review addresses key barriers to decarbonising building energy in the
   UK, focusing on: (1) Information, engagement, and behaviour, (2)
   Strategy, policy, and regulation, (3) Infrastructure, (4) Supply chain
   and skills, and (5) Distribution of costs and impacts. The study
   examines the network's location, current processes, energy performance,
   and potential future impacts. Heat mapping and energy flow assessments
   identify areas for energy savings, guiding system optimisation. The
   findings suggest that increasing the energy output from the heat station
   to the network can enhance performance. The analysis highlights the
   potential of a life cycle perspective for district heating networks,
   proposing a framework that considers all stages from material sourcing
   to system utilisation. This approach helps assess environmental impacts,
   including greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion, identifying
   opportunities to improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental
   impacts. By evaluating current sustainability goals and regulatory
   compliance, the study provides insights into the environmental and
   social implications of the district heating network's operations,
   pinpointing areas for improvement. It emphasises the need for continuous
   optimisation and innovation throughout the network's life cycle. The
   potential of a full life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is highlighted
   to evaluate four main future advancements: (1) heating network with
   added energy storage, (2) advanced system operations through model
   predictive control (MPC) for demand prediction, (3) general network
   improvements, and (4) network expansion. Overall, this study aims to
   enhance the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of district
   heating networks, contributing to the transition towards sustainable
   energy systems while ensuring environmental and economic viability over
   time.},

   systems, it is of scientific and practical interest to substantiate the
   feasibility of using a particular software package. Results. An analysis
   of the functionality of popular software systems for the development of

   technologies (Navisworks Manage, Bexel Manager, Synchro 4D Pro, Asta
   Powerproject BIM, DELMIA) is provided. Their major disadvantages and
   advantages are identified and detailed. Conclusions. The choice of a
   software package by a contractor for the development of a construction
   model (4D model) according to BIM or TIM should be based on an analysis
   of a number of factors, one of which is the technical complexity of the
   construction object. The richer in resources and attributes the building
   is, the more reliable and closer it will be to the real conditions of
   construction, and the less or-ganizational errors will be detected at

Abstract = {The Architectural/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry is slowly
   shifting toward performance-driven project and project delivery.
   Assuring good performance requires efficient performance control
   processes. Among the different construction performance control
   processes, many critical ones, including progress tracking, productivity
   tracking and dimensional quality control, rely on efficient
   three-dimensional (3D) information flows. However, the AEC industry
   currently lacks reliable and efficient means of monitoring 3D
   information at the object level, which is critical to these processes.
   The authors have developed an innovative approach for automated 3D data
   collection (A3dDC) by automatically recognizing 3D Computer-Aided Design
   (CAD) model objects in 3D laser scans. This paper rapidly presents this
   approach and then details how it enables (1) automated life-cycle
   project 3D data collection for integration within Building Information
   Models, and consequently (2) the monitoring processes above to perform
   better. It is also shown how this approach enables planning for 3D
   scanning and ultimately strategic scanning.},

Title = {Energy simulation and modeling for window system: A comparative study of
   life cycle assessment and life cycle costing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {330},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The impact of the window system on building thermal performance is
   considerably complicated. It depends upon several interactive design
   factors and climatic diversity. Unfortunately, there is a lack of
   comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) involving operational thermal
   efficiency with embodied production. Yet upgrading the thermal
   efficiency of windows and cost of energy savings should be justified
   from the additional investment cost. Therefore, the study presents a
   holistic approach for optimizing the windows system integrating
   operational efficiency with comprehensive LCA and life cycle costing
   (LCC). The study employed energy simulation software FirstRate5 over a
   range of energy-efficient windows to assess potential design variables
   for energy expenditure. Performed simulations illustrate the dominance
   of facade insulation (R) above glazing in reducing energy consumption,
   roughly 87\% of the cumulative reduction. However, the provision of a
   zero window is not an optimum solution for permitting daylight and fresh
   air. Thus, an analytical framework has been proposed for glazing to
   ensure thermal efficiency, lower embodied impacts, and
   cost-effectiveness. The resulting Pearson coefficient (r) shows a
   relatively higher thermal conductivity (Uw = 0.39) correlation with
   energy consumptions in a colder climate than hot- and warm-temperate
   environments. Thousands of simulations have been performed to generate
   data for developing linear regression models. In addition, Monte Carlo
   simulations have been conducted to validate the uncertainties of
   developed models. LCC analysis specifies the provision of glazing
   40-68\% of the window to wall ratio (WWR) feasible for optimal
   trade-offs. BIM-enabled LCA (Tally) identifies embodied environmental
   impacts for Aluminium, Timber, Fiberglass, uPVC, and Composite frame
   windows following the ISO 14040-14044 standards. Comparative analysis of
   different framed windows shows the suitability of using uPVC windows
   over others due to less cost, thermal efficiency, fewer environmental
   impacts, recycling possessions, and less energy demand at the
   manufacturing stage.},

Abstract = {Der Einsatz von BIM im Bruckenbau ist aktuell noch uberwiegend auf die
   Phasen Planen und Bauen beschrankt, aber insbesondere fur den Betrieb
   von Bauwerken kann BIM einen grossen Mehrwert erzielen. Grundlage fur
   die Anwendung der BIM-Methode in der Lebenszyklusphase Betrieb ist die
   uberleitung der relevanten Informationen aus den Lebenszyklusphasen
   Planen und Bauen in die Lebenszyklusphase Betrieb. Die Erstellung einer
   modellbasierten digitalen Bauwerksakte wahrend der Leistungsphase 8
   ermoglicht die digitale ubergabe und Weiterverwendung der relevanten
   Informationen fur den Betrieb. Der Beitrag ordnet die Erstellung und
   Nutzung modellbasierter digitaler Bauwerksakten sowohl in den

   Model-based development and implementation of the digital building file
   - BIM from construction to operationThe use of BIM in bridge
   construction is currently limited to the design and construction phases,
   but BIM can be particularly useful for the operation of structures. The
   basis for the use of BIM in the operation life cycle phase is the
   transfer of relevant information from the planning and construction life
   cycle phases to operation. The creation of a model-based digital
   building file enables the transfer of relevant information for
   operation. The article classifies the creation and use of model-based
   digital construction files both in the scientific context and in the
   current working methodology with analog construction files and
   construction files. It also includes the practical implementation of a
   specific project. Furthermore, the reference to the standardized use
   cases 190 ``Project and building documentation{''} and 200 ``Use for
   operation and maintenance{''} is presented. The implementation of the
   model-based digital construction file is demonstrated using the example
   of the Cologne Heumar highway interchange. The objectives and principles
   associated with the use of BIM, the project development and the
   background are discussed. The implementation and handover of the

Title = {Holistic BIM framework for sustainable low carbon design of high-rise
   buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {1091-1104},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {In high-density, high-rise cities such as Hong Kong, buildings account
   for nearly 90\% of energy consumption and 61\% of the carbon emissions.
   Therefore, it is important to study the design of buildings, especially
   high-rise buildings, so as to achieve lower carbon emissions. The carbon
   emissions of a building consist of embodied carbon from the production
   of construction materials and operational carbon from energy consumption
   during daily operation (e.g.. air-conditioning and lighting). While most
   of the previous studies concentrated mainly on either embodied or
   operational carbon, an integrated analysis of both types of carbon
   emissions can improve the sustainable design of buildings. Therefore,
   this paper presents a holistic framework using building information
   modeling (BIM) technology in order to enhance the sustainable low carbon
   design of high-rise buildings. BIM provides detailed physical and
   functional characteristics of buildings that can be integrated with
   various environmental modeling approaches to achieve a holistic design
   and assessment of low carbon buildings. In a case study, the proposed
   framework is examined to evaluate the embodied and operational carbon in
   a high-rise residential building due to various envelope designs. The
   results demonstrate how the BIM framework provides a decision support
   basis for evaluating the key carbon emission sources throughout a
   building's life cycle and exploring more environmentally sustainable
   measures to improve the built environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {State of the art Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) models are typically used to
   relate resource use and emissions to manufacturing and use of a certain
   product. Corresponding software tools are generally specialised to
   perform normalisation of the flows to the functional unit. In some cases
   it is, however, desirable to make use of the LCI model for other types
   of environmental assessments. In this paper, an alternative modelling
   technique resulting in a more flexible model is investigated. We
   exemplify the above by designing and building a model of a cement plant.
   The commissioner's, in this case Cementa AB, requirements on a flexible
   model that generates information on environmental performance, product
   performance and the economic cost were seen as important. The work
   reported here thus has two purposes; on the one hand, to explore the
   possibility for building more flexible LCI models, and on the other
   hand, to provide the commissioner with a model that fulfils their needs
   and requirements. Making use of a calculational a-causal and
   object-oriented modelling approach satisfied the commissioner's special
   requirements on flexibility in terms of modularity and the types of
   calculations possible to perform. In addition, this model supports
   non-linear and dynamic elements for future use. The result is a model
   that can be used for a number of purposes, such as assessment of cement
   quality and environmental performance of the process using alternative
   fuels. It is also shown that by using the above modelling approach,
   flexibility and modularity can be greatly enhanced. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {The goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 requires a massive
   expansion of the use of renewable energy sources like photovoltaics and
   offshore/onshore wind, and the comprehensive electrification of
   transportation and upscaling of the industry. The energy transition thus
   implies an unprecedented scaling-up of the installed power electronic
   conversion capacity. This motivates an in-depth investigation of the
   environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, but also damages
   to human health, ecosystem quality, or resource availability) of power
   electronic systems, whereby the entire life cycle and in particular the
   use phase must be considered. Typically, such Life-Cycle Assessments
   (LCAs) are carried out only for existing products and not during the
   early design phase. In this paper, we therefore extend a multi-objective
   Pareto optimization framework for power electronic converter systems,
   which today typically considers only efficiency and power density as
   performance indicators, to include environmental compatibility metrics
   as additional performance dimensions. After describing the models and
   the data sources used to estimate the environmental footprint of typical
   power electronic components like transistors, magnetic components,
   printed circuit boards, etc., we employ these in a multi-objective
   optimization of an exemplary 10 kW three-phase ac-dc Power Electronic
   Building Block (PEBB) considering two-level and multilevel
   flying-capacitor bridge-legs. First results indicate the importance of
   the mission profile and the available electricity mix during the use
   phase, which may justify selecting a converter design with an initially
   larger environmental burden but better efficiency. Finally, the key
   challenge of LCAs consists in the lack of comprehensive and high-quality
   environmental impact data of electronic components, which thus should be
   addressed by the industry, e.g., by providing such information in future
   smart datasheets.},

Title = {HBIM and Virtual Tools: A New Chance to Preserve Architectural Heritage},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nowadays, architectural heritage is increasingly exposed to dangers due
   to natural disasters or human invasive actions. However, management and
   conservation represent crucial phases within the life cycle of
   historical buildings. Unfortunately, the complexity of conservation
   practices and the lack of knowledge of historic buildings are the cause
   of an inefficient recovering process in case of emergencies. To overcome
   this problem, this research aims to ensure the preservation of relevant
   information through the use of building information modeling (BIM)
   methodology. By developing historic building information models (HBIMs),
   it is possible to enhance the architectural heritage. This represents an
   opportunity to incorporate digital media into the global heritage
   conservation field. To achieve this goal, a historical castle was
   selected as a case study; this unique piece of architecture is located
   in the Piedmont Region, close to city of Turin (Italy). The results show
   a direct relation between a historical digital model, finalized to the
   management of architectural and system components, and visualization
   tools. To conclude, the adoption of this strategy is an effective way to
   preserve and consult information using advanced visualization techniques
   based on augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR).},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {133-144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Pollutants, which are emitted from building materials during the `use
   phase', may have significant adverse impacts on human health. This study
   proposes a methodology for assessing the impacts on human health due to
   pollutants emitted from building materials during the `use phase'. The
   proposed methodology estimates the amounts of pollutants emitted from
   building materials by applying the emission factors measured by chamber
   tests to the emission models. Then, the human health impacts are derived
   by multiplying the intake fraction and human health effect factors by
   the amount of pollutants emitted from building materials. In case study,
   the human carcinogenic potential (HCP) (6.74E-05 case(can)) calculated
   by the proposed methodology was almost identical to the HCP (6.80E-05
   case(can)) calculated by the health risk assessment. It turns out that
   the proposed methodology is capable of producing reasonable results. The
   proposed methodology can be expected to assess the human health impacts
   of buildings more accurately in LCA. In addition, the proposed
   methodology will be useful to improving the indoor environment of
   buildings because it can predict the impacts on human health during the
   building design phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {LEVERAGING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR AUTOMATED INFORMATION INQUIRY
   FROM BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {266-285},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a trending technology in the
   building industry that can increase efficiency throughout construction.
   Various practical information can be obtained from BIM models during the
   project life cycle. However, accessing this information could be tedious
   , time-consuming for non-technical users, who might have limited or no
   knowledge of working with BIM software. Automating the information
   inquiry process can potentially address this need. This research
   proposes an Artificial Intelligence -based framework to facilitate
   accessing information in BIM models. First, the framework uses a support
   vector machine (SVM) algorithm to determine the user's question type.
   Simultaneously, it employs natural language processing (NLP) for
   syntactic analysis to find the main keywords of the user's question.
   Then it utilizes an ontology database such as IfcOWL and an NLP method
   (latent semantic analysis (LSA)) for a semantic understanding of the
   question. The keywords are expanded through the semantic relationship in
   the ontologies , eventually, a final query is formed based on keywords
   and their expanded concepts. A Navisworks API is developed that employs
   the identified question type and its parameters to extract the results
   from BIM and display them to the users. The proposed platform also
   includes a speech recognition module for a more user-friendly interface.
   The results show that the speed of answering the questions on the
   platform is up to 5 times faster than the manual use by experts while
   maintaining high accuracy.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM), which can efficiently manage the
   life cycle of structures, has been increasingly applied in the
   construction industry. However, it is difficult to implement BIM for
   existing structures, due to the differences between the design and
   as-built conditions. Point cloud data (PCD) can be obtained through the
   scan-to-BIM process, which builds a model based on the current state of
   the structure. The scan-to-BIM process is complicated for bridge
   structures and consumes significant time and resources. Therefore, this
   study developed a system to extract bridge design parameters
   automatically to reduce the time and resources for the scan-to-BIM
   process. The proposed automatic bridge design parameter extraction is
   performed in three steps: (1) noise reduction, (2) 3D transformation,
   and (3) parameter extraction. The validation test was conducted on the
   Osong test track fifth bridge in Nojang-ri, Jeondong-myeon, Yeongi-gun,
   Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. The system developed in this study
   successfully extracted the design parameters of the bridge from the PCD
   automatically, resulting in 0.8\% error rate.},

Abstract = {Growing environmental awareness in society increasingly influences
   individual everyday decisions, such as which product to buy or how to
   sustainably use it. Yet, available information to support these
   decisions is often limited, or difficult to understand particularly
   regarding sustainability. Effective ways of communicating environmental
   impacts of individual decisions are required to close this gap. While
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an established tool to evaluate
   environmental impacts of products and services and support environmental
   decision-making, the results are typically standardized and based on
   statistical or averaged data. However, for individuals, this information
   might be irrelevant, as it neglects personal situation, behavior,
   information need, or individual level of expertise. In tackling those
   central issues of personalization in LCA, this article focuses on two
   main questions: How can individual aspects be addressed in LCA and at
   which stages of the methodology can LCA be personalized? For this
   purpose, the ISO 14040/44 standards are analyzed regarding
   individuality, and current approaches in literature are presented. In an
   explorative approach, this research identifies two general approaches of
   personalizing LCA. A personalized Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) enables
   evaluating the environmental impacts of personal(ized) products and
   conditions. A broader personalization approach based on the flexibility
   of the methodological framework of LCA aims at providing understandable
   and relevant results for individual stakeholders. This article provides
   an overview, outlines key aspects of this vision, and points out further
   research needs to bring the concept into application.},

Abstract = {Buildings are a major cause of global resource consumption, greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions and other impacts on the environment, originating
   from both operational energy and material use. Informed design decisions
   can help mitigate potential impacts on the environment, by the use of
   life cycle assessment (LCA) in the early project stages. In order to
   mitigate building environment impacts throughout the industry,
   architects and engineers need tools that are integrated in the design
   workflow and based on the information available. Existing LCA tools for
   building design professionals are predominantly embedded in a specific
   context such as a country or a sustainability scheme. This paper
   provides learnings for the development of context-tailored tools for
   building-LCA using the case of Denmark, with specific focus on
   GHG-emissions that are in focus worldwide. Based on stakeholder
   involvement, four key areas were defined: Default information,
   flexibility, environmental design feedback and transparent results. Tool
   functions include a component library and a quantity estimator for
   bridging incomplete building information. A comparison monitor displays
   the performance of design solutions selected in the model, while a
   number of graphs and tables provide analysis of inventory and results.
   Finally, a customisable model data export, a complete input/output file
   for revision and custom analysis are among key functions for
   transparency.},

Title = {Intelligent Designing and Increasing the Variability of Healthy
   Residential Buildings by Customizing Recycled Polyvinyl Butyral},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Healthy residential buildings represent the future of construction
   concerned with the environment, which is increasingly emphasized. This
   is directly related to the research and development of environmentally
   friendly building materials, which on the one hand meet the specific
   requirements of the builder, and on the other hand do not harm the
   environment. The research is based on the possibility of achieving
   increased variability in healthy residential buildings via the
   customization of recycled polyvinyl butyral using smart technologies for
   sustainable design. This study has two sub-goals; the first and foremost
   is the development and adaptation of recycled polyvinyl butyral to
   increase the elevation of the healthy residential buildings. The second
   objective is to design a methodology, and create databases and
   intelligent designs, via knowledge and building information modeling
   (BIM) technologies. In future research, data on environmental materials
   (such as the abovementioned recycled polyvinyl butyral) should be
   implemented in the knowledge databases that will be methodically
   described in our second sub-target.},

Title = {Heterogeneous network modeling and segmentation of building information
   modeling data for parallel triangulation and visualization},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a promising technology for the
   construction industry, and BIM models have become widely accepted as 3D
   construction models. Currently, BIM data are often organized by product
   level to support cross-platform parallel and real-time visualization.
   However, cross-platform visualization of BIM products with large volumes
   of geometric data still poses a challenge to both triangulation and
   rendering processes. Existing efforts have mainly used geometric
   simplification and geometric data streaming technologies. This study
   addresses this issue from a different perspective by partitioning
   original large-scale BIM products into small BIM sub-products. First, a
   novel heterogeneous geometric relationship model (HeGeo) is proposed to
   categorize BIM relationships into reference, decomposition, and
   association relationships according to Industry Foundation Classes. On
   top of the HeGeo, a strategy for partitioning the geometric data of the
   original BIM products is proposed. Empirical studies were conducted on
   nine BIM models with a BIM product embedding all the geometric data. The
   experimental results showed that the proposed scheme improved
   triangulation efficiency 3.05 +/- 0.57 times with the same hardware
   resources and the same triangulation tool through a parallel computing
   framework and raised the triangular mesh loading efficiency 1.53 +/-
   0.29 times by processing requests concurrently. In addition, the
   proposed scheme improved the user experience of online BIM visualization
   tools through incremental rendering. The segmentation scheme was
   generalized to product-level and floor-level schemes by constraining the
   segmentation nodes to BIM products and floors respectively. Thus, the
   segmentation scheme could be applied to any BIM model and facilitate BIM
   adoption by all stakeholders during a building's life cycle.},

Title = {Recycling Potential Comparison of Mass Timber Constructions and Concrete
   Buildings: A Case Study in China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The recycling potential (RP) indicates the ability of building materials
   to form a closed-loop material flow, that is, the material efficiency
   during its whole life cycle. Mass timber constructions and concrete
   buildings vary widely in RP, but the differences are difficult to
   calculate. This paper proposed a level-based scheme to compare the RP of
   mass timber and concrete buildings, and a BIM-Eco2soft-MS Excel workflow
   coupling Material Cycle Database and digital design tools were
   established to obtain information on building materials, resource
   consumption, and environmental impact for the RP calculation. Taking a
   residential building as an example, the difference in RP between mass
   timber and concrete at the material-level is firstly discussed. Then at
   the component-level, the RP of the wood structure component and concrete
   component is compared, and the optimization methods are proposed.
   Finally, the difference in RP between the mass timber building and
   reinforced concrete building at the building-level are illustrated. The
   results show that the RP of mass timber building is higher, and the
   disassembly ability is better. Within a 100-year service life, the RP of
   mass timber buildings is 73\% and that of the reinforced concrete
   building is 34\%. The total amount of material consumption and waste of
   the Variant CLT is 837,030 kg and 267,237 kg respectively, which is less
   than one-third of that of concrete buildings (3,458,488 kg; 958,145 kg).
   The Global Warming potential (GWP) of these two variants is -174.0
   kgCO(2)/m(2) and 221.0 kgCO(2)/m(2) separately, indicating that the
   Variant CLT can realize negative carbon emissions and gain ecological
   benefits. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the potential
   impacts of certain parameters on GWP and RP of buildings. The research
   can provide the reference for material selection, component design, and
   RP optimization of mass timber buildings. In addition, new ideas for
   assessing the potential of circularity as a design tool are proposed to
   support the transition towards a circular construction industry and to
   realize carbon neutrality.},

Abstract = {Embodied carbon (EC) changes of bridges using PC and RC, were analyzed
   using BIM and One-Click LCA. Identically shaped, concrete bridges (RC,
   PC, superstructure-only PC, and substructure-only PC) were modeled; the
   bills of quantity were extracted and input into the LCA software for EC
   comparison. As a result, it was found that applying PC instead of RC is
   not necessarily a guaranteed method to reduce the EC of bridges.
   Sensitivity analysis on the EC according to concrete waste and material
   transportation distances of all models were conducted. References from a
   carbon perspective were presented for applying PC separately to
   superstructure and substructure. As a result, solutions for the
   application of PC were derived considering the changes in concrete waste
   and transportation distance of concrete inputs. Conclusively, it was
   analyzed that substructure-only PC is effective in reducing EC overall,
   regardless of the amount of concrete waste and transportation distance
   of inputs.},

Journal = {UNDERGROUND SPACE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {59-78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The design of universal segments and deviation control of segment
   assembly are essential for robust and low-risk tunnel construction. A
   building information modeling (BIM)-based framework was proposed for
   parametric modeling, automatic assembly, and deviation control of
   universal segments. First, segment models of different levels of detail
   (LoDs) were built based on BIM visual programming language (VPL) for
   different project life cycles. Then, the geometric constraints,
   requirements, and procedures for parametric segment assembly were
   distilled to develop a program that combines a novel typesetting
   algorithm with a 3D path replanning algorithm. Typesetting is
   implemented by introducing a point indication matrix, characterizing
   segments by sides, and manipulating geometries in a VPL. Simultaneously,
   3D path replanning, with non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) and arcs
   as basic shapes, was used to resolve unacceptable deviation situations
   after typesetting. Finally, the proposed framework was validated on a
   water diversion line and was found to be more effective and accurate

Pages = {490-500},
Abstract = {The present paper presents experiences and ideas regarding the
   implementation of geotechnical engineering within the planning process
   using building information modeling (BIM). As geotechnics or the
   description of the soil conditions are a significant basis for the
   planning process, it is necessary to integrate the 3d soil model(s) into
   the BIM-coordination model. As the development of BIM up to now mainly
   focused on structural engineering, this article discusses BIM in context
   with geotechnical engineering. Different stages of the BIM-soil model
   during a construction's life cycle from planning to removal and new
   construction as well as potentials and problems regarding BIM in
   geotechnical engineering are described. Finally, a short discussion of a
   practical project with high complexity regarding the soil conditions
   shows that many different information components could potentially be
   added in the BIM soil model.
   Therefore, the present paper's main purpose is to demonstrate that the
   implementation of the specialist model ``soil{''} into the BIM overall
   model is necessary and (despite remaining resentments in praxis)
   possible. The necessity and resulting potentials implementing the 3D
   soil model into the BIM overall model are clarified for the reader.
   Furthermore, the aim is to underline peculiarities of 3D soil modelling
   as the subsoil with its typical uncertainties and variations
   substantially differs from other technical disciplines with strict
   definitions of geometry and material. This underlines the special status
   of the soil model within the overall model.},

Abstract = {Europe has numerous historic buildings that need to become more
   energy-efficient, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment to
   fulfill sustainability and use requirements. Asset owners and asset
   managers need to adopt new strategies to protect listed buildings while
   optimizing costs and benefits during their life cycle. In this sense,
   the digital transition proves to be a moment to seize for opening new
   scenarios. The Digital Twin paradigm promises to be valuable for
   enabling the sustainable knowledge, conservation, restoration, and
   management of built assets and solving the dilemma about protecting the
   architectural identity of these buildings while adapting them to the
   functional and performance requirements dictated by the regulatory
   framework. This study proposes a workflow that integrates Heritage
   Building Information Modeling (HBIM) and Building Performance Simulation
   (BPS) tools for data-driving the energy improvement of Italian listed
   modern buildings built between the 1920s and 1960s. After acquiring
   information about the building, the HBIM model and the Building Energy
   Model (BEM) are realized based on the International Foundation Classes
   (IFC) standard. Energy intervention measures are defined, construction
   costs are computed, and benefits during the intervention life cycle are
   predicted in thermal demand. Finally, an expeditious multi-criteria
   analysis allows for comparing different intervention combinations and
   indicating the optimal solution for the energy improvement of the
   building concerning energy, economic, and financial issues. These
   outcomes represent the first step towards realizing a dynamic,
   accessible, and sharable Digital Twin.},

Title = {Use of BIM as a Support for Tendering of Facility Management Services},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Basic 3D models of real buildings are mainly used in the design phase,
   when they serve as a visualization of future projects or as a basis for
   the creation of project documentation. However, the possibilities of
   Building Information Modeling are much wider. The paper presents the
   options available during the tendering for the company's support service
   providers within the framework of Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   The principle is based on defining the necessary content of the Building
   Information Modeling, which would enable a smooth transition between the
   implementation and operational phases. At the end of the implementation
   phase, the model should contain information that could be used for the
   needs of the selection process for facility management service
   providers, which, unlike normal construction production, have many of
   their own specificities, but are necessary for the operation of the
   facility. This information must be entered into the model during the
   entire construction process in the form of defined parameters, a defined
   format and the location of these parameters. The purpose of the Building
   Information Modeling should primarily be the optimization of costs
   during the entire life cycle of the construction project, as well as
   better and clearer availability of information and facilitation of
   cooperation between individual participating entities. Therefore, the
   prerequisite for using the Building Information Modeling as the main
   basis for tendering is its high-quality processing, which places high
   demands on all participants in the investment project.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) and building information modelling (BIM) are proving
   to be valuable tools for managing the entire life cycle of a building
   (LCB), from the early design stages to management and maintenance over
   time. On the other hand, BIM platforms cannot manage the geometric
   complexities of existing buildings and the large amount of information
   that sensors can collect. For this reason, this research proposes a
   scan-to-BIM process capable of managing high levels of detail (LODs) and
   information (LOIs) during the design, construction site management, and
   construction phases. Specific grades of generation (GOGs) were applied
   to create as-found, as-designed, and as-built models that interact with
   and support the rehabilitation project of a multi-level residential
   building. Furthermore, thanks to the sharing of specific APIs (Revit and
   Autodesk Forge APIs), it was possible to switch from static
   representations to novel levels of interoperability and interactivity
   for the user and more advanced forms of building management such as a
   DT, a BIM cloud, and an extended reality (XR) web platform. Finally, the
   development of a live app shows how different types of users
   (professionals and non-expert) can interact with the DT, in order to
   know the characteristics with which the environments have been designed,
   as well as the environmental parameters, increasing their degree of
   control, from the point of view of improving comfort, use, costs,
   behaviour, and good practices. Finally, the overall approach was
   verified through a real case study where the BIM-XR platform was built
   for energy improvements to existing buildings and facade renovations.},

Abstract = {The development of real estates in relation to the design process is
   increasingly based on sustainable aspects in order to ensure the value
   of real properties at an early stage. Due to this aspect, a holistic
   cost-analysis is important, which combines production and user costs for
   the life-cycle cost calculation on the one hand and the identification
   of the expected return and yield during the operating phase on the other
   hand. An automatic combination of the information included in a digital
   model with other complementary indicators is required for an early stage
   cost-analysis. As a result, specifications for the building construction
   and operational aspects may be planned in advance in order to create an
   economically built and operated property ensuring a sustainable value of
   the property. Main purpose of this article is to present this approach

Title = {8D BIM Model in Urban Rehabilitation Projects: Enhanced Occupational
   Safety for Temporary Construction Works},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Featured Application BIM Implementation in the Construction Industry:
   Innovation and Challenges. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a
   relevant booster to the modernization of construction. The adoption of
   digital technologies positively contributes to more agile and integrated
   processes in all phases of the building life-cycle, namely with regard
   to project management activities. The implementation of BIM has been
   predominant in new building projects, but the current market cycle of
   the rehabilitation or refurbishing of existing buildings offers new
   opportunities of application to be explored. This paper explores such
   opportunities, namely with regard to the temporary construction works
   involved in urban rehabilitation projects with the preservation of the
   facades of the original buildings. It specifically addresses the impacts
   of the modeling efforts of steel frames and structures needed to
   temporarily support facades, after the demolition of the old buildings,
   and until the original facade is reintegrated into the structural
   elements of the new building. In a BIM context, an 8D model is created
   to explore BIM capabilities in enabling more efficient occupation safety
   and health coordination and management activities in building
   rehabilitation projects, namely in improving and validating the
   demolitions and construction methods and sequencing, the scheduling of
   construction works, and the mandatory occupational risk prevention
   documents for the construction site. The development of the research was
   supported on the use of the available BIM software: Revit, to model the
   facade and the temporary steel structural system; Microsoft Project, to
   schedule the construction works; Navisworks, to perform clash detection
   analyses and enable visual simulations for occupational risk, and its
   identification and mitigation. The study intends to contribute to the
   dissemination of BIM capabilities to improve occupation safety and
   health in construction, namely in rehabilitation projects involving
   temporary structures while contributing with innovative perspectives
   toward higher maturity in BIM implementation and use in the construction
   sector.},

Title = {An Integrated Framework for BIM Development of Concrete Buildings
   Containing Both Surface Elements and Rebar},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {15271-15283},
Abstract = {As-built Building Information Models (BIM) are increasingly used to
   facilitate the management of all aspects of built infrastructure's life
   cycle. Existing studies mainly focus on automating as-built BIM
   development for surface elements but often ignore embedded elements such
   as rebar due to the inaccessibility with typical sensing devices, such
   as image-based or time-of-flight-based methods. To tackle the issue,
   this research utilizes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) together with the
   photogrammetry method to generate BIMs for in- service buildings
   considering both surface elements (e.g., column, slab, wall, etc.) and
   rebar. As the first step, as-built BIM for surface elements is generated
   and then existing rebar is identified by using GPR. A calibration label
   is designed and attached to elements which are scanned by GPR device,
   and a series of images are captured from those elements and then used
   with other images to generate point clouds. Faster RCNN is then utilized
   to recognize labels among all images. Next, an inverse photogrammetry
   approach is deployed to identify the scanned elements in BIM. By
   matching the recorded timestamps of GPR data and labeled images, links
   between the rebar in GPR data and elements in BIMs are successfully
   established. Finally, IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is developed to
   generate as-built BIM models. Six case studies demonstrate that the
   system is capable of automatically developing as-built BIM, while
   embedded rebar could be efficiently localized and projected into
   corresponding elements in BIM.},

Abstract = {This paper is aimed to providing knowledge and help in discovering types
   of buildings in Casale Castello, by recognizing and understanding their
   structural elements using B.I.M. technology.
   The presented approach allows generating a recognizable digital spatial
   configuration of the main structural elements of buildings in Casale
   Castello village which is examined in this paper through the
   representation of its urban development. Under this perspective,
   analysis and representation of the city building logic and their wall
   types have a noteworthy interest for investigating the guiding principle
   of the town planning evolution through BIM methodology. It is carried
   out the analysis and cataloguing of masonry walls types that testifying
   the development and the reflection of the urban evolution based on the
   constructive techniques. Like for other villages Klaiber, Lavedan and
   Piccinato stated the difficulty to chronologically establish the various
   types of medieval settlement, as well in Casale Castello its impossible
   to find historical documents on its develop. Using B.I.M. methodology
   its easy to recognize the different structural element characterizing
   the buildings in Casale Castello. Through BIM method the digital
   representation became an efficient device for the catalogation and
   structural analysis of constructive elements. BIM is a building design
   methodology characterized by the creation and use of coordinated,
   internally consistent, computable information on building projects
   during the design and construction process. The structural elements
   behavior is analyzed by digital models. It is shown how, using building
   information modeling technology, the modern houses design has become
   more flexible, economic, fast and satisfying than traditional 2D drawing
   representation methods. The information may be refer on full life cycle
   building manufacturing, from design phase to that of use and
   maintenance, passing through the implementation phase.},

Abstract = {Growing awareness of the environmental performance of construction
   products and buildings brings about the need for a suitable method to
   assess their environmental performance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has
   become a widely recognised and accepted method to assess the burdens and
   impacts throughout the life cycle. This LCA-based information may be in
   the form of environmental product declarations (EPD) or product
   environmental footprints (PEF), based on reliable and verifiable
   information. All of these use LCA to quantify and report several
   environmental impact categories and may also provide additional
   information. To better understand on the one hand existing EPD
   programmes (EN 15804) for each country and on the other the recent
   developments in terms of EU reference document (e.g. PEF), the authors
   decided to write this review paper based on the outcomes of the EPD
   workshop that was held prior to SB13 Graz conference.
   This paper presents the state of the art in LCA and an overview of the
   EPD programmes in five European countries (Austria, Belgium, France,
   Germany, Switzerland) based on the workshop in the first part and a
   comprehensive description and comparison of the PEF method and EN 15804
   in the second part. In the last part, a general conclusion will wrap up
   the findings and results will provide a further outlook on future
   activities.
   The high number of EPD programmes underlines the fact that there is
   obviously a demand for assessments of the environmental performance of
   construction materials. In the comparison between and experiences of the
   different countries, it can be seen that more similarities than
   differences exist. A comparison between PEF and EPD shows differences,
   e.g. LCIA impact categories and recycling methodology.
   Independent of raising awareness of the construction material
   environmental performance, the existence of so many environmental claims
   calls for clarification and harmonisation. Additionally, construction
   materials being assessed in the voluntary approaches have to follow the
   harmonised approach following the principles of the European
   Construction Products Regulation (regulated) not to foster barriers of
   trade. The authors therefore highly appreciate the most recent
   activities of the sustainability of construction works (CEN/TC 350
   committee
   Http://portailgroupe.afnor.fr/public\_espacenormalisation/CENTC350/index
   .html) currently working on these issues at the EU level. Finally, the
   LCA community is further encouraged to increase the background life
   cycle inventory data and life cycle inventory modelling as well as the
   meaningfulness of certain environmental impact categories, such as
   toxicity, land use, biodiversity and resource usage.},

Title = {Building demolition waste management through smart BIM: A case study in
   Hong Kong},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {69-83},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Hong Kong's construction industry, known for its massive building
   infrastructure, produces an enormous amount of waste every year, the
   vast majority of which is disposed for landfills. Therefore, some
   effective operational measures and waste management policies have been
   implemented. However, enormous waste remains a concern for stakeholders
   and exert pressure on the limited capacity of Hong Kong's landfills.
   Though previous research discusses Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   application for construction waste management enhancement, the BIM model
   has not been widely implemented for building demolition with waste
   management. Hence, as a response to the aforementioned shortcomings,
   this paper develops a conceptual framework that allows collecting,
   maintaining, and analyzing comprehensive information through Smart BIM
   that uses advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and
   capable of reacting to user activities such as waste quantitative
   assessment, demolition process planning, optimal disposal route
   selection, and waste management strategy are executed. The advantages of
   the proposed framework are shown in a case study benefit-cost analysis
   based on three planned reuse and recycling-rate scenarios that explain
   on-and off-site recycling methods. The results show that the proposed
   framework will pave the way for generating sustainable waste disposal
   practices by providing technical and decision-making support
   functionalities to engineers and planners in the construction industry.},

Title = {Integration of Augmented Reality and Building Information Modeling for
   Enhanced Construction Inspection-A Case Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research addresses a significant challenge in the construction
   industry: the traditional reliance on CAD drawings and manual methods
   for building inspection and monitoring. This article presents a
   transformative proposal utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) to
   revolutionize these processes. The proposed model is based on an
   innovative integration of AR technology with Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), aiming to enhance data life-cycle management and improve
   the efficiency of construction management practices. The main goal of
   the article is to demonstrate the practical feasibility and benefits of
   this AR-BIM integration in construction management, particularly in the
   realms of inspection and monitoring. This involves developing and
   testing an accessible, user-friendly, and affordable AR application
   prototype for mobile devices, employing multiple markers, as a potential
   replacement for traditional methods. The research methodology comprises
   five phases, starting with the conversion of 2D CAD drawings into 3D
   BIM, followed by the simulation of AR-BIM integration at a construction
   site using a commercial AR application. This is succeeded by assessing
   the applicability of the commercial AR app and developing a
   multiple-marker AR application prototype suitable for general platforms.
   The final phase encompasses the testing and evaluation of this
   prototype. The findings suggest that the integration of 3D BIM with AR
   technology is not only feasible, but also beneficial in replacing
   paper-based processes, thereby enhancing information sharing,
   communication, and overall project execution efficiency. However, the
   accuracy of the superimposition between virtual and actual objects needs
   improvement to reduce discrepancies between as-built and as-planned
   scenarios. These results hold significant potential for transforming
   construction project execution by replacing traditional methods with
   more efficient digital solutions. Future research directions include
   extensive testing in various construction scenarios, improving model
   complexity handling, exploring the application of machine learning
   algorithms for data analysis, and expanding the study to encompass other
   stages of the construction lifecycle.},

Abstract = {A building information model (BIM) is an electronic repository of
   structured, three-dimensional data that captures both the physical and
   dynamic functional characteristics of a facility. In addition to its
   more traditional function as a tool to aid design and construction, a
   BIM can be used throughout the life cycle of a facility, functioning as
   a living database that places resources contained within the building in
   their spatial and temporal context. Through its comprehension of spatial
   relationships, a BIM can meaningfully represent and integrate previously
   isolated control and management systems and processes, and thereby
   provide a more intuitive interface to users. By placing processes in a
   spatial context, decision-making can be improved, with positive flow-on
   effects for security and efficiency. In this article, we systematically
   analyse the authorization requirements involved in the use of BIMs. We
   introduce the concept of using a BIM as a graphical tool to support
   spatial access control configuration and management (including physical
   access control). We also consider authorization requirements for
   regulating access to the structured data that exists within a BIM as
   well as to external systems and data repositories that can be accessed
   via the BIM interface. With a view to addressing these requirements we
   present a survey of relevant spatiotemporal access control models,
   focusing on features applicable to BIMs and highlighting capability
   gaps. Finally, we present a conceptual authorization framework that
   utilizes BIMs.},

Title = {Optimising Embodied Energy and Thermal Performance of Thermal Insulation
   in Building Envelopes via an Automated Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) Tool},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Insulation systems for the floor, roof, and external walls play a
   prominent role in providing a thermal barrier for the building envelope.
   Design decisions made for the insulation material type and thickness can
   alleviate potential impacts on the embodied energy and improve the
   building thermal performance. This design problem is often addressed
   using a building information modelling (BIM)-integrated optimisation
   approach. However, one major weakness that lies in the current studies
   is that BIM is merely used as the source for design parameters input.
   This study proposes a BIM-based envelope insulation optimisation design
   tool using a common software Revit and its extension Dynamo to find the
   trade-off between the total embodied energy of the insulation system and
   the thermal performance of the envelope by considering the material type
   and thickness. In addition, the tool also permits data visualisation in
   a BIM environment, and automates subsequent material library mapping and
   instantiates the optimal insulation designs. The framework is tested on
   a case study based in Sydney, Australia. By analysing sample designs
   from the Pareto front, it is found that slight improvement in the
   thermal performance (1.3399 to 1.2112 GJ/m(2)) would cause the embodied
   energy to increase by more than 50 times.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is a collaborative work methodology
   for the creation and management of a construction project. Its aim is to
   centralize all project information in a digital information model
   created by all agents involved in its development. BIM supposes the
   evolution of traditional design systems based on plans, since it
   incorporates geometric (3D), time (4D), costs (5D), environmental (6D)
   and maintenance (7D) information. Furthermore, BIM is not limited to the
   initial design phases, as it also covers the execution of the project
   and even the life cycle of the building. During the last decade, BIM
   methodology has been progressively implemented in different countries,
   becoming a priority for their Public Administrations. Following the
   recommendation of the European Directive of Public Procurement
   2014/24/EU, BIM is progressively being requested in public works, e.g.
   The Spanish Ministry of Public works created in 2015 the National
   Committee of BIM, in which BIM implementation in the architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry and how to introduce it in
   public tenders are being considered. This progressive implementation of
   BIM by public administrations is transforming AEC industry. Therefore,
   universities should include BIM formation in AEC related studies, in
   order to prepare future engineers for this new scenario. In this work, a
   critical review of different approaches for BIM implementation in
   structural design of Civil Engineering Degree is made.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As building information modeling (BIM) has become more widely adopted by
   the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO)
   industry, its undeveloped potential for supporting facility management
   (FM) has become more apparent. In order to fully release the power of
   BIM tools, the first step is to understand and clarify what the
   requirements of the facility management phase are for operations and
   maintenance activities. This paper proposes a process for knowledge
   accumulation and sharing for BIM-FM through the project life cycle. In
   order to collect the initial knowledge for the knowledge database, a
   survey questionnaire was developed and administered to collect
   perspectives from industry practitioners to understand existing facility
   management requirements and the types of maintainability problems that
   frequently occur that have the potential to be solved early on in the
   design phase. The survey results indicated that maintainability issues
   should be taken into consideration during the facility design phase. The
   perceived areas determined by the survey that need maintainability
   consideration in the design phase would be a starting point for a BIM-FM
   knowledge sharing database. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {Knowledge is generated in projects throughout the design and
   construction processes in Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC)
   projects. The management of this knowledge has been implemented by
   various firms in AEC the industry through the development of lessons
   learned databases, best practices, project closeout interviews,
   communities of practice and various other informal techniques. In the
   traditional project processes which don't use building information
   modeling, the data generated through the project life cycle is typically
   stored in a fragmented manner in multiple formats. This makes it
   difficult to capture, catalog and disseminate the knowledge present in
   the data effectively. The objective of the research study described in
   this paper was to identify the ways in which Building Information Models
   can be used for effective Knowledge Management. Building Information
   Models are data-rich, object-based, intelligent and parametric digital
   representations of building structures. In this research, we hypothesize
   that the parametric models used in building information modeling can
   provide a centralized global context to the information stored therein
   and thus be an effective tool as a knowledge store; provide support
   other knowledge management processes. In this paper, we present a method
   to capture knowledge during the design and construction processes using
   the parametric, object oriented nature of the BIM models; extract the
   stored knowledge from the BIM models; present a framework for
   classification and dissemination of the knowledge. Finally, we present a
   framework to enable the use of Building Information Models to support
   the organization wide Knowledge Management processes. (C) 2014 Published

Title = {Integrating building information modeling (BIM) and LEED system at the

Abstract = {Designing environmentally friendly buildings that provide both high
   performance and cost savings is of increasing interest in the
   development of sustainable cities. Today, we are looking at not just
   buildings' certification but sustainable practices that go beyond
   ratings to satisfy our social responsibilities. The construction
   industry in general will benefit from an integrated tool that will help
   optimize the selection process of materials, equipments, and systems at
   every stage of a proposed building's life. Building information modeling
   (BIM) has the potential to aid designers to select the right type of
   materials during the early design stage and to make vital decisions that
   have great impacts on the life cycle of sustainable buildings.
   This paper describes a methodology that integrates BIM with the Canadian
   green building certification system (LEED(C)). Also, it explains how
   this integration would assist project teams in making sustainability
   related decisions while accumulating the required number of points based
   on the applied green building rating system. The methodology depicts the
   implementation of a model that automatically calculates the compiled
   number of LEED certification points and related registration costs for
   green and certified materials used in designing sustainable buildings
   all within the concepts of BIM. Using BIM in this methodology will help
   designers to invent and animate sustainable buildings in 3D mode easily
   and efficiently at the conceptual stage. The design information of the
   proposed sustainable building will be produced in a timely manner by
   using new plug-ins, which are developed for that reason, and which will
   link the BIM model with an external database that stores sustainable
   materials and assembly groups. A real case project is presented to
   illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the proposed model. (C)

Title = {Coupling geospatial suitability simulation and life cycle carbon
   emissions towards uncertain optimization planning for
   wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {321},

Abstract = {Building clean and modern multi-energy complementary systems is a direct
   path to decarbonization in energy sector. The introduction of hydrogen
   energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy
   complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key
   issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen
   multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to
   finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system,
   consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process,
   and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the
   planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the
   following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation
   based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on
   probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration
   optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes
   the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective.
   The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization
   from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the
   system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon
   emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained
   only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional
   distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in
   this study decreased by 82.75 \%. In addition, considering that the
   system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can
   reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 \% but only increase costs by
   about 29.4 \%. The computational results justify the proposed
   optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the
   system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference
   for practice.},

Abstract = {Defect management (DM) inspections play an important role in the overall
   performance of construction projects. Identifying defects early within
   the construction project life cycle leads to mitigating significant
   reworks and potential hazards from occurring later in the building life
   cycle. Despite the importance of DM inspections in construction,
   currently, minimal approaches exist to evaluate or assess the
   performance quality of on-site DM inspectors. To address these issues,
   we present a novel data analysis tool that incorporates Building
   Information Modelling technologies to evaluate DM inspection performance
   using eye gaze data captured during the DM inspection. This paper
   presents an overview of our proposed data analysis tool, which consists
   of a four-dimensional (4D) playback visualisation system and a
   quantitative data analysis simulator. We also present our findings from
   a pilot study that uses our proposed data analysis tool to comparatively
   evaluate the performance of two types of DM inspection approaches:
   conventional paper-based methods, and an experimental Augmented Reality
   (AR) system. We release our DM data analysis software as an open-source
   project under the MIT license.},

Abstract = {The document aims to clarify an efficient methodology for the study of
   the built heritage. This methodology comprises the historical,
   construction and evolutionary aspects regarding the heritage, and also
   includes the chronology of interventions carried out in the historic
   building. The collection and manipulation of graphic information and
   related data will be based on a 3D interoperable graphic model which
   allows managing the information integrated in it, regarding the
   disciplines related to the conservation process and Heritage
   Rehabilitation. Furthermore, the system will widen the management of
   coming information in heritage maintenance, thus fulfilling its life
   cycle.The case study focuses on the Palace of the Children of Don Gome,
   a historic building located Andujar, Jaen (Spain). This work compiles
   and organises data in order to enable an analysis based on a Heritage or
   Historic Building Information Model called the ``HBIM Project{''}. In
   addition, this model will employ precise techniques for the acquisition
   of real geometries, such as photogrammetry, so as to generate a model
   including all relevant and accurate information about a building of
   significant historical and architectural value.},

Abstract = {Estimating costs for decommissioning of nuclear installations (mostly
   reactors) is an iterative process. Ideally, it starts at the design
   phase of a power plant or a research facility. At this stage, the
   preliminary cost estimations are developed, and their accuracy is
   usually low. During the life cycle of the plant or facility the
   decommissioning plans can be developed in a more detailed way, e.g. with
   the support of building information models (BIM) and 3D modeling
   techniques. Then, based on these detailed plans, the estimation of
   decommissioning costs may become more accurate. In this paper, the two
   estimation approaches are presented and evaluated from the perspective
   of using the same 3D model of the nuclear power plant. As the result,
   the recommendations for an effective transition from preliminary to
   detailed planning are presented.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The EU Green Deal, beginning in 2019, promoted a roadmap for operating
   the transition to a sustainable EU economy by turning climate issues and
   environmental challenges into opportunities in all policy areas and
   making the transition fair and inclusive for all. Focusing on the built
   environment, the voluntary adoption of rating systems for sustainability
   assessment is growing, with an increasing market value, and is perceived
   as a social responsibility both by public administration and by private
   companies. This paper proposes a framework for shifting from a static
   sustainability assessment to a digital twin (DT)-based and Internet of
   Things (IoT)-enabled dynamic approach. This new approach allows for a
   real-time evaluation and control of a wide range of sustainability
   criteria with a user-centered point of view. A pilot building, namely,
   the eLUX lab cognitive building in the University of Brescia, was used
   to test the framework with some sample applications. The educational
   building accommodates the daily activities of the engineering students
   by constantly interacting with the sensorized asset monitoring indoor
   comfort and air quality conditions as well as the energy behavior of the
   building in order to optimize the trade-off with renewable energy
   production. The framework is the cornerstone of a methodology exploiting
   the digital twin approach to support the decision processes related to
   sustainability through the whole building's life cycle.},

   of Construction},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries are the
   producers of the most significant waste stream in the European Union.
   Known EU initiatives propose to deal with the issue of construction and
   demolition waste (CDW) according to the principles of a circular
   economy: the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). CDW is generated during
   the whole life cycle of construction. The lack of information about the
   quantity of CDW during the design phase of building needed for
   sustainable design of construction was identified as a research gap. The
   aim of our research is to quantify construction and demolition waste
   during the construction design phase in a circular economy. The proposed
   method is based on the generation rate calculation method. This paper
   describes the proposed methodology for quantifying selected types of
   construction waste: excavated soil, concrete, and masonry. This
   information is essential from the point of view of a sustainable
   circular economy. The main contributions of the paper were identified
   during the decision-making process of sustainable building design,
   during the audit of CDW management, and during building information
   modelling as a support tool for CDW management. As early as the
   construction design phase, there is the possibility of choosing
   technologies, construction processes, and materials that have a higher
   degree of circularity in the economy.},

Abstract = {Existence of diverse sustainable materials with distinctive features
   causes more difficult decision makings for project teams especially when
   it is intended to use ideal materials from diverse types of sustainable
   products. Few research studies have been conducted so far on applying
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) to act as Decision Support System
   (DSS) using of math works functions and tools in combination with
   Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. The main purpose of
   this study is to propose a methodology that integrates BIM with
   decision-making and problem-solving approaches including Fuzzy and
   TOPSIS in order to efficiently optimize the selection of sustainable
   building components at the conceptual design stage of building projects.
   To select the optimum building components, each item is assessed against
   three major attributes of decision criteria as Design, Economic and
   Quality factors, which are applied in Multiple Attribute Decision
   Support System (MADSS) methodology to indicate the various performance
   of buildings sustainability. This BIM-integrated process is linked to
   the engine of Matlab software to apply Fuzzy functions on the users'
   priority in order to automatically suggest the ideal solutions. The
   design alternatives suggested by Matlab is validated by Life Cycle Cost
   (LCC) method to analyze the operational cost of an actual building
   project. Using this innovative method will make the decision-making
   procedure more convenient as well as proposing more realistic and
   reliable final and sustainable optimized choice.},

Abstract = {Today, the generation of smart models and digital archives able to
   accompany the management of architectural assets through the integration
   of advanced 3D survey techniques and Historic Building Information
   Modelling (HBIM) becomes an irremissible added value for the management
   of building life cycle. New international BIM standards are trying to
   give some guidelines to this new digital tool, which has demonstrated a
   wide range of potential applications in digital heritage, structural
   simulation, generative design, site management, restoration and daily
   maintenance activities. To manage a proper 3D reconstruction from point
   clouds, also known as Scan-to-BIM process, BIM experts typically use 3D
   application developed for the management of new buildings, which make it
   difficult to generate complex objects such as historic vaults and
   irregular and damaged walls. For these reasons, this study places the
   heart of its research in the integration of generative modelling in BIM
   application, proposing new Scan-to-BIM modelling requirements for
   complex vaulted systems and a novel add-in ( a set of new
   functionalities for Autodesk Revit) able to improve the generation of
   complex elements from point cloud data. In particular, new modelling
   requirements such as novel grades of generation (GOG) and accuracy (GOA)
   are integrated within the Revit's structure in order to improve the
   level of information connected to HBIM and consequently to support the
   decision making of restoration and rehabilitation projects of complex
   heritage structures.},

   categories, this paper mentions a brief future outline. This review
   study indicates mainly three types of future development directions for
   BIM methodologies, domains and article types: (1) BIM methodologies are
   tending to be developed toward expertise orientation. (2) It is
   suggested that different social science methodologies could be
   implemented using BIM as another kind of expert methodology. (3) The
   ability to continually change and learning capability is the driving
   power of BIM methodologies and will be the key for future intelligent
   applications.},

Title = {Cost-effective design of energy efficiency measures in the building
   sector in North Africa using Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Using sequential search optimisation technique in conjunction with
   Building Information Modeling, this research considers standards and
   easily implemented design and operational energy efficiency measures to
   improve the energy performance of prototype buildings in various
   climatic zones throughout the North African region. This work's novelty
   lies in developing advanced, comprehensive models to propose a new code
   for the building sector that considers different climatic zones and
   types of buildings already in use. In the analysis, design features of
   airconditioned buildings are considered, including window glazing, wall
   construction, roof construction, degree of building orientation, window
   shades, air infiltration level, HVAC equipment efficiency, and lighting
   efficiency. Optimising designs compared to present building construction
   practices in the region may lower energy consumption by 31-56 per cent.
   The analysis's findings show that there is much room to enhance the
   energy performance of buildings in the North African region by
   implementing proven energy efficiency methods and relevant energy
   policies. The requirement for insulation of building envelope
   components, on the other hand, varies according to climatic zone and
   building type.},

Abstract = {The energy performance of buildings directive requires from the European
   Union Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020 all new buildings
   are nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) and after 31 December 2018, new
   buildings occupied/owned by the public authorities should also have the
   NZEB performance. The large-scale deployment of NZEBs represents a
   challenge for all the stakeholders involved in the construction sector,
   where the lack of adequate competences is identified as one of the main
   obstacles. This article aims to provide a solution to overcome the
   deficient competences related to NZEB to increase them by using roadmaps
   derived from Horizon projects - Fit-to-NZEB and Net-UBIEP. Fit-to-NZEB
   aims to increase the knowledge of architecture, engineering and
   construction engineers and workers in deep energy retrofit through the
   education in European qualifications framework levels 3-7, while
   Net-UBIEP seeks to develop the schemes for using building information
   modelling (BIM) throughout the whole building life cycle to increase
   energy performance. The results from both projects show that it is
   inevitable to act soon to make the energy efficiency targets possible to
   fulfil. The integrated design process and strengthen control on the
   construction site should be carried out perfectly as they are the most
   critical parts in delivering NZEBs and all this managed by BIM to
   minimise information loss and to improve the design of details. To
   achieve this, professional competences of all the stakeholders in
   delivering NZEBs must be improved which could be done by implementing
   the knowledge from these projects.},

Abstract = {The Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation is to create a
   centralised knowledge sharing resource that contains all the necessary
   design and operational information about the project. BIM is a
   collaborative approach and integrated project delivery to design and
   delivery embraced by various construction teams in the construction
   projects. In the context of the most suitable project delivery to be
   used, with regards to the use of BIM, the Integrated Project Delivery
   (IPD) approach is highlighted as the best method which correlates
   building procurement of the design-to -construction business process
   through literature review analysis. IPD is developed as project delivery
   system that integrates people in effective collaborative approach
   between the key players in the project. IPD is going to be particularly
   beneficial for BIM because the contracts relation between the
   contractor, designers, consultants, constructors, sub-contractors and
   suppliers were binded and expressly determined at earlier stage. This
   relationship between these two subjects will helped the project team to
   achieve the project goals in terms of timely schedule, life cycle costs,
   quality and sustainability in construction project. Therefore, this
   study investigates on the propensity of the best methodology of project
   delivery system which can correlate with procurement adoption for
   projects adapt BIM concept. This is a descriptive study and the method
   used is based on review of the literature in relation to BIM and IPD.
   The analysis revealed that propensity of adopting IPD project delivery
   and the adoption of BIM are based on these factors: improve the
   communication, closer collaboration; liability and legal relationships
   are specifically determined, the best quality outcome; and lastly with
   reductions in design and construction period, it provides a cost
   effectiveness and a saving in overall construction period.},

Abstract = {Intelligent construction technology has been widely used in the field of
   railway engineering. This work first analyzes the connotation, function,
   and characteristics of intelligent construction of railway engineering
   (ICRE) and establishes its system structure from three dimensions,
   namely, life cycle, layers of management, and intelligent function, to
   deeply understand the development situation of intelligent railway
   construction in China. Second, seven key technical support systems of
   ICRE, which include building information modeling (BIM) standard system
   for China's railway sector, technology management platform and life
   cycle management based on BIM + GIS (geography information system),
   ubiquitous intelligent perception system, intelligent Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) communication system based on mobile interconnection, construction
   management platform based on cloud computing and big data, unmanned
   operation system based on artificial intelligence, intelligent machinery
   and robot, and intelligent operation and maintenance system based on BIM
   and PHM (prediction and health management), are established. Third, ICRE
   is divided into three development stages: primary (perception),
   intermediate (substitution), and advanced (intelligence). The evaluation
   index system of each stage is provided from the aspects of technology
   and function. Finally, this work summarizes and analyzes the application
   situation of ICRE in the entire railway sector of China, represented by
   Beijing-Zhangjiakou and Beijing-Xiong'an high-speed railways. Result
   shows that the technical support systems of the ICRE have emerged in
   China and are still in the process of deepening basic technology
   research and preliminary application. In the future, the ICRE of China's
   railway sector will develop toward a higher stage.},

Abstract = {The pace of changes in the construction industry is constantly
   accelerating. It includes 3D modeling, utilization of drones, 3D
   printing and virtual or augmented reality. Augmented reality combines
   something real, such as existing buildings, with expanded 2D or 3D
   digital information about individual technologies or planned changes,
   and the actual projection of individual elements into a given (even
   hidden) space. It can be a key for improving project engineering
   processes, subsequent maintenance or more efficient renovation
   procedures. Virtual and augmented realities need 3D building models,
   i.e. incorporation of building information modelling. Building
   information modelling (BIM) is a modern and efficient solution process
   that incorporates the entire building life cycle, based on a realistic
   model and information. Individual building technical equipment, i.e.
   including heat sources, to a certain extent influence the internal
   structure of individual buildings, particularly in the case of a more
   complex structures. The article describes some of the modern
   technologies that can be applied to the administration, maintenance and
   implementation of building technical equipment. Such technologies can
   also help when deciding about the most suitable heat source for a given
   building. The article points out the benefits of incorporating these
   modern technologies.},

Title = {A spatiotemporally differentiated product system modelling framework for
   consequential life cycle assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {333},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) applied to systems under
   continuous evolution, such as cities, usually disregard interactions
   among local components, how policy decisions influence them, and the
   value of spatial data. As a result, local environmental impacts might
   not be well-considered. This paper investigates how a spatially explicit
   system dynamics (SD) modelling approach can overcome such limitation,
   contributing to the advancement of CLCA. First, a novel CLCA conceptual
   framework is presented combining consequential life cycle inventories,
   SD principles and the use of spatially explicit data. Second, its
   innovative value is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept SD-CLCA
   model. This model evaluates the environmental impacts of changes in
   electricity supply-demand in the market due to an increasing adoption of
   solar photovoltaic panels (SPV) in residential buildings. It allows
   traceability of both system changes and their environmental
   consequences. For demonstration purposes, the SD-CLCA model is applied
   to Lisbon municipality and the broader electricity market of Portugal.
   Results showcase how SD-CLCA models could provide a closer
   representation of the real effects of predicted changes in the
   electricity market due to different SPV adoption scenarios. They also
   illustrate that changes in gross domestic product, population and
   precipitation provide a diversified set of impact scores. As a
   methodological advancement, and to the net of a few shortcomings, the
   proposed SD-CLCA model is able to capture the complexity of cause-effect
   dynamics determining environmental impacts, which currently represents a
   research gap in LCA.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to illustrate the current situation in the
   Industrial Engineering School in Valladolid regarding the development
   and management of engineering projects using the BIM (Building
   Information Modelling) methodology. It is widely accepted that the
   evolution of information modelling (BIM) is affecting the role of
   professionals in projects and in the management of the project life
   cycle. It is starting to become clear within the university environment,
   that the information modelling of BIM technology must become part of the
   education of future engineers. It uses integrated project delivery to
   respond to the professional demand that requires the development of
   skills in the educational practices to tackle the problems and
   limitations arising in the new practices. The BIM methodology covers
   everything from the project stage to asset management. The proposal of
   its inclusion in the Industrial Engineering School Degree qualifications
   came about in order to stagger the introduction of the student into the
   project process set up through this ``new philosophy{''}.},

Abstract = {Blockchain, as the underlying logic of digital technology, has been
   widely used in many fields of economy and society. The characteristics
   of blockchain technology, such as tamper-proof, decentralization,
   privacy protection, multinode consensus, traceability and verification,
   deeply fit the needs of credible storage, collaborative sharing,
   traceability verification, and confidentiality of electronic archive
   management, and are extremely important for the whole life cycle
   management of electronic archives. In this paper, by collecting and
   labeling key electronic behavior information of electronic archives,
   forming an unstructured labeling system of multidimensional electronic
   archival behavior information. Using cluster analysis and
   Hardtop/Spark-based data processing platform, building a
   multidimensional electronic behavior portrait model based on blockchain.
   Based on the model, key information of electronic archive collection and
   arrangement, appraisal and utilization, statistical verification, etc.
   is stored on the alliance blockchain, so as to build a credible and
   reliable business application and a process tracking system. The
   application and system could help to ensure the standardization,
   intelligence and specialization of archive management under the premise
   of archive security, and solve the current problems that electronic
   archives are easily to be tampered with, unstable in storage, high
   management cost, and difficult to be shared by crossorganizational

Abstract = {Municipalities invest a lot of time and person-hours into manual
   building permit checks. With the increase in computational power and the
   use of Building Information Models (BIM) in the building design life
   cycle, several municipalities are investing in automating these checks
   using BIM and geo-data sets. However, few examples exist of tools
   effectively using geo-information with BIM. In order to address this
   gap, a project was developed with the municipality of Rotterdam (NL). In
   a previous phase, a tool was implemented, able to analyse the BIM data
   to extract the needed information for a few representative regulations.
   In order to extend and improve the previously developed tool, a
   web-based interface is now implemented and geo-data sets are integrated
   to the process allowing more powerful GeoBIM analysis. Three checks
   using both BIM and GIS data were implemented and tested: (i) The parcel
   limit check evaluates if the building's footprint derived from BIM falls
   within the parcel limit provided from the municipalities' parcel data
   sets. (ii) The height check evaluates the maximum building's relative
   height to the road's height. Finally, (iii) the road overhang check
   detects neighbouring roads to the parcel and evaluates the admissible
   overhang over that road. This paper presents these developments,
   including the type of input data that is needed for the checks, the
   tools for the three new GeoBIM checks (parcel limit check, height check,
   road overhang check) and the implementation in the web-based tool.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces ``rebaselining{''} as a workflow for collecting
   reliable and verifiable asset management data for existing facilities
   and infrastructure. Reporting on two action research case studies with
   two public owners in the US, this research structures rebaselining in
   four phases: (1) preparing technology enablers, (2) collecting data from
   existing documents, (3) conducting field verification, and (4) updating
   asset management databases. These workflows address some of the common
   challenges in managing existing assets, including the fast-paced changes
   in asset data requirements, the inaccuracies in data and documentation
   of these existing assets portfolios, and the need to update data and
   documents over their life cycle. The findings set the groundwork for
   implementing workflow by mapping the rebaselining business processes in
   each phase, listing the technological requirements for these processes,
   and explaining the feasibility and examples of customizing building
   information modeling (BIM) platforms for rebaselining workflows. This
   customization of BIM platforms aims to offer simplified solutions that
   reduce the facility management staff's need for advanced BIM software
   knowledge.},

Title = {Enabling rapid prediction of quantities to accelerate LCA for decision
   support in the early building design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Buildings are a significant contributor to climate change. This is why
   life-cycle assessments (LCA) are becoming increasingly popular for
   documenting environmental impacts during the detailed design stages of
   building projects, level of development (LOD) 300-400. In that context,
   wood is gaining recognition as a material that can reduce the embodied
   impacts of buildings. However, of particular concern is the incapability
   of research and practice to generate quantities rapidly in the early
   design stage. It is an underlying key issue for enabling LCA as decision
   support in these early building designs. Therefore, this study's aim is
   two-fold: (i) introducing a simplified design tool for wood dwellings
   and assessing how the predicted early design climate impacts perform
   compared to detailed design case studies (ii) evaluating the root causes
   for predicting trustworthy climate impacts in the early design. The
   LCAbyg tool assessed the impacts of the life-cycle phases A1-A5, B4, B6,
   and C3-C4. The climate impacts of the simplified designs (LOD 100-200)
   were analysed against ten detailed design buildings with the impact
   disaggregated into life-cycle phases, component types and material
   categories. The simplified design tool shows it is reliable for
   comparing the various GHG emissions associated with different designs.
   Still, the total impact is underestimated by an average of 12\% compared
   with the detailed modelling. It primarily arises from the lack of
   simplified design metals and that a single product in a component can
   constitute up to 53\% of the climate impact. So, the LCA is sensitive to
   chosen generic processes, EPDs, and quantities estimations. This study
   points to the critical elements in material quantification and related
   climate impact between simplified and detailed building designs. The
   study also adds to the body of scientific literature on wooden building
   designs by presenting the quantities and GWP results for ten dwellings
   constructed between 2010 and 2021. Terraced houses with specific design
   elements, paper wool, and footing foundation show promising carbon
   reduction abilities here. In addition, the simplified tool has the
   potential to get small and medium-sized enterprises in the building
   industry on board with the sustainability agenda and lead to broader
   adoption of LCA in their practices.},

Abstract = {The problem of data integration throughout the lifecycle of a
   construction project among multiple collaborative enterprises remains
   unsolved due to the dynamics and fragmented nature of the construction
   industry. This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on
   China's special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built
   BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised
   application model that correlates project engineering data and project
   management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social
   networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised
   single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that
   integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the
   adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms
   that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data
   are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation
   and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List
   series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file
   versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real
   applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not
   only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a
   consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction
   project. This system will reduce costs for construction firms by
   providing effective and efficient means and guides to complex project
   management, and by facilitating the conversion of project data into
   enterprise-owned properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Remixing our cities - current research on circularity in the
   construction sector},
Journal = {VLC ARQUITECTURA-RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The European Green Deal is aiming for a transition from the current
   linear economic model to a much more sustainable and resource-efficient
   circular model. Since the construction industry is responsible for 37\%
   of Europe-wide waste, it will be a key sector for the successful
   implementation of this goal. However, we can currently find many
   sector-specific challenges slowing the pace. On the one hand, the
   complexity of the sector and the multiplicity of actors involved. On the
   other hand, the dichotomy between the immanent uncertainty that lies
   within all reuse strategies and an ever-rising pressure for an increased
   technical performance respectively liability exclusion of building
   components. A successful transformation of the construction industry
   towards a circular economy would hence require changes throughout the
   whole life cycle of the building stock, an extensive and comprehensive
   exchange of information and the implementation of strategies for dealing
   with uncertainties. This includes also the development of new
   construction standards, which in turn can be expected to have an
   influence on the resulting architectural design. The focus of this paper
   is to present two current research projects on these topics, with a
   focus on the potential implications and future fields of action for
   designing architects.},

Title = {Renewal strategies of industrial heritage based on placeness theory: The
   case of Guangzhou, China},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Studying the preservation and reuse of industrial heritage can improve
   people's knowledge and understanding of cultural heritage, thus
   deepening their sense of identity and belonging to the local culture.
   This study applies the theory of placeness to protect industrial
   architectural heritage, promote the organic revitalization of urban
   space, enhance local identity, and realize the visualization of tacit
   knowledge. Based on the theory of placeness, this study constructs an
   indicator system for industrial architectural heritage renewal strategy.
   The indicator system includes four primary indicators, namely State of
   Matter, Policy System, Behavior and Spirit, and 23 secondary indicators.
   Exploratory factor analysis is carried out using the post-evaluation
   (POE) method. This study concludes that (1) there are seven strategy
   combinations for industrial heritage renewal, including artistic
   expression, landscape and space, humanistic connotation, industrial
   building, history and culture, architectural features, and construction
   skills. The combination of strategies can enhance the locality and
   architectural originality. (2) The strategy combinations can be used in
   the design, construction, and operation stages of the whole life cycle
   and have been empirically demonstrated in typical projects in Guangzhou.
   Building Construction Atlas, Climatic Suitability, Building
   History/People, and Industrial Equipment have a higher contribution to
   the renewal effect of industrial buildings. (3) The 23 renewal strategy
   elements based on placeness provide new ideas for coding methods of
   historic buildings and modeling of historic building information model
   (HBIM). These strategy elements can be used to construct a knowledge
   graph of historic buildings and visualize tacit knowledge to promote
   sustainable construction and twin city construction.},

Title = {BIM in Structural Project: Interoperability Analyses and Data Management},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a methodology supported on
   technological evolution achievements, and consists of a set of processes
   and tools that allows the creation of a digital three-dimensional model.
   The model centralizes information, in an organized database,
   facilitating the data access and the exchange between the collaborators
   and enterprises along all life cycle of a building. The study is focused
   on the application of BIM within the framework of a structural design,
   identifying the benefits and limitations verified in the process and
   indicating strategies allowing to improve the quality of the project and
   construction. A structural BIM model of a study case was created; using
   BIM based platforms, followed by its transfer to the calculation
   software, where the structural analysis and design were carried out.
   After, using the structural BIM model complemented with the
   reinforcements, several applications and tasks were performed, namely,
   the coordination and collaboration procedures, detection of conflicts
   analyses, production of dynamic drawings, budget estimation and
   environmental impact simulation of the structural framework concerning
   the CO2 emission. In the structural domain, the interoperability is the
   main problem that must be understood and the present study contributes
   to clarify the recurrent limitations. The research also presents the
   capacity of BIM methodology of using the database of the BIM model to
   achieve several types of tasks that normally are associated to the
   structural design. The study demonstrates the significant improvement in
   the quality of the structural design and the wide applicability of the
   BIM model, when compared with the current traditional sequential and
   fragmented process.},

Journal = {INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The use of building information modelling (BIM) has increased in the
   global architecture, engineering, construction and owner-operated (AECO)
   industries. This increased use has contributed to a recognition by
   project stakeholders of its importance across the building life cycle,
   leading higher education institutions to rethink their AECO provisions.
   There has been much debate about how BIM should be employed in
   undergraduate curricula: should it be included as a stand-alone subject
   in a programme or as an underlying theme across the programme? Research
   has also been conducted into theories of practice with regard to BIM
   education. This article builds on previous research in the codeBIM
   project and describes students' perceptions of current practice in the
   United States and the United Kingdom. The article begins with a
   literature review of current theories of BIM teaching in AECO and a
   summary of good practice. The use of focus groups is described and the
   findings from focus group sessions held in the United Kingdom and the
   United States are discussed. The authors identify six key areas required
   for BIM to be inclusive in higher education: collaborative curricula,
   space, teamwork, relevance to the industry, technical/technological
   skills and the role of the professor or lecturer. Each of these areas is
   discussed in light of the findings from the focus groups.},

Abstract = {Across the world, the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   the three-dimensional (3D) model in projects are increasingly frequent
   for supporting design tasks. The digital data embodied in the BIM model

   After giving an overview of the BIM 3D Model data used for planning (4D)
   and costing (5D), the study assesses the level of clarity or confusion
   on what the numbers of dimension refer to after the 5th dimension. A
   systematic review of the different BIM dimensions was conducted
   associated with an online questionnaire sent to various Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction stakeholders across Europe. The online
   questionnaire survey was limited to the 28 European Union (EU)
   countries. Each of the 28 EU countries was represented by at least one
   respondent. The research identified 52 papers considering BIM 4D Model,
   15 considering 5D modelling, 6 considering the 6D Model and 2
   considering the 7D. It was also identified a confusion between academics
   and practitioners for the 6D and 7D BIM dimensions. In fact, 86\% of the
   professionals, actually using 6D, allocate Sustainability to 6D. Whereas
   85\% of the professionals using 7D allocate it to Facility Management.},

Title = {Housing information modelling for BIM-embedded housing refurbishment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {299-314},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify building information
   modelling (BIM) input data sets within a BIM-embedded housing
   refurbishment process and enable construction professionals to use BIM
   as an information management platform for housing refurbishment
   projects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A hypothetical case study using BIM tools
   for a housing refurbishment project is adopted to identify BIM input
   data sets to create a housing information model within a BIM system.
   Reliability of the research outcome is examined by conducting a
   comparative analysis between existing and simulated research outcomes.
   Findings - This research identifies essential BIM input data sets during
   the early design phase. The importance of a well-integrated housing
   information model containing accurate as-built condition, cost and
   thermal performance information is essential to use BIM for housing
   refurbishment. BIM can be feasible for housing refurbishment when an
   information-enriched housing information model is constructed.
   Furthermore, the capability of BIM that can enable key project
   stakeholders to determine the most affordable refurbishment solution
   among various alternatives is identified as BIM can provide reliable
   cost estimations and thermal performance of refurbishment alternatives
   at the early design stage.
   Research limitations/implications - The examined refurbishment processes
   and input data sets are confined to the early design phases as BIM use
   for housing refurbishment is limited.
   Practical implications - This research will contribute to use BIM for
   housing refurbishment by providing essential BIM input data sets and
   BIM-embedded refurbishment processes.
   Originality/value - This research reveals primary housing information
   data sets and BIM-embedded refurbishment processes at the early design
   phase.},

Abstract = {Under accelerated urbanisation and rapid social and economic
   development, environmental pollution has become an important content of
   the construction industry. Therefore, the environmental benefit analysis
   of green buildings is of great significance to the effective use of
   energy and resources and to achieve the goal of protecting resources,
   reducing pollution and improving the ecological environment. The results
   show that the measured results of incremental environmental costs of the
   office building in Taiyuan City in land saving, energy saving, water
   saving, material saving, indoor environmental quality and operation
   management are decreased by 13.56 \%, 11.02 \%, 25.17 \%, 14.43 \%, and
   15.25 \%, respectively; incremental environmental benefits in land
   saving, energy saving, water saving, material saving, indoor
   environmental quality and operation management are increased by 23.15
   \%, 10.37 \%, 19.30 \%, 18.25 \%, and 22.53 \%, respectively. Those
   suggest that the BIM technology applied to the complete life cycle cost
   analysis of green buildings can test, measure and guide all the steps of
   building design, construction and maintenance and largely meet the
   criteria of resource-saving and energy-saving. The results of this paper
   provide a reference for further research on the environmental benefit
   analysis of green buildings based on BIM technology.},

Abstract = {Increasing the service life and durability of structures is an important
   step toward sustainability. Today, the role of carbonation in the
   deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in urban areas is very
   prominent. Conversely, building information modeling (BIM) is an
   innovative tool used for sustainable design, facility management (FM),
   and infrastructure operation. It can provide visual representations of
   damage results that project decision-makers can use for future planning
   to extend the life cycle of structures. This research presents a
   BIM-based framework focusing on the carbonation process and the
   resulting corrosion in rebars. In this framework, by developing several
   plugins, the calculation results of the carbonation and corrosion of the
   rebars in an underground parking structure were transferred to the 3D
   model of the structure. Then, by adding a time dimension to the model,
   4D models and animations were created to visualize the process of
   concrete deterioration. Finally, the calculation results of this
   research and the 4D models can help create a maintenance schedule,
   analyze the time and cost of existing strategies to prevent concrete
   destruction, and provide an integrated plugin used to perform all
   calculations and create animations.},

Abstract = {Recently, kinetic building envelope has been an emerging technology as
   an innovative way to control exterior building environment, but products
   from many researches about the facade could not been reached to the
   industrialization so far. That is because its initial installation,
   operation and maintenance costs are still too high to use for the
   practical field, although buildings using kinetic envelopes could
   decrease their energy consumption significantly. This narrow point of
   view needs to be reconsidered, since buildings require great amount of
   energy to run their functions through the whole life and using better
   building components can lead to achieve much more benefits in aspects of
   the Lifecycle Cost (LCC). This study aims to suggest a standard type of
   the kinetic envelope as a prototype and to reveal its energy efficiency
   by a series of building performance simulations.},

Title = {BIM Approach in Construction Safety-A Case Study on Preventing Falls
   from Height},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction industry has one of the highest occupational accident
   incidence rates among all economic sectors. Currently, building
   information modelling (BIM) appears to be a valuable tool for analysing
   occupational safety issues throughout the construction life cycle of
   projects, helping to avoid hazards and risks and, consequently,
   increasing safety. This work investigates BIM methodology and the
   application of related technologies for building safety planning and
   demonstrates the potential of this technology for the integrated
   implementation of safety measures during the design phase and
   construction site management. The first step consisted of a literature
   review on applying BIM-related technologies for safety in the design and
   planning phases. Following this, to show the potentialities of
   construction simulation, a case study based on BIM 4D to prevent falls
   from height was developed. With BIM 4D, it is possible to follow the
   construction process over time, giving the construction safety
   technicians, designers, supervisors and managers the capability to
   analyse, in each phase, the potential risks and identify which safety
   measures should be implemented. BIM can effectively integrate safety
   measures from the design phase to the construction and use phase and
   enable integrated safety planning within construction planning, leading
   to reliable safety management throughout the construction process.},

Abstract = {An analytical approach is often taken to predict the performance of
   renewable energy systems at a site, but an analytic approach requires
   detailed information on the system to be modeled that is better
   determined during schematic design than guessed-at during pre-design.
   This paper describes a heuristic approach to identify and prioritize
   renewable energy project opportunities before detailed system
   information is available. The method determines the combination of
   renewable energy technologies that minimize life-cycle cost at a
   facility, often with a specified goal regarding percent of energy use
   from renewable sources. Technologies include: photovoltaics (PV); wind;
   solar thermal heat and electric; solar ventilation air preheating; solar
   water heating; biomass heat and electric (combustion, gasification,
   pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion); and daylighting. The method rests upon
   the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) capabilities in:
   characterizing of the empirical cost and performance of technologies;
   geographic information systems (GIS) resource assessment; and life-cycle
   cost analysis. For each technology, simple heuristic algorithms relate
   renewable energy resources at a site to annual energy delivery with
   coefficients that are determined empirically. Initial cost and operation
   and maintenance (O\&M) cost also use empirical data. Economic
   performance is then calculated with a site's utility rates and
   incentives. The paper discusses how to account for the way candidate
   technologies interact with each other, and the solver routine used to
   determine the combination that minimizes life-cycle cost. Results
   include optimal sizes of each technology, initial cost, operating cost,
   and life-cycle cost, including incentives from utilities or governments.
   Results inform early planning to identify and prioritize projects at a
   site for subsequent engineering and economic feasibility study. Case
   studies include industrial sites, military bases, and civic buildings.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to fill the research gap on digital twin
   technology and its broad applicability during construction by shedding
   light on its interaction with Building Information Modeling (BIM) from a
   construction project management perspective. It presented the true
   potential of the digital twins in the construction phase of the project
   lifecycle.Design/methodology/approachThe paper employed a two-step
   methodology that included a comprehensive synthesis of the literature on

   quantitative approach examining the reflection of academic publications
   on the industry and their reception among industry
   professionals.Practical implicationsThe paper provides a meaningful
   definition for the industry by grounding the concept of digital twin in
   existing technologies and their practical applications. This provides a
   roadmap for managers to approach the problems and BIM limitations they
   need to overcome in their companies or projects with tailor-made
   solutions.Originality/valueThe paper is one of the pioneering
   quantitative studies that fulfills an identified need to investigate
   digital twin technology for construction management and its extensive

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The implementation of BIM in FM has been of steadily growing interest
   for academic research. Yet the benefits of BIM for the FM in CREM have,
   to the present day, been explored to a limited extent. As research on
   BIM for FM in CREM remains narrowly investigated, this study follows an
   exploratory approach to formulate implications for further research
   directions. Therefore, a four-stage procedure was adopted: (1)
   identification and definition of BIM uses for FM in CREM; (2) validation
   of the BIM uses for FM in CREM and the expert survey questionnaire; (3)
   assessment of each BIM use's benefit by experts; and (4) analysis of the
   correlations between BIM uses' benefit assessments and the respondents'
   industries, the resulting associations, and the prioritisation for the
   development of BIM uses for FM in CREM. Based on that methodology, it
   was shown that the BIM use for FM in CREM with the highest priority for
   development is 46 Facilities and Equipment: Repair and Renewal. The BIM
   use with the lowest priority is 21 Visualisation. As a result, four
   implications on the development of BIM uses for FM in CREM were
   formulated regarding case studies, information requirements, and
   technical requirements, as well as process and personnel requirements.},

Abstract = {Public construction owner organizations often depend on various funding
   sources to meet their ongoing capital improvement needs, including
   federal, state, and local grant funding. These funding sources typically
   provide usage guidelines and reporting criteria as part of the
   conditions owners are required to abide by for grant disbursement and
   continued eligibility for future funding. This presents challenges to
   the owner in ensuring the appropriate allocation of funding during
   initial project planning, and continued adherence to funding regulations
   throughout the construction phase, particularly during change
   management. This research proposed a methodology for the visualization
   of cost information in building information models (BIM) using BIM tools
   such as Autodesk Revit and Autodesk Assemble. Project parameters within
   the BIM relational database were created to account for the funding
   source information of the model components, enabling the visual
   representation and analysis of embedded project information at later
   stages of model development. This approach was designed to foster
   effective and consistent communication among decision-makers as to the
   apportionment and tracking of facility costs to specific funds. This
   methodology will be applicable to other non-geometric attributes an
   owner may wish to track during a facility's life cycle.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is one of the fastest-growing in the world and
   significantly contributes to economic growth. To maximize profits
   without sacrificing quality, the concept of a successful building
   project should be applied throughout the different stages of a project's
   lifecycle. Although the implementation of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) has been lacking to a large extent in developing nations, a lot of
   studies have been done on BIM usage, awareness, barriers and drivers.
   However, no research has been done on the impact of the BIM barriers
   onBIM usage frequency in the project lifecycle. The research assesses
   the extent of influence of overcoming BIM implementation barriers
   (BIMIBs) on the BIM usage frequency (BF) at the different stages of the
   building lifecycle in the developing world. The study created a
   conceptual model based on a thorough literature review after which, a
   questionnaire survey which collected data from 103 professionals in the
   Ghanaian construction industry was used to perform a Partial Least
   Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The structural
   model adapted 14 attributes across 4 major BIMIBs namely Organizational
   (OB), Cost (CB), Technical (TB) and People (PB) related barriers as well
   as 7 attributes across 3 phase factors namely the PreConstruction (UP),
   Construction (UC) and Post Construction (UPC) phases. In order of
   significance, the study identified TB, PB, OB and CB as the most
   critical BIM implementation barriers that require urgent attention in
   the developing world with path coefficient values of 0.359, 0.314, 0.238
   and 0.199 respectively. Also, with a path coefficient value of 0.848,
   the PLS-SEM results revealed a positive and substantial influence of
   `overcoming BIMIBs(U)' on BIM usage(U) in the project lifecycle among
   professionals in the AEC industry of the developing world. Furthermore,
   the study discovered that, BF at UP ranked first followed by UC and UPC
   with scores of 0.894, 0.855 and 0.803 respectively. Lastly, the
   conceptual, empirical, managerial and theoretical implications of the
   model prediction were examined. Increasing the delivery of
   waste-efficient BIM-enabled projects within the built environment by
   overcoming the identified critical BIMIBs in the developing world is a
   major contribution of the study to the idea of the circular economy. In
   addition, the study's findings will serve as a guide for researchers,
   professionals, and academics in the developing world as they work to
   overcome BIM barriers and to promote BIM usage throughout the project
   lifecycle.},

Title = {Parametric HBIM Procedure for the Structural Evaluation of Heritage
   Masonry Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the architecture, engineering and construction sectors, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM)-based procedures have become adopted more and
   more. In fact, the development of suitable BIM models facilitates the
   management of the design and construction phases and improves the
   efficiency of the maintenance policies during the life cycle of the
   building. Although the BIM method is mostly implemented in the building
   industry for new constructions, in recent years, the deployment of this
   technology has also attracted increasing attention for existing
   structures to rebuild their geometry and gather relevant data,
   especially for historical buildings; in this case, we refer to Heritage
   BIM (HBIM). A HBIM procedure requires a multidisciplinary approach
   involving not only historical, conservation, and restoration
   considerations but also suitable maintenance and repair plans, duly
   balancing the structural needs with the preservation of the historical
   value of the building and its content. Although the integration of the
   structural assessment in the HBIM process would be highly beneficial,
   its practical implementation is often in the early stages. In the paper,
   an original parametric procedure for the assessment of existing masonry
   buildings is proposed in the BIM environment. The procedure combines
   E-PUSH, a software program for the structural analysis of masonry
   structures under seismic and non-seismic actions with an appropriate BIM
   approach, so improving the management of gathered data through cognitive
   phases. The assessment process is, thus, simplified since data required
   for the structural analysis are directly retrieved from the BIM model,
   and the structural analyses and verifications are performed without
   using external programs. The proposed BIM workflow is finally
   illustrated and discussed referring to a relevant case study, the
   seismic vulnerability assessment of the ``Bernardo Rucellai{''} school
   in Florence (Italy).},

Abstract = {Ecological impacts of buildings can be quantified using the method of
   Lifecycle Assessment ( LCA). With the help of digital methods and
   semantic building models (BIM), those impacts can be reduced by
   investigation of variants and their LCA comparison. However, there is a
   large deviation in the results due to inaccuracies in the modeling and
   the calculation tools. This paper proposes an improved workflow of
   BIM-integrated LCA avoiding those inaccuracies. As a first step, various
   sources of error are identified using a model analysis, which is
   examined with 25 models focusing on geometry and materiality. Thereby
   different workflows are investigated, modeling recommendations are
   derived based on the error analysis, and the findings are implemented in
   a prototype. Through an optimized calculation process, the semiautomatic
   calculation of life cycle assessments becomes faster, more consistent
   and more accurate due to the improved integration in BIM.},

Abstract = {Digitalization is one of the most important change processes in this
   century and affects all areas of our society. In the field of civil
   engineering, digitalization offers many potentials for all phases of the
   life cycle of structures, which can be expanded by making data available
   and defining new ways of working with them. Digital methods, in
   particular building information modeling (BIM) and structural health
   monitoring (SHM), offer excellent approaches to satisfy this idea,
   especially for infrastructure engineering structures and can contribute
   to make the structure operation more efficient. The process of
   inspection of infrastructure structures follows fixed deadlines. With
   the help of the presented concept a digitally supported maintenance of
   railway bridges shall be developed by the interlocking of BIM and SHM in
   order to enable a predictive maintenance management and thus to improve
   the reliability of engineering structures over the lifetime. Within the
   framework of concept development, the required methods and processes are
   defined, explained and harmonized.},

Abstract = {Construction industry has become much more complex due to the large
   number of people and documentations involved. As a result, the full
   process of building construction may involve with many different types
   and format of information that needs to collect, document and share. In
   order to share this information between architect, contractor,
   construction manager, etc., there are need to develop a common model
   that can document and store this information in single platform. BIM
   represents a series of parametric objects that composed together to form
   a building model which carries all information includes their physical
   and functional characteristics and project life cycle information. Since
   BIM represent the detailed geometrical and semantic information of the
   building, the application of GIS is needed to manage the construction
   project's information resources. GIS can use information from many
   different sources, in many different formats and can link data sets
   together by common locational data such as coordinate or postal zip
   code. Besides, GIS can use combinations of data sets to build and
   analyze integrated information and also can convert the existing digital
   information into a form that meets the user's need. From this point of
   view, GIS can complement BIM function in order to develop a systematic
   platform for construction purpose. Finding of this study, there are some
   drawbacks in this technique especially in the construction application
   in term of data sharing, data integration and data management.
   Furthermore, the integration of GIS in BIM is studied and potential
   techniques are shown to overcome the drawbacks of the construction
   application.},

Abstract = {Construction material plays an increasingly important role in the
   environmental impacts of buildings. In order to investigate impacts of
   materials on a building level, we present a bottom-up building stock
   model that uses three-dimensional and geo-referenced building data to
   determine volumetric information of material stocks in Swiss residential
   buildings. We used a probabilistic modeling approach to calculate future
   material flows for the individual buildings. We investigated six
   scenarios with different assumptions concerning per-capita floor area,
   building stock turnover, and construction material. The Swiss building
   stock will undergo important structural changes by 2035. While this will
   lead to a reduced number in new constructions, material flows will
   increase. Total material inflow decreases by almost half while outflows
   double. In 2055, the total amount of material in- and outflows are
   almost equal, which represents an important opportunity to close
   construction material cycles. Total environmental impacts due to
   production and disposal of construction material remain relatively
   stable over time. The cumulated impact is slightly reduced for the
   wood-based scenario. The scenario with more insulation material leads to
   slightly higher material-related emissions. An increase in per-capita
   floor area or material turnover will lead to a considerable increase in
   impacts. The new modeling approach overcomes the limitations of previous
   bottom-up building models and allows for investigating building material
   flows and stocks in space and time. This supports the development of
   tailored strategies to reduce the material footprint and environmental
   impacts of buildings and settlements.},

Title = {Towards integrating the ecosystem services cascade framework within the

Abstract = {The assessment of ecosystem services (ES) is covered in a fragmented
   manner by environmental decision support tools that provide information
   about the potential environmental impacts of supply chains and their
   products, such as the well-known Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   methodology. Within the flagship project of the Life Cycle Initiative
   (hosted by UN Environment), aiming at global guidance for life cycle
   impact assessment (LCIA) indicators, a dedicated subtask force was
   constituted to consolidate the evaluation of ES in LCA. As one of the
   outcomes of this subtask force, this paper describes the progress
   towards consensus building in the LCA domain concerning the assessment
   of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems and their associated services for
   human well-being. To this end, the traditional LCIA structure, which
   represents the cause-effect chain from stressor to impacts and damages,
   is re-tasted and expanded using the lens of the ES `cascade model'. This
   links changes in ecosystem structure and function to changes in human
   well-being, while LCIA links the effect of changes on ecosystems due to
   human impacts (e.g. land use change, eutrophication, freshwater
   depletion) to the increase or decrease in the quality and/or quantity of
   supplied ES. The proposed cascade modelling framework complements
   traditional LCIA with information about the externalities associated
   with the supply and demand of ES, for which the overall cost-benefit
   result might be either negative (i.e. detrimental impact on the ES
   provision) or positive (i.e. increase of ES provision). In so doing, the
   framework introduces into traditional LCIA the notion of ``benefit{''} (
   in the form of ES supply flows and ecosystems' capacity to generate
   services) which balances the quantified environmental intervention flows
   and related impacts (in the form of ES demands) that are typically
   considered in LCA. Recommendations are eventually provided to further
   address current gaps in the analysis of ES within the LCA methodology.

Abstract = {The importance of facility management (FM) has gradually been recognized
   in the life cycle of a building. Both new and existing buildings require
   a more efficient approach and advanced technology to improve the
   efficiency of the FM. The study is aimed to enhance the facility repair
   process. Thus, the study presents a building information modeling
   (BIM)-based facility repair platform framework, which enables expedited
   reporting for repairs and a comprehensive listing of the status,
   location, and maintenance record facilities. To effectively facilitate
   the FM information transfer among stakeholders, firstly, the study
   presents a facility traceability coding structure for building
   facilities, the proposed platform framework. The proposed facility
   traceability information coding in QR code format can help general users
   and FM personnel identify and locate the specific or abnormal facility
   quickly. Secondly, the study demonstrates that how to apply the proposed
   code in QR code format in the BIM-based facility repair platform with a
   case test. The research findings showed that the proposed method enables
   FM personnel to significantly improve the efficiency of FM, which can
   help FM personnel make preliminary facility repair judgments and
   schedule maintenance plan to track the status of the facility repair
   which can help improve the efficiency of facility management and

Title = {Extending BIM interoperability to preconstruction operations using
   geospatial analyses and semantic web services},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been used
   through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project
   collaboration and integration of data to support project activities.
   Despite the successful applications of BIM in the design and
   construction stages, the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not
   gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of
   BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the
   planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However,
   this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the
   geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this
   study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction
   project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems
   (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we
   first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web
   data format Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for
   construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial
   and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and
   acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples,
   the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.

Abstract = {Statement of the problem. The subject of the research is information
   models of a complete life project in the sector of architecture, design,
   construction and operation of buildings and structures. The purpose of
   the study is to build a model that implements the forecasting of the
   progress of the calendar plan and optimizes management decisions aimed
   at minimizing the negative consequences of external stochastic impacts.
   Results. An information model of construction based on a vector
   description of basic structures and hierarchical construction of derived
   structures is constructed. All model structures are divided into static
   and dynamic components. Based on the information model, optimal
   algorithms for monitoring the implementation of the calendar plan and
   optimizing management decisions in the conditions of external stochastic
   influences are formulated. Dynamic indexes are obtained that allow
   optimizing both strategic and operational management decisions. The
   optimal monitoring frequency in terms of the cost/return ratio has been
   determined. The software implementation of the algorithms proposed in
   the work in the shell of the relational database management system has
   been performed.
   Conclusions. The results of the study allow us to conclude that in the
   conditions of external stochastic impacts, information technologies
   significantly simplify the dynamic monitoring of the implementation of
   the construction schedule and the development of management decisions.
   The introduction of a vector description of the information model of the
   full life cycle into the practice of the construction industry makes it
   possible to optimize both local models and mechanisms of interaction
   between project participants.},

Abstract = {When designing process-aware information systems, often variants of the
   same process have to be specified. Each variant then constitutes an
   adjustment of a particular process to specific requirements building the
   process context. Current Business Process Management (BPM) tools do not
   adequately support the management of process variants. Usually, the
   variants have to be kept in separate process models. This leads to huge
   modeling and maintenance efforts. In particular, more fundamental
   process changes (e.g., changes of legal regulations) often require the
   adjustment of all process variants derived from the same process; i.e.,
   the variants have to be adapted separately to meet the new requirements.
   This redundancy in modeling and adapting process variants is both time
   consuming and error-prone. This paper presents the Provop approach,
   which provides a more flexible solution for managing process variants in
   the process life cycle. In particular, process variants can be
   configured out of a basic process following an operational approach;
   i.e., a specific variant is derived from the basic process by applying a
   set of well-defined change operations to it. Provop provides full
   process life cycle support and allows for flexible process configuration
   resulting in a maintainable collection of process variants.},

Title = {Toward a national life cycle assessment tool: Generative design for
   early decision support},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The life cycle assessment (LCA) has proven to be a reliable methodology
   for achieving sustainable development. The number of studies and
   attempts of integration at the building design stage is increasing. This
   study is aimed at developing a framework for a national LCA tool that
   considers Egyptian constraints and strikes a balance between embodied
   and operational impacts to serve as a decision-support tool for early
   design. This is achieved by first reviewing and analyzing LCA
   integration methods during the early design stages, emphasizing
   parametric methods. Second, studying the situation of LCA and energy
   efficiency in Egypt through publications, building codes, and
   residential building construction specifications. As a result of these
   steps, a suggested implementation method based on the generative design
   was developed as a tool framework that mainly focuses on residential
   building exterior walls as the first step of the national LCA tool to
   aid the design process and promote sustainable development. In addition
   to being the first initiative for a national LCA tool, the novelty of
   this work is the method of integration compared to other parametric LCA,
   which aims at optimizing both embodied and operational impact with
   respect to the Egyptian conditions while offering multiple solutions.

Abstract = {Construction is a knowledge-intensive industry, in which organizations
   are known for the delivery of products and services, relying on
   different types of knowledge. To manage knowledge effectively, various
   information technology (IT) models and systems have been developed for
   knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry over the years.
   As the next generation of IT application in construction, building
   information modeling (BIM) is increasingly used today to aid KM.
   Compared to generic IT tools, BIM has some distinctive features, such as
   parametric modeling, virtual visualization and centralized platform.
   However, how to apply these features of BIM to better serve KM has not
   yet been well summarized and analyzed. In this research, 115 papers on
   IT-based KM and 73 papers on BIM-supported KM are reviewed, based on
   which an integrated framework is developed to describe the current
   status and future directions for KM in IT-generic and BIM-specific
   contexts. It is followed by a conceptual model of BIM-supported KM which
   shows the possible KM factors and their relationships in the BIM
   environment. This research highlights the transformation from IT-based
   KM into BIM-supported KM. It contributes to the identification of
   remaining challenges to BIM-supported KM and the elaboration of
   BIM-supported KM in construction research and practice. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Reliable data exchange of building information between participants
   across the life cycle of a facility has been a goal of the buildings
   industry for decades. To date, less attention has been given to the
   benefits of data exchange supporting operations and maintenance (O\&M)
   activities than has been given to design and construction activities.
   The primary objective of research project 1609 was to formally specify
   information exchange use cases for O\&M work processes based on existing
   ASHRAE publications, documented according to the format of ASHRAE
   Guideline 20 (2016). Four use cases were developed from ASHRAE Guideline
   4-2008 (RA13), ANSI/ASHRAE/ACCA Standard 180-2012, the ASHRAE Service
   Life and Maintenance Cost database, and ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 105-2014. A
   fifth combined use case, focused on asset management, was then developed
   from the first four. A user's guide was written to help practitioners
   implement a practical asset management program based on this combined
   use case. These products can be adopted by O\&M professionals to bring
   building information modeling (BIM) techniques into their practice and
   make a significant contribution toward the longer-term goal of
   increasing ASHRAE involvement in adopting BIM technologies to support
   its members' work processes.},

Abstract = {Facade greening at the intersection between buildings and urban space
   offers an optimal opportunity to integrate greenery into increasingly
   dense cities and influence the microclimate and contribute to high
   quality of life in urban areas. Despite proven numerous positive
   effects, there is still a lack of implementation and practical relevance
   is low until now. To integrate existing greening systems directly into
   future planning processes and thus keep up with the advancing
   digitalization in the building sector, an integration of these systems
   into Building Information Modeling (BIM) is urgently needed and in
   connection to this, the implementation of an automated planning process
   to support easier realization of greening projects contributing to a
   sustainable urban development. Therefore, BIM objects were created for
   five facade greening systems after analyzing the necessary basic data.
   Subsequently, an automated process was used to optimize the
   time-consuming conventional planning process of facade greening, with
   the aim of evaluating the simulated greening variants based on defined
   parameters. A case study presents the application of the prototypes and
   the possible calculations over the life cycle of the building. This
   development holds great potential by simplifying the process of
   decision-making and placing facade greenery on buildings.},

Title = {Economy-energy trade off automation - A decision support system for
   building design development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building energy simulation is traditionally applied at late phases of
   the design, when most decisions on specifications of building systems
   are made. There has been a growing attempt in the literature to enable
   such simulations at earlier phases of design, when decisions' impact on
   the lifecycle behavior is the strongest. While researchers have
   developed tools/models to support planning and conceptualization phases
   from this aspect; there have been not much developments for early design
   development stage (which is usually the scope of semi-detailed cost
   estimates). This paper introduces a software tool for generating
   multiple design scenarios and evaluating them, by combining energy
   simulation and economic analyses, at schematic design and early design
   development phases of building projects. In this regard, we used
   state-of-the art of open source technologies, as well as cloud
   computing, to integrate energy simulation into the alternative selection
   procedure. The developed system focuses on architectural parameters;
   lighting power density; and heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (HVAC). Analysis of sensitivity of lifecycle energy to such parameters,
   in a group of representative real-world projects, helped us to limit
   variations of such parameters, and subsequently their combinations.
   Using Open-Studio measures and the computational power offered by the
   cloud, our system generates/simulates all possible design scenarios
   (combinations of alternative variations for design parameters); and
   compares them based on building economics performance measures. The
   workflow is showcased in a case study project, by automatically creating
   and evaluating 97 design scenarios, based on economic efficiency and
   liquidity.},

Abstract = {Recently, businesses and government bodies in the Architecture,
   Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector have faced a key challenge to
   the delivery of effective project outcomes. Asset Information Modelling
   (AIM) is a process aimed to serve the asset process once the project is
   handed over. Considering that Blockchain is a new data management
   technology that is intended to provide security within a decentralized
   culture, this could be the foundation for improving asset processes. The
   research is achieved through a systematic review of the relevant
   literature. Several studies have been identified in Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and Blockchain in the construction domain. However,
   there is little research conducted in the context of Asset Management
   Processes (AMP). Skilled people are the main challenge for AIM and
   Blockchain: findings show that a lack of technological awareness and its
   link to the adoption of using AIM and Blockchain in the asset management
   life cycle is the main problem.},

Abstract = {The building sector is still criticized for its excessive energy use and
   negative environmental effects, even with significant improvements in
   recent years. It makes a major contribution to the world's energy,
   waste, and water use. This study investigates the possible benefits of
   using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology in environmentally
   friendly building methods. It also seeks to identify and rank the major
   obstacles to the industry's integration of sustainability and BIM. The
   study aims to accomplish its research objectives by means of a
   questionnaire survey approach. The three primary categories of the
   possible benefits associated with BIM are social, economic, and
   environmental, which correspond to the generally acknowledged elements
   of sustainable development. The provision of a centralized database that
   facilitates the administration of the full building lifetime, less
   material waste, and increased design efficiency have all been noted as
   key benefits. In the building industry, BIM approaches have shown to be
   quite successful in improving sustainable practices. The study does,
   however, point out a few difficulties. The number of people with a BIM
   degree has increased significantly, but there are still not enough
   qualified professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience.
   Project managers with the necessary skills are needed to oversee BIM
   deployment successfully. They should be able to advice and counsel
   clients and other stakeholders on the benefits of BIM. Building
   professionals may maximize the environmental performance of structures
   across their lifetimes and make well-informed decisions by integrating
   sustainability concepts into the BIM process.},

   technologies, standards, vendors and applications. We focus on reusing
   existing approaches and solutions. This article introduces a formal
   model definition as an interface to a building automation system. The
   paper discusses aspects of the modelling with emphasis on the ability to
   manage a building automation system throughout the entire life cycle.
   Most important aspects are related to model flexibility and

Abstract = {Recently, digital mines (DM) have plays an increasingly important role
   in ensuring the safety, effective management and operation of mining
   activities. One of essential pillars for digital transformation in
   mining is Building Information Model (BIM), which is also one of the
   first steps to implement Digital Twin. Additionally, using BIM
   integrated with Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and adopting digital
   technology can provide powerful assistance in life cycle of mining. In
   this study, integrating BIM and TLS point clouds, which is the basic
   framework of DM, was applied to build 3D mining information model as
   well as assessing safety of Nui Beo underground coal mining in Vietnam.
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard is used to define the mining
   information model based on TLS point clouds providing geometric and
   attributive information of the structures. The 3D model was built for
   important structures of the mine, including the mine shaft, and tunnels
   based on TLS point cloud. Additionally, the safety assessment of rail
   tracks in the mine shaft was performed by comparing the TLS point cloud
   of rail tracks and their as-designed BIM models. The results showed that
   the integration of BIM and TLS is a practical solution for the
   information management and safety assessment of underground coal mines.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Both contractual and relational governances affect building information
   modeling (BIM) collaboration and implementation (BCI) to improve project
   performance. However, the mechanism by which these governances and their
   interaction influence BCI remains undetermined. Considering transaction
   cost economics and social exchange theories, this study aimed to
   investigate the extent of the effect of contractual and relational
   governances and their interactions on improving BCI. We developed a
   series of hypotheses and a questionnaire to achieve the aims of the
   study. The partial least-squares structural equation modeling was
   applied to analyze the cause-effect relationship arising from the
   hypotheses. The results show contractual and relational governances
   affect BCI positively. Contractual governance, which consists of
   monitoring elements in safeguarding provisions, positively affect BCI
   and project performance. However, there is no effect found for
   safeguarding provisions that define the rights of parties in the
   contract. The study also reveals that contractual governance does not
   influence relational governance in BCI. This research provides new
   insights to project managers on the use of effective governance
   mechanisms to deliver BIM-enabled megaprojects for improving project

Title = {Optimising building performance through integrating risk management and
   building information modelling during the design process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1233-1267},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to develop a framework for optimising building
   performance through the integration between risk management (RM) and
   building information modelling (BIM) during the design process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   To achieve this aim, a research strategy consisting of literature
   review, case studies and survey questionnaire is designed to accomplish
   four objectives. First, to examine the concepts of design process,
   building performance, RM and BIM; second, to present three case studies
   to explain the role of using RM and BIM capabilities towards optimising
   building performance; third, to investigate the perception and
   application of architectural design firms in Egypt towards the role of
   RM and BIM for enhancing building performance during the design process;
   and finally, to develop a framework integrating RM and BIM during the
   design process as an approach for optimising building performance.
   Findings
   Through literature review, the research identified 18 risks that hamper
   optimising building performance during the design process. In addition,
   11 building performance values and 20 BIM technologies were defined.
   Results of data analysis showed that ``Design budget overrun{''}, ``Lack
   of considering life cycle cost{''} and ``Inefficient use of the design
   time{''} were ranked the highest risks that affect the optimisation of
   building performance. Respondents ranked ``Risk avoid{''} or ``Risk
   transfer{''} as the most risk responses adopted in the Egyptian context.
   In addition, ``BIM As Built{''} was ranked the highest BIM technology
   used for overcoming risks during the design process. These findings
   necessitated taking action towards developing a framework to optimising
   building performance.
   Originality/value
   The research identified the risks that affect optimising building
   performance during the design process. It focuses on improving the
   design process through using the capabilities of BIM technologies
   towards overcoming these risks during the design process. The proposed
   framework which integrates RM and BIM represents a synthesis that is
   novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a
   manner that has not previously occurred.},

Title = {Improving the performance of prefabricated houses through
   multi-objective optimization design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Building prefabrication technology provides opportunities to improve the
   efficiency of construction process; however, there is a missing link
   between building prefabrication and sustainable building design. To
   achieve balanced energy efficiency, economic performance, and
   environmental objectives of prefabricated houses, this research proposes
   a multi-objective optimization framework to minimize building energy
   consumption, costing, and carbon emission. Firstly, based on the
   selected 16 design parameters, the energy performance of 1.89 x 1013
   design solutions is simulated using a BIM model, DesignBuilder, and
   JEPlus coupled with a developed Excel program. Then, multi-objective
   optimization is conducted to optimize comprehensive building energy
   consumption (CVBEC), life-cycle costing (LCC), and life-cycle carbon
   emission (LCCO2), with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) coupled with
   NSGA-II algorithm used to achieve the Pareto optimal solutions. The
   proposed framework is demonstrated in a prefabricated steel house in
   Beijing. Results show that the design solution with the smallest CVBEC,
   LCC, and LCCO2 among the Pareto optimal solutions can reduce the CVBEC
   by 127.4 \%-117.9 \%, LCC by 20.3 \%- 4.5 \%, and LCCO2 by 150.9
   \%-145.5 \%. The PV system sizing is then considered for further
   analysis. Compared to the three Pareto optimal solutions without PV, the
   solution with an 8 kW PV system results in a reduction in CVBEC by 87.6
   kWh/m2, LCC by 84.4 CNY/m2, and LCCO2 reduction of 1121.7 kgCO2eq/m2.
   This research customizes an optimization framework for prefabricated
   houses, which can be quickly solved to obtain the optimal
   energy-efficient design solutions for prefabricated houses in terms of
   energy efficiency, economic performance, and environmental performance,
   and allows designers to know how they should choose prefabricated
   enclosure, building orientation, and photovoltaic (PV) system, etc., and
   therefore can be effectively used for energy-efficient design of
   prefabricated houses.},

Abstract = {Eliminating safety risks at the front end of a construction project
   ranks at the top of the hierarchy of control, and the concept of
   Prevention through Design (PtD) aims to address the life cycle safety of
   workers during the project design stage. Referring to existing safety
   regulations, documents, and best practices, construction safety risks
   and their pre-control measures as well as the relationships among them
   were identified and then stored in a PtD knowledge base. Based on the
   algorithm for extracting and judging specific data information in Revit,
   an automated rule-based inspection plug-in combining Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and PtD knowledge base was developed. The
   developed plug-in sent the feedback to designers through pop-up alert
   windows containing construction risk identification numbers (IDs) and
   the corresponding pre-control measure IDs in the Revit model. The
   effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach were also verified
   by professionals. This research realized accident PtD by integrating the
   BIM and PtD knowledge base; this approach can help to automatically
   assess safety risks during the design phase. Therefore, this approach
   can also increase the willingness and capacity of designers to implement
   PtD and improve safety performance of the construction industry.},

Title = {Project Design and Management of Optimized Self-Protection Plans: A Case
   Study for Spanish Public Buildings},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Featured Application A novel methodology for project management
   applicable for self-protection plans for public buildings based on the
   best practices of technologies, systems, and methods. Self-protection
   plans are the fundamental tool established to prevent and control the
   risks that threaten people and assets. In turn, they are essential to
   provide an adequate response to possible emergency situations that may
   occur in public or private buildings, facilities, or events. In this
   context, current and future challenges advocate increasing the
   usefulness, versatility, and adaptability of self-protection plans. For
   this purpose, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model for the
   project management of self-protection plans with a lifecycle approach.
   The research provides results concerning guidelines, aspects, and
   potential regulations, technologies, tools, methodologies, and
   maintenance frameworks to be followed for any building in different
   project phases. The methodology followed has consisted of a process in
   stages, with literature review and a conceptual development to obtain an
   adaptable model to any public building. The adaptability of the
   framework relies on the definition of potential methods, information
   systems, and technologies that can support any phase during the
   Self-Protection Plan life cycle. Moreover, it was applied in a specific
   environment, such as in public buildings under the Spanish regulation
   using the most common tools and applications available. Results proved
   that although it is possible to make a base model applicable to any
   publicly owned building, there is an extensive and precise subsequent
   work of adaptation to specific cases in which the applicable legal
   framework makes this task challenging. Finally, the results obtained
   have allowed us to reflect on future research needs.},

Title = {Status of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): A Case Study of
   South Korea},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental-impact assessment
   tool has received increasing attention over the years. Unlike the water
   footprint (WF) and carbon footprint (CF) assessments, whose focus is
   only on a single environmental aspect, the LCA systematically analyzes
   the different impacts along the entire life cycle, making possible the
   identification of potential environmental tradeoffs. In Korea, LCA has
   drawn much attention from both industry and academia since the
   mid-1990s. However, the level of Korean-related LCA studies with respect
   to different sectors in the last 20 years has not been analyzed. This
   study, therefore, sought to assess the status of environmental Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies in South Korea. Specifically, the study
   focused on a bibliometric review of LCAs conducted in South Korea in the
   last 20 years and identified potential research gaps. Online searches of
   English-written articles published between 2000 and 2019 were conducted
   on Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, using
   eligible keywords. At the end of the search, about 91 LCA-related
   studies were discovered for South Korea within the study period. The
   majority of these studies focused on the construction (47\%) and energy
   (30\%) sectors, with fewer environmental studies on manufacturing
   (11\%), transportation (9\%), agriculture (2\%), and information and
   communication (1\%) industries. Based on publication trends, results
   show that LCA studies in South Korea have been on the rise in the past
   20 years, even though the number of publications has not followed a
   constant pace. In comparison with the economic sectors of the country,
   reports show an inadequacy in the coverage of major industries of
   growing economic relevance, such as tourism, health, and agriculture,
   suggesting a need to increase and improve LCA-related studies in these
   sectors.},

Title = {Simulation optimisation towards energy efficient green buildings:
   Current status and future trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {254},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly
   recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a
   large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across
   material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing
   computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle
   environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There
   were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in
   various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the
   optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their
   strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges.
   Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the
   computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life
   cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim
   of identifying the current practices and future research need in this
   field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative
   structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were
   compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that
   come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the
   consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building
   systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the
   future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging
   digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and
   parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design
   exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As
   human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become
   important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design
   should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass
   both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {The main purpose of building maintenance management is to enhance the
   safety, value, use, and life of buildings. Integrating appropriately
   advanced hardware and software to conduct regular and preventive
   maintenance for buildings' and their internal facilities' effectiveness,
   functionality and service operations, and meet the needs and comfort of
   users via the most economical maintenance management process is an
   urgent demand for current building technology development. The
   development and application of Building Information Model (BIM)
   technology have covered the life cycle of building, also includes the
   maintenance management section. However, the domestic and foreign cases
   are mostly used in the design or construction stage, as well as
   large-scale or public construction. Not only the residential space for
   most people use every day is few related research, but Taiwan's common
   small-scale residential building is without any discussion. Even the
   relevant requirements of basic maintenance needs are no in-depth study.
   Therefore, this study will be aimed at the maintenance management of
   small-scale residential buildings to summarize and analyze the
   maintenance needs through questionnaires and interviews when the
   construction industry faces the owners' requests. Looking forward to
   developing a complete maintenance management tool that satisfying users'
   needs in the near future.},

Title = {Knowledge-based OpenBIM data exchange for building design},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building design is highly complex as it involves numerous professionals
   and their interactions, hence with diverse tools used and
   multi-resources and different structured data and information required
   to be processed. Despite the existing efforts to develop multi-objective
   decision making tools to support complex design, most of the research
   face difficulties to provide holistic, dynamic and collaborative
   knowledge base due to the complexity of the information interoperability
   issues across different parties and throughout life cycle. This paper
   developed an automatic data exchange framework that combines only the
   necessary data from BIM models using semantic web technology to
   eliminate inefficiencies in data exchange and improve decision-making
   early in the design stage. The proposed data acquisition method can
   produce a dynamic knowledge base to connect both static and dynamic
   information. A multi-objective knowledge base was developed to assist
   engineers associated with sustainability and cost in comparing different
   design options based on the existing BIM data. The proposed ontology was
   developed using a machine-readable format, allowing the ability to add
   more concepts to it in the future and work with other automated tools.
   The validated framework could reduce human involvement and errors while
   providing more efficient ways to leverage diverse information sources
   together to support holistic decision-making for building design.},

   however, are not enough to monitor a large amount of SHM data and
   conduct systematic decision making for future maintenance. In this
   paper, a bridge health monitoring system is developed through the
   combination of building information modeling (BIM) and traditional
   bridge health monitoring that can organize and visualize a considerable
   amount of sensor data and subsequent structural health information over
   a prolonged period. The system can identify the structural damage by
   evaluating the data from sensors using Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD)
   in bilinear time-frequency analysis. A BIM-enabled platform is utilized
   to develop the proposed visualization tool for a long-span bridge and
   enable automated sensor data inventory into the BIM environment. The
   system has been tested for its robustness and functionality against the
   development requirements, and the results showed promising potential to
   support more effective bridge information management.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a framework for collaboratively evaluating facade
   retrofit designs in-situ using Augmented Reality (AR). Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) tools have been seeing increased use, driving
   the collection of detailed information throughout a building's life
   cycle. AR combines the visible real-world with superimposed
   computer-generated information, for example, permitting users to
   visualize proposed changes and simulation data while on-site. Our
   approach combines these disruptive technologies into a design tool for
   early-phase facade retrofits through to the final design. This method
   enables us to address a range of design and retrofit scenarios improving
   daylighting, energy efficiency, and aesthetics of a structure while
   maintaining a building's function and comfort. Our system will enable
   architects, engineers, and facility stakeholders to explore viable
   design options that satisfy construction and retrofitting project goals.
   Our framework is applied to a demonstration office and conference room
   retrofit project illustrating the potential for interactive in-situ
   redesign evaluation.},

Abstract = {3D Architectural printing is produced by combining 3D printing
   technology with architectural design and construction technology. In
   this paper, its supporting technologies, including building information
   modeling, materials modeling, digital manufacturing and virtual
   manufacturing technology are reviewed and summaried, and its research
   status and development trends are analysised. Building information model
   BIM uses IFC interface as its information exchange standard, integrates
   building geometry, physical, structure, economic information and so on,
   provides services for building design, construction and management
   stage, and builds full life cycle model; Contour Crafting uses concrete
   for printing materials, builds the entire house automatically under
   control of computer. D-Shape printing technology uses fine aggregate and
   cement materials as printing materials, forms a sturdy stone buildings
   with specific shape. Multiple Material Modeling combines building
   structure with a variety of building materials according to its
   geometric distribution, and it is the important basis of 3D
   architectural printing. Besides, CNC manufactures building components
   automatically. Virtual manufacturing stimulates construction process
   using visualization technique, tests design flaws, finds clash of
   construction, so as to guarantee implement of minds of the designer. In
   the final part of the paper, 3D Architectural Printing is regarded as an
   ideal numeric control way for building construction, which does great
   help to raise the level of automation, energy saving and environmental

Abstract = {Fragmentation of practices is one of the key issues in the built
   environment However, with advances in Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT), particularly cloud computing, the fragmentation of
   working practices can be potentially overcome. The technology could
   enhance communication and information flow in various stages along a
   project life cycle. Due to the increasing demands and the newly
   developed cloud computing applications, it is critical to review and
   identify the appropriate cloud computing applications in the built
   environment A total of forty two cloud computing applications consisting
   of general cloud applications, Building Information Modelling (BIM), and
   project management cloud applications were selected and critically
   reviewed. A decision-making model was also developed to assist parties
   in selecting a suitable application. The explanatory case study has
   discovered numerous possible cloud computing applications in various
   disciplines, for example, Google Apps, Autodesk BIM 360, and Viewpoint
   are the applications with the most features. The findings contribute to
   creating a certain awareness and an insight to reduce the fragmented

Title = {Developing a BIM GIS-Integrated Method for Urban Underground Piping
   Management in China: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Underground piping remains one of the key uncertain infrastructures in
   urban development. Because they are buried underground without a clear
   vision, the management of the underground piping system is more
   complicated than other infrastructure. Their records are not usually
   fully available or accurate, and excavation to validate underground
   structures is often needed in infrastructure projects. Detection of
   unexpected obstacles may lead to project delay, increased time spent,
   and risk of damaging existing piping. The traditional underground piping
   system management relies on computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and
   historical empiricism. Still, it cannot meet the strict requirements of
   infrastructure management nowadays or make the management efficient and
   sustainable because of the technical limitations and conceptual
   obsolescence. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper proposes an
   innovative method that aims to manage the underground piping life cycle.
   This method is to develop a building information model (BIM) in a
   geographic information system (GIS) environment by integrating
   heterogeneous data from both BIM and GIS, which not only achieves
   three-dimensional (3D) visualization but also seamlessly connects to
   portfolios, programs, projects, and assets throughout the life cycle of
   urban underground piping. This is a critical development to integrate
   and analyze geometric and nongeometric information of aboveground and
   subsurface building assets and the surrounding environment to stimulate
   interaction with real-world context. This paper also introduces a case
   study in China to further prove the feasibility of this method and the
   format based on it in practice. In the case study, the proposed method
   is implemented together with a piping sensor to further illustrate the
   effectiveness of the method over trenchless detection and real-time
   monitoring for daily management of underground piping. Because the model
   is visible and the monitoring is in real time, the management would be
   straightforward. At the same time, this method can analyze, plan, and
   monitor activity, so the management of urban underground piping systems
   would become smart. Therefore, an efficient and sustainable management
   performance can be achieved. This method is meaningful for managing the
   urban underground piping system, especially for those with expansion,
   refurbishment, or maintenance for an urban underground piping system.},

Abstract = {Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) has received wide coverage
   within the research, academic and industry communities over the last
   decade. Yet, its degree of integration with various industry standards
   in the architecture, engineering and construction sector varies
   extensively. An exploratory research approach explores the
   interoperability between the construction design and management (CDM)
   regulations and BIM. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach The research design comprised: a methodical
   ``state-of-the-art{''} review of extant literature - exploring some 19
   variables emerging from the literature review; detailed content analyses
   of the current CDM regime (CDM 2015); and conducting a ``test{''} to map
   and determine the degree of interoperability between BIM and CDM. The
   study develops several meta-matrices and a framework for BIM and CDM
   interoperability. Findings New insight reveals that BIM provides a
   systematic approach for the discharge of CDM obligations. The framework
   developed is easily transferable into BIM common data environments
   (CDEs) and offers an expeditious discharge of CDM obligations. Research
   limitations/implications - Some features of the developed BIM/CDM
   interoperability framework invite further tests to predicate the degree
   of discharge of CDM obligations. Duties related to provision of
   pre-construction information invite further research. Originality/value
   Little research provides insight into the interoperability of BIM and
   the CDM regulations. Therefore, this study contributes to the knowledge
   relating to the degree of interoperability of BIM in construction
   systems, processes and standards.},

Title = {Developing Mobile- and BIM-Based Integrated Visual Facility Maintenance
   Management System},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {Facility maintenance management (FMM) has become an important topic for
   research on the operation phase of the construction life cycle. Managing
   FMM effectively is extremely difficult owing to various factors and
   environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of 2D graphics
   when depicting maintenance service. Building information modeling (BIM)
   uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the maintenance
   service of facilities depicted in 3D object-oriented CAD. This paper
   proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FMM using
   BIM technology. Using BIM technology, this study proposes a BIM-based
   facility maintenance management (BIMFMM) system for maintenance staff in
   the operation and maintenance phase. The BIMFMM system is then applied
   in selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to
   verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FMM
   practice. Using the BIMFMM system, maintenance staff can access and
   review 3D BIM models for updating related maintenance records in a
   digital format. Moreover, this study presents a generic system
   architecture and its implementation. The combined results demonstrate
   that a BIMFMM-like system can be an effective visual FMM tool.},

   to use the graph theory and the Liebich metaphorical barrel. The
   proposed approach allows to use the principle of cybernetics, according
   to which the product, at each stage of its life cycle, is presented in
   the form of a set of separate elements connected with each other in a
   single information network. The joint use of the graph theory and the

   visually displaying them in the complex. The main advantage of this
   approach is the ability to illustrate which of the set of quality

Abstract = {Environmental impact studies within the built environment rely on
   predicting building lifespan to describe the period of occupation and
   operation. Most life cycle assessments (LCAs) are based on arbitrary
   lifespan values, omitting the uncertainties of assessing service life.
   This research models the lifespan of American residential housing stock
   as a probabilistic survival distribution based on available data from
   the American Housing Survey (AHS). The log-normal, gamma, and Weibull
   distributions were fit to demolition data from 1985 to 2009 and these
   three models were compared with one another using the Bayesian
   information criterion. Analysis revealed that the estimated average
   housing lifespan in the United States is 130 years given model
   assumptions, although a probabilistic approach to lifespan can yield
   higher accuracy on a case-by-case basis. Parameters for modeling housing
   lifespan as log-normal, gamma, and Weibull survival functions are
   published with the intent of further application in LCA. The application
   of probabilistic housing lifespan models to community-wide turnover and
   integration with existing simulations of natural disaster are proposed
   as potential ways to achieve community sustainability and resilience
   goals. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {The level of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide climbed to a new record of
   30 billion tons in 2010. In 2011, at the COP17 U.N. Climate Change
   Conference in Durban, South Africa, high-ranking representatives from
   around the world met again to discuss solutions. For the building
   sector, numerous energy-efficiency market changes and benchmarking
   resolutions, like the mandatory E.U. ``nearly Net-Zero-Energy-Building
   (NET-ZEB's) 2018 and 2020 regulations{''} for all new public and
   privately owned buildings are now set up to help minimizing carbon
   emissions and reverse the negative impact.(1) In the United States, the
   American Institute of Architects (AIA) adopted the 2030 Challenge as a
   voluntary program, where participating buildings aim to achieve a 90\%
   fossil fuel reduction by 2025, and carbon-neutrality by 2030.(2) To
   accomplish these energy goals, designers must strive to best design and
   utilize the resources available on a site. However, are these goals of
   achieving carbon-neutral buildings possible? How can NET-ZEB's become
   the curricular standard and practical routine in education and the
   profession? To date, the basic curricular design process components with
   integrated project delivery metrics for a robust 3-D/4-D-net-zero
   regulatory design framework are either incomplete or missing, However,
   formally-based curriculums have begun to weave carbon-neutral design
   tools into their pedagogy. This research paper critically compares how
   these new criteria for digital 3-D-building information modeling (BIM),
   and ``Integrated Project Delivery{''} are mandating a better integration
   of collaborative carbon-neutral designs into the curriculum and practice
   of the profession.
   The majority of those in architectural academia have been using
   generative computation primarily for pure, aesthetic form-finding,
   without applying zero-carbon-energy-driven global performance metrics
   and CO2e reduction strategies to reiterate derived carbon-neutral
   designs. The advantage of 3-D-parametric design is that it links
   variables, dimensions, and materials to geometry in a way that when an
   input or simulation value changes, the 3-D/4-D model automatically
   updates all life-cycle scenarios and components simultaneously.},

Title = {Achieving leanness with BIM-based integrated data management in a built
   environment project},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-487},
Abstract = {Purpose Although various concepts and techniques are introduced to the
   built environment to achieve a substantially efficient building
   production, the effective application of these methods in projects is of
   immense significance to the field of building construction. Among these
   initiatives, lean construction and building information modelling (BIM)
   are mainstream endeavours that share many common principles to improve
   the productivity of the built environment. This study aims to explore
   and explain how BIM-based integrated data management (IDM) facilitates
   the achievement of leanness in a built environment project.
   Design/methodology/approach This research is conducted through an
   ethnographic-action research that relies on the design-science approach
   and case study through a collaborative research project. As participants
   of the project, the researchers of this study cooperate with the
   practitioners to design the project approach and production workflows.
   Research data and evidence are obtained via participative observation,
   including direct observation, results of activities, unstructured
   meetings and self-analysis.
   Findings In this study, the project and production perspectives clarify
   the building design and production process, as well as analyse how BIM
   facilitates the achievement of leanness in building design and
   construction. BIM-based frameworks for IDM have been developed to handle
   miscellaneous information and data, as well as enhance multidisciplinary
   collaboration throughout the project life cycle. The role of the
   integrated BIM model as an information hub between the building design
   and building construction has been identified.
   Research/limitations implications The project and production views of
   building and construction are used in this study because the research
   purpose is to link the BIM-based IDM to lean construction. Although this
   mixed approach can slightly undermine the theoretical foundation of this
   study, a substantially comprehensive understanding can be gained as
   well.
   Practical implications This study provides a new perspective to
   understand how BIM-based IDM contributes to lean construction.
   Originality/value This study provides new insights into IDM in a built
   environment project with project and production views and presents
   BIM-based frameworks for IDM to achieve lean construction through the
   BIM process.},

Title = {Achieving parametric transparency in model-based factory planning},
Journal = {PRODUCTION ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The planning of new factories, as well as the re-planning of existing
   factories, has become more frequent due to increasingly changing
   business requirements, as for example shorter product life cycles and
   Industry 4.0. A higher number of involved planners and the resulting
   high amount of planning information strongly require coordination. In
   this context, the importance of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in
   factory planning rises as it provides a method of integrated building
   planning and planning validation by means of 3D software and
   object-oriented modelling. However, despite the use of BIM, there are
   still major interface problems in factory planning that cannot be solved
   by the still manual plausibility checks of non-geometrical planning
   information. To enable automatic checking of planning results, thereby
   improving the BIM-based factory planning process, machine-readable
   explication of the parametric dependencies are required between
   different planning fields such as production planning and building
   planning. The goal of this paper is to show parametric and thus
   non-geometric dependencies that exist between the sub-models of
   BIM-based factory planning in such a way that software agents can
   automatically evaluate this design information. Within the planning
   interface between production planning and building planning, the paper
   focusses on the particular exchange between the planning of the
   manufacturing system and the planning of a cutting fluid pump. With the
   involvement of domain experts from factory planning, systems engineering
   and production engineering, we as the authors have managed to develop a
   coherent system of block diagrams, constraint diagrams and parametric
   diagrams that explicate the focused interface in a machine-readable
   manner. We believe our accomplishments are an essential element for
   completely automated planning validation in BIM-based factory planning
   and general object-oriented modelling in the future.},

   Projects Using As-Built BIM Models},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, are
   emerging to improve decision making based on learning. Their use applied
   to the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector,
   together with the increased use of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology in all phases of a building's life cycle, is opening up a
   wide range of opportunities in the sector. At the same time, the need to
   reduce CO2 emissions in cities is focusing on the energy renovation of
   existing buildings, thus tackling one of the main causes of these
   emissions. This paper shows the potentials, constraints and viable
   solutions of the use of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence
   approaches at the design stage of deep renovation building projects
   using As-Built BIM models as input to improve the decision-making
   process towards the uptake of energy efficiency measures. First,
   existing databases on buildings pathologies have been studied. Second, a
   Machine Learning based algorithm has been designed as a prototype
   diagnosis tool. It determines the critical areas to be solved through
   deep renovation projects by analysing BIM data according to the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC4) standard and proposing the most convenient
   renovation alternative (based on a catalogue of Energy Conservation
   Measures). Finally, the proposed diagnosis tool has been applied to a
   reference test building for different locations. The comparison shows
   how significant differences appear in the results depending on the
   situation of the building and the regulatory requirements to which it
   must be subjected.},

Title = {Implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the Procurement Process
   of Buildings: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The construction industry adds a high share to global CO2 emissions and,
   thus, to the global climate crisis. Future buildings need to be planned,
   constructed, operated, and deconstructed in a lifecycle-oriented manner
   so that the building stock represents a capital asset for future
   generations. The greatest leverages for reducing a building's CO2
   emissions lie in the early project phase and subsequently in the
   tendering and awarding process, which makes early Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) indispensable. In this study, we set a sociological research
   framework consisting of (i) choosing a research topic, (ii) conducting a
   literature review, (iii) measuring variables and gathering data, (iv)
   analyzing data, and (v) drawing a conclusion. Since there are countless
   studies that apply LCA in the construction sector for environmental
   assessment, emission reduction, or decision support, we posed the
   question of whether LCA was also applied in the public building
   tendering and awarding process. Furthermore, we focused on identifying
   obstacles to LCA implementation in this early project phase. Therefore,
   we applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a Systematic Literature
   Review (SLR). The results show that numerous articles focused on
   sustainable tendering or green public procurement in the construction
   industry; however, the LCA method is scarcely used in the procurement
   processes (19 articles in the final sample). Based on our findings, the
   main obstacles to LCA implementation in the procurement process are
   highlighted in the study. In the future, the mandatory integration of
   LCA into the procurement process will be crucial to reduce the CO2
   emissions generated by the construction industry and thus contribute to
   the EU climate target plan to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050.},

Title = {BIM-Based Building Geometric Modeling and Automatic Generative Design
   for Sustainable Offsite Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Offsite construction is gaining attention due to government policies
   promoting automation and productivity. Therefore, understanding the
   impact of building design on construction cost and the carbon footprint
   associated with offsite construction is important for the improved
   sustainability and climate resilience of the built environment. This
   study aims to develop a system approach, with the aid of building
   information modeling (BIM), for 3D geometric modeling and automatic
   generative design toward optimizing the carbon footprint and
   construction cost from offsite construction. A mathematical formulation
   is proposed to represent the topological relationships between different
   kinds of precast and cast-in-situ elements, which in turn, underpin 3D
   geometric modeling for possible geometric variations within precast
   buildings. New generative algorithms are developed to automatically
   manipulate building geometrics subject to pre-defined constraints, and
   create parametric BIM models in compliance with material types assigned
   by users. A BIM-based automation tool is developed to extract and match
   the model geometry/material information with a customized BIM object
   library, through which carbon emission factors and cost coefficients can
   be retrieved for multi-criteria sustainability analysis. The proposed
   new approach empowers 3D geometric modeling and geometry-based design
   automation, which enable comprehensive exploration of design alternates
   in precast construction. The proposed new method is illustrated via a
   case study that investigates the impact of different design variations
   on embodied carbon and construction cost of precast structures. The
   proposed BIM development takes around 30 minutes to create 1,000-1,500
   new design options. Besides, it produces design options that contain a
   30\% less carbon footprint and construction cost than reference
   buildings from the literature. The results indicate that our proposed
   method can support automated design exploration at early stages, which
   help to identify optimal solutions for more informed decision making.},

Abstract = {Purpose Using the current state of life cycle assessment (LCA), carbon
   and water footprinting, and EPDs in South Africa, this work explores the
   challenges and opportunities for scholarly development in these areas in
   the country. Methods Being a relatively small LCA community in South
   Africa, academics, consultants, and other stakeholders were approached
   to provide lists of known studies, with further reports, that may have
   been missed, obtained through internet searches. Information was
   collated on database development, capacity building, and other aspects
   and presented here in a single paper. Results and discussion While the
   authors are aware of companies working on LCA and related studies,
   hidden in confidential reports, we were able to find 27 LCA, 17 water
   and 12 carbon footprinting, and 10 EPD studies. Although these studies
   have potential advantages for policymaking and business, their number,
   implementation, and impact remain limited. Conclusion While previously
   seen as an academic exercise, life cycle thinking has been adopted by
   industry, private consultants, and the South African National Cleaner
   Production Centre (NCPC-SA), among others. Growing interest has led to
   the creation of several training courses available at academic
   institutes, the NCPC-SA, and consulting firms, ranging from the basic
   understanding to advanced use of software packages and modeling
   techniques. The development of a national LCI database and further
   exposure and opportunity for LCA studies are important steps to
   hopefully spur LCA in Southern Africa in the future.},

Abstract = {Purpose The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change
   the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset
   data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of
   things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this
   revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated
   workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site
   manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information,
   interoperability, transparency and ``big data{''} management are the
   main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst
   organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by
   utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or
   human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management
   of the data generated are not safe or reliable.
   Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in this paper
   addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present.
   Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility
   to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in
   all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these
   technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such
   as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment,
   will support information traceability from the strategic definition to
   end of life. Findings The framework of this study presents an excellent
   opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of
   new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established
   platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of
   digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the
   supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work
   together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of
   these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and
   digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic
   supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to
   stakeholders and users. Practical implications This study provides an
   exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite
   manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire
   life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value This paper
   contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use
   in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for
   future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these
   technologies and their workflows.},

   INFORMATION MODELING BASED ON MODEL USES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {561-574},
Abstract = {This study aimed to provide guidance in adopting BIM, specifically in
   determining the level of development of the components in a model. The
   main objective was to identify the information items to be included in a
   model based on the required BIM uses. Semi-structured face-to-face
   interviews were conducted with nine professionals to identify the
   information items that are required for the selected BIM uses. The
   professionals filled out a form by selecting the required information
   items from a list of component properties for specific BIM uses. The
   responses were analyzed to determine the most frequently selected
   information items for each BIM use. The results were validated via
   literal replication and external validation. The main properties that
   were most frequently selected were determined for two types of building
   components, duct and pipe, and limited to five BIM uses. The study
   revealed that the most frequently selected properties and related BIM
   modeling effort varied based on the BIM use/s required in different
   project types. The list of identified information items can be used by
   the practitioners when defining the properties required to prepare a BIM
   model for the selected BIM uses. The practitioners can utilize the
   findings of this study to increase their efficiency in adopting BIM and
   decrease the time and effort loss and cost overruns while adopting BIM.
   Although the previous studies emphasized that determination of the right
   level of development from the very beginning of the construction process
   is critical, guidance on which information items are required are
   lacking in the literature. This study provided guidance on how the
   required properties of elements that are going to be included in a BIM
   model changes based on BIM uses. Future studies can investigate the
   information needs required for other types of components and for other
   BIM uses.},

Title = {BIM Roles and Responsibilities in Developing Countries: A Dedicated

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) through data-rich digital
   representation has revolutionized the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry. BIM implementation in the AEC industry has
   noticeably increased over the last decade. Various BIM roles have been
   discussed in the literature to ease the process of BIM implementation,
   but the BIM roles related to project delivery methods have not been
   standardized. Stimulated by this need, this study develops a BIM roles
   and responsibilities matrix (BIM-R\&R) in the context of the
   design-bid-build (DBB) projects for developing countries. A
   comprehensive literature review has been conducted, followed by a
   questionnaire survey comprising 105 responses. The results were analyzed
   to formulate a BIM-R\&R matrix, on which the expert opinion was obtained
   from the BIM experts. The proposed BIM-R\&R matrix describes all the
   roles and their corresponding responsibilities required along the
   project life cycle phases of DBB projects. The incorporation of BIM
   roles in the DBB procurement process will aid in the efficient
   management of all information and data that may be lost due to the
   fragmented nature of DBB. BIM roles with enhanced communication and
   coordination will also help in reducing time and cost overruns while
   maintaining a high-quality product. This study helps the associated
   construction industry in its efforts to implement BIM on their projects
   by providing a method by which to assess which BIM roles are necessary.
   Moreover, it will provide project and construction managers with a clear
   understanding of the BIM roles in DBB projects.},

Abstract = {This paper applies, extends, and verifies a model-driven framework for
   managing carbon footprint of a construction project using a case study
   approach. Current construction management practice lacks methods to
   track carbon footprint of the construction phase since the application
   of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods has remained primarily limited to
   design and operation phases of a project. In addition, the current
   methods heavily rely on user inputs on materials and the state of
   planned-vs.-actual work-in-progress. The presented framework addresses
   existing inefficiencies by leveraging 4D building information models
   (BIM) in conjunction with LCA tools to benchmark carbon footprint during
   pre-construction phases and monitor it during the construction phase.
   The management framework-built on earned value management
   concepts-offers metrics to assess and communicate deviations between
   benchmarked and actual carbon footprint, and facilitates root-cause
   assessments to minimize performance deviations, and excessive carbon
   footprints. As a full proof-of-concept, an extended case study is
   conducted on a real-world project. The application of the proposed
   management framework as a mechanism for increased environmental product
   data in the supply chain, establishing policies requiring adherence to a
   carbon footprint budget during project tendering, and incentivizing
   reductions in carbon footprint through a cap-and-trade scheme are
   discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {At present, the capability to collect information from different sources
   {[}building information modeling (BIM), sensors, assets database] for
   asset management (AM) use has generated significant opportunities for
   asset owners and facility managers. BIM, in particular, is considered as
   a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project
   information during the building life cycle, providing a common data
   environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information
   availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data
   integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment
   of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and
   distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the
   interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of
   which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM
   processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM
   in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The
   research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data
   required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop
   an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to
   implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a
   critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group
   interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were
   conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy
   information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in
   that can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be
   submitted to facility managers to improve AM processes.},

Title = {Engineering-out hazards: digitising the management working safety in
   confined spaces},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {196-215},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to report upon the further development of a
   hybrid application programming interface (API) plug-in to building
   information modelling (BIM) entitled confined spaces safety monitoring
   system ``CoSMoS{''}. Originally designed to engineer-out environmental
   hazards associated with working in a building's confined spaces (during
   the construction phase of a building's life-cycle), this second
   generation version is expanded upon to use archival records to
   proactively learn from data generated within a sensor network during the
   building's operations and maintenance (O\&M) phase of asset management
   (AM). Design/methodology/approach An applied research methodological
   approach adopted used a two-phase process. In phase one, a conceptual
   model was created to provide a ``blueprint map{''} to integrate BIM,
   sensor-based networks and data analytics (DA) into one integral system.
   A literature review provided the basis for the conceptual model's
   further development. In phase two, the conceptual model was transposed
   into the prototype's development environment as a proof of concept using
   primary data accrued from a large educational building. Findings An
   amalgamation of BIM, historical sensor data accrued and the application
   of DA demonstrate that CoSMoS provides an opportunity for the facilities
   management (FM) team to monitor pertinent environmental conditions and
   human behaviour within buildings that may impact upon occupant/worker
   safety. Although working in confined spaces is used to demonstrate the
   inherent potential of CoSMoS, the system could readily be expanded to
   analyse sensor-based network's historical data of other areas of
   building performance, maintenance and safety. Originality/value This
   novel prototype has automated safety applications for FM during the
   asset lifecycle and maintenance phase of a building's O\&M phase of AM.
   Future work is proposed in several key areas, namely, develop
   instantaneous indicators of current safety performance within a
   building; and develop lead indicators of future safety performance of
   buildings.},

Abstract = {Organisations increasingly rely on data-driven strategies, utilising
   analytics to achieve competitive advantages. This paper systematically
   investigates the integration of big data into Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction

   systematic and bibliometric analysis, it synthesises findings from 125
   records published 2013-23. While many studies are at preliminary stages
   with conceptual or small-scale experimental approaches, the paper
   categorises its results into four domains: AEC organisational
   infrastructure, big BIM data (IT) infrastructure, AEC organisational
   strategic domain, and big BIM data (IT) strategic domain, aligned with
   the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM), exploring organisational
   competencies, governance factors, and strategic frameworks. This paper
   introduces the AEC Organisational - Big BIM Data SAM as the research
   agenda to implement big BIM data utilisation across AEC industry. This
   framework thoroughly addresses organisational dynamics while emphasising
   interconnectedness among individual projects, organisational tiers, and

Abstract = {`Smart cities' are a new type of city where stakeholders are jointly
   responsible for urban management. City Information Management (CIM) is
   an output tool for smart city planning and management, which assists in
   achieving the sustainable development of urban infrastructure, and
   promotes smart cities to achieve the goals of stable global economic
   development, sustainable environmental development, and improvement of
   people's quality of life. Existing research has so far established that
   blockchain and BIM have great potential to enhance construction project
   performance. However, there is little research on how blockchain and BIM
   can support sustainable building design and construction. Therefore, the
   aim of this paper is to explore the potential impact of the integration
   of blockchain and BIM in a smart city environment on making buildings
   more sustainable within the context of CIM/Smart Cities. The paper
   explores the relationships between blockchain, BIM and sustainable
   building across the life cycle stage of a construction project. This
   paper queries the Web of Science (WoS) database with keywords to obtain
   relevant publication, and then uses the VOSviewer to visually analyze
   the relationships between blockchain, BIM, and sustainable building
   within the context of smart cities and CIM, which is conducted in
   bibliometric analysis followed by micro scheme analysis. The results
   demonstrate the value of this method in gauging the importance of these
   three topics, highlighting their interrelationships and identifying
   trends, giving researchers an objective research direction. Those
   aspects reported in the paper constitute an original contribution.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Various BIM capability and maturity models have been developed to assist
   architecture, engineering, construction and facilities management
   (AEC/FM) organizations in measuring the performance of their BIM
   utilizations. Due to differences in applicability and focus of these
   models, they are able to meet the demands of different BIM users. In
   this study, eight BIM capability and maturity models identified in the
   literature are compared based on several different criteria. The results
   show that there is no holistic model that includes process definitions
   that cover the facility life-cycle and contains measures for assessing
   all of these AEC/FM processes. A reference model for assessing BIM
   capability of AEC/FM processes was developed. It was grounded on the
   meta-model of ISO/IEC 330xx family of standards and developed
   iteratively via expert reviews and an exploratory case study. It
   includes AEC/FM processes which were evaluated using the BIM capability
   levels, their associated BIM attributes, and a four-point rating scale.
   BIM-CAREM was evaluated by conducting four explanatory case studies. The
   results showed that BIM-CAREM was capable of identifying BIM
   capabilities of different AEC/FM processes.},

Title = {Design patterns for BIM-based service-oriented architectures},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {59-71},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Today Integrated Project Delivery together with Building Information
   Modeling is being realized as a process of managing a project over a
   single shared information backbone. In the near future, Building
   Information Models (BIMs) will be used as unique resources for enabling
   seamless data level interoperability, which will greatly facilitate the
   processes in the Building Life Cycle. In this context, enabling the
   collaborative use of BIMs is becoming essential and is much required by
   the industry for addressing the issues associated with the poor
   efficiencies in Information Systems (IS) and productivity. On the other
   hand, in the new IS architectures, service and resource orientation are
   becoming widely used, in terms of supporting collaboration over
   distributed environments. This paper introduces three design patterns
   which will help in facilitating BIM-based information sharing over the
   web, and web-based collaborative use of the BIMs. The patterns were
   developed to formalize the approaches in interacting with the shared
   BIMs over the web. The first pattern - BIM AJAX - explains how AJAX
   techniques can be used for supporting information retrieval from BIMs.
   The second pattern - BIM SOAP Facade - provides a standard
   coarse-grained interface to reach multiple BlMs over the web. The third
   pattern - RESTful BIM - elaborates on how BIM-based systems can benefit
   from the REST (Resource Oriented) Architectures. The paper starts with
   providing an overview on Building Information Models focusing on their
   characteristics and functions. Following this, the conventional
   approaches for exchanging and sharing BlMs are presented. The third
   section elaborates on IS Integration, AJAX and Web Services. Finally,
   three design patterns that have been developed are presented and
   discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the process of creating and
   managing parametric digital models of a building (or a piece of
   infrastructure) during the building's life cycle and across business
   functions. For developing Critical Success Factors (CSF) for assessment
   of BIM technology adoption at an organizational level, this second part
   of the paper focuses on factor analysis, causal relationship analysis,
   and reliability tests analysis. The first part of the paper has proposed
   a five-step empirical approach to derive CSFs and has identified 80 key
   factors (KF) that are significant attributes for BIM adoption, which are
   subjected to further analysis in this second part. The results find 58
   CSFs that are manageable and critical for BIM adoption within
   architecture, engineering, and construction organizations, which insure
   BIM-based business objectives if they are partially or fully
   accomplished satisfactorily. The applicability of the CSFs for BIM
   adoption is illustrated using a hypothesized framework for BIM adoption
   assessment. The framework consists of eight BIM performance criteria and
   two outcomes modeled as a BIM business value chain. Although only a
   small amount of survey data have been collected (but of good quality),
   the proposed approach is shown to be able to handle this small
   collection of data and derive useful CSFs for the current practices of
   BIM adoption in Taiwan, where BIM adoption is still at an early stage.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a growing reality in
   the civil industry. Merging 3D geometric information with engineering
   data, the BIM model combines geometry, spatial relationships, and other
   properties used at all stages of the building's life cycle. With the
   need to apply such methodology to existing buildings, researchers have
   focused on how to automatically generate or update such models from 3D
   point clouds provided by laser scanning sensors or photogrammetry
   methods. Most of this research has focused on the recognition of either
   planar (e.g., floor, walls) or cylindrical (e.g., piping) structures.
   Few works have dealt with the detection of steel structural elements,
   due to its particular shape, and only recently focused on detecting
   their geometric specifications. However, in these approaches, the point
   cloud of each structural element was manually separated from the point
   cloud of the entire building. This situation creates a challenge since
   the manual segmentation of a point cloud is a long and subjective
   process. In addition to geometric information, recent research has
   focused on automatically detecting anomalies in structures. Such
   information, incorporated into the BIM model, allows the structural
   element to be evaluated using structural analysis applications. The
   availability of the results of this analysis to BIM professionals is
   essential for the correct planning of possible interventions.
   Unfortunately, open-source BIM model visualization tools restrict their
   functionalities to design review and construction analysis. In this
   work, we propose an extension of a previous automated method to detect
   steel elements to identify and measure deformations and a visualization
   tool that shows the quality of an existing building's structural
   elements directly in the 3D point cloud. With the results of deformation
   detection, we compute the quality level of structural elements and
   present it directly in the 3D view of the building, preserving its
   spatial context, with the use of colors and annotations.},

Abstract = {The enormous variety of design systems and data formats utilised by the
   actors in the building design process has been recognised as a
   significant challenge for information exchange and project management.
   The introduction of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data standard
   as a paradigm shift has opened a first time opportunity for smooth data
   and information exchange over the full range of design related
   parameters and processes, reaching beyond the classical constructional,
   economic and safetyrelated requirements. Moreover, IFC allows for the
   extension of the standard in further areas, corresponding to the
   specific design, project or client requirements. These user-driven
   extensions often close an important gap of the IFC standard and can
   subsequently be imbedded in new releases of the IFC data standard. This
   paper is focused on the extension of IFC for the purposes of controlling
   and managing material use, increasing material efficiency and closing
   material cycles over the life cycle of a building. Material efficiency
   is defined by the design scopes of material recyclability, element
   reusability and waste reduction. The practical implications of the data
   format extension and design-check performance are examined on the level
   of the data model and, subsequently, on the level of proprietary
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, based on a pre-defined
   case.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has recently emerged as a novel
   technology worldwide however literature review reveals a salient gap in
   the identification of BIM capabilities in Key Performance Indicators
   (KPI) of construction projects in Iran. Therefore, the aim of this
   research is to identify and prioritize the BIM applications toward KPIs
   in light of the construction stage of projects life cycle in Iran. To do
   this, a review of literature was performed on the KPIs and associated
   BIM contributions and the resultants were customized for Iranian context
   through a two-round Delphi study. An advanced Fuzzy-AHP approach was
   then applied in the prioritizations of KPIs and associated BIM
   capabilities via collecting data from construction practitioners. It was
   identified that quality improvement, sustainable construction and
   construction cost reduction are the top three KPIs that can be
   benefitted from BIM applications in the construction stage of building
   projects. It was also concluded that project coordination, clash
   detection, 4D and 5D BIM are the subsequent beneficial effects of BIM on
   the construction project KPIs in Iran. This study is a point of
   departure for BIM-based research and its managerial perspectives
   outlining an insight toward the application of BIM in the construction
   projects of Iran.},

Title = {Barriers to BIM Implementation in Architecture, Construction, and
   Engineering Projects-The Polish Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {BIM (building information modeling) is a kind of technology that has
   great potential to enhance the level of automation in architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. The created virtual model
   of the facility allows coordinating all industries during the entire
   life cycle of the building. The possibility to save the data related to
   the given facility in one place, namely in the BIM model, enables
   control and management of the AEC projects at every stage. During the
   design and implementation phase, BIM models facilitate the optimization
   of time, costs, and quality, and in the operational phase, they support
   effective management of the facility. The use of BIM for building energy
   modeling (BEM) is the next step of evolution in architecture and
   engineering design practice. The benefits of using the BIM approach are
   widely discussed in the literature; however, they may be hard to achieve
   if appropriate attention is not directed to minimizing the barriers to
   the implementation of this technology. Observing Europe, one can notice
   that western and northern countries successfully use BIM for their
   needs, while the countries of the Eastern Bloc, including Poland,
   introduce it at a slower pace. In the present paper, the authors
   conducted a cause-and-effect analysis of the identified barriers to the
   implementation of BIM technology in the construction process. For this
   purpose, the authors applied the Ishikawa diagram, which is a tool that
   helps to recognize the actual or potential causes of failure. The
   analysis conducted showed that one of the weakest links in the
   successful BIM implementation is people and, in particular, their lack
   of knowledge and reluctance to change. The authors indicated the need to
   introduce and strengthen preventive actions, mainly through education:
   training, courses, and studies focused on BIM technology.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Facility management (FM) is the most extended phase of the entire life
   cycle of buildings and incurs the highest expenses. However, limited
   quality drawings and historical data make information flow more
   complicated for many existing buildings and lead to inefficient FM. This
   research proposes a systematic and comprehensive reality point cloud
   model-based framework to support the FM process with feasible visual
   data collection. Specifically, this framework covers an end-to-end
   workflow of using a reality model to implement FM strategies, including
   visual data capture process for generating a reality model; FM
   information attachment in a reality model for issue queries; and
   information flow for issue tracking. The resulting reality model
   captures with critical and necessary FM data input can be used as an
   asset information model (AIM). We have also defined stakeholders'
   responsibilities in implementing FM and how the data are transferred,
   updated, and used within a reality point cloud-based AIM by
   stakeholders. The framework is evaluated by interviewing FM experts, and
   the results demonstrate that implementing the framework could improve
   the FM process's efficiency by using reality models.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Materials are continuously accumulating in the human-built environment
   since massive amounts of materials are required for building,
   developing, and maintaining cities. At the end of their life cycles,
   these materials are considered valuable sources of secondary materials.
   The increasing construction and demolition waste released from aging
   stock each year make up the heaviest, most voluminous waste outflow,
   presenting challenges and opportunities. These material stocks should be
   utilized and exploited since the reuse and recycling of construction
   materials would positively impact the natural environment and resource
   efficiency, leading to sustainable cities within a grander scheme of a
   circular economy. The exploitation of material stock is known as urban
   mining. In order to make these materials accessible for future mining,
   material quantities need to be estimated and extrapolated to regional
   levels. This demanding task requires a vast knowledge of the existing
   building stock, which can only be obtained through labor-intensive,
   time-consuming methodologies or new technologies, such as building
   information modeling (BIM), geographic information systems (GISs),
   artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. This review paper

Abstract = {Technologies for the acquisition, storage and mining of big data are
   increasingly affecting the Architecture, Engineering and Construction
   (AEC) industry, modifying the way buildings are conceived and developed.
   Indeed, they will be no longer designed and managed only as financial
   products, but also as service providers to support the needs of the
   occupants. This is a great challenge in the building sector, that is
   experiencing a period of various (r)evolution concerning products,
   technologies and processes.
   This research defines a digitally enabled framework for operating
   cognitive buildings, presenting a case study by which it has been
   possible to analyze how information collected during operations could
   inform end-users (i.e. administrators, owners, facility managers and
   occupants) about the behavior of both buildings and occupants. Focusing
   on building in-use stages, advantages in tracking the behavior of
   occupants and in satisfying the needs of users should be derived through
   the availability of real-time information, i.e. collected by sensors. In
   this way, not only the behavior of users could be taken into account,
   but also predicted performance could be correlated with real measurement
   and, consequently, the building performance gap should be estimated and
   filled. A connection between as-designed virtual models (resulted from a
   BIM - Building Information Modeling - process) and as-delivered physical
   assets (monitored in real-time, i.e. through BMS - Building Management
   Systems) could be established to explore how BIM practices and
   technologies could improve a data-driven asset management, by enriching
   building information in operation.
   The results should allow pointing out how data and information gathered
   along building life cycle could provide services to users.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the characteristics of the environmental impacts of
   apartment buildings, a typical housing type in South Korea, as part of a
   research project supporting the streamlined life cycle assessment
   (S-LCA) of buildings within the G-SEED (Green Standard for Energy and
   Environmental Design) framework. Three recently built apartment building
   complexes were chosen as study objects for the quantitative evaluation
   of the buildings in terms of their embodied environmental impacts
   (global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication
   potential, ozone layer depletion potential, photochemical oxidant
   creation potential, and abiotic depletion potential), using the LCA
   approach. Additionally, we analyzed the emission trends according to the
   cut-off criteria of the six environmental impact categories by
   performing an S-LCA with cut-off criteria 90-99\% of the cumulative
   weight percentile. Consequently, we were able to present the cut-off
   criterion best suited for S-LCA and analyze the effect of the cut-off
   criteria on the environmental impact analysis results. A comprehensive
   environmental impact analysis of the characteristics of the six
   environmental impact categories revealed that the error rate was below
   5\% when the cut-off criterion of 97.5\% of the cumulative weight
   percentile was applied, thus verifying its validity as the optimal
   cut-off criterion for S-LCA.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop a methodology for the selection of
   sustainable building materials for the reduction of embodied and
   operational energy for a complex infrastructure transportation project,
   i.e., elevated metro rail station of Ahmedabad, India by application of
   building information modelling (BIM) and factor comparison method (FCM).
   Evaluation of the alternative building materials and designs to obtain
   the best energy efficiency has been carried out using Revit Architecture
   2018 and Green Building Studio. The achieved average embodied energy
   savings is about 73\%, which is by the suggested alternative materials
   instead of existing ones. By application of FCM, which is a
   multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique, it has been observed
   that the polished Kota-stone flooring, stone-floor-tile cladding,
   toughened fibre-glass ceiling and insulated fibre-glass door appear to
   be the most feasible sustainable material for flooring, wall cladding,
   ceiling, openings and fenestrations for the design of the metro rail
   station box in Ahmedabad, India. This study contributes significant
   knowledge in the field by highlighting the application of BIM as a tool
   for sustainable development and recommends a few alternate building
   materials and sustainable designs which would result in the reduction of
   energy usage for the metro-rail-station and other building structures

Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose- Implementing building information modeling (BIM) in
   construction projects offers many benefits. However, the use of BIM in
   project cost management is still limited. This study aims to review the
   current trends in the application of BIM in project cost
   management.Design/methodology/approach- This study systematically
   reviews the literature on the application of BIM in project cost
   management. A total of 46 related articles were identified and analyzed
   using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses method.Findings- Eighteen approaches to applying BIM in
   project cost management were identified. The approaches can be grouped
   into cost control and cost estimation. Also, BIM can be applied
   independently or integrated with other techniques. The integrated
   approaches for cost control include integration with genetic algorithms,
   Monte Carlo simulation, lean construction, integrated project delivery,
   neural network and value engineering. On the contrary, integrated
   approaches for cost estimation include integration with cost-plus
   pricing, discrepancy analysis, construction progress curves, estimation
   standards, algorithms, declarative mappings, life cycle sustainability
   assessment, ontology, Web-based frameworks and structured query
   language.Originality/value- To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
   study is the first to systematically review prior literature on the
   application of BIM in project cost management. As a result, the study
   provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art
   and fills the literature gap. Researchers and industry professionals can
   use the study findings to increase the benefits of implementing BIM in
   construction projects.},

Title = {Integration of Lessons Learned Knowledge in Building Information
   Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {144},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lessons learned systems are vital means for integrating construction
   knowledge into the various phases of the construction project life
   cycle. Many such systems are tailored toward the owner-organization's
   specific needs and workflows to overcome challenges with information
   collection, documentation, and retrieval. Previous works have relied on
   the development of conventional local and network/cloud-based database
   management systems to store and retrieve lessons gathered on projects.
   These lessons learned systems operate independently and have not been
   developed to take full advantage of the benefits of integration with
   emerging building information modeling (BIM) technology. As such,
   construction professionals are faced with a lack of efficient and speedy
   retrieval of context-focused information on lessons learned for
   appropriate utilization in projects. To tackle this challenge, we
   propose the integration of lessons learned knowledge management in BIM
   in addition to existing two-dimensional to eight-dimensional modeling of
   project information. The integration was implemented through the
   embedding of nonstructured query system, NoSQL (MongoDB), in a
   BIM-enabled environment to host lessons learned information linked to
   model items and four-dimensional modeling project tasks of the digitized
   model. This is beyond existing conventional text-based queries and is
   novel. The system is implemented in .NET Frameworks and interfaced with
   a project management BIM tool, Navisworks Manage. The demonstration with
   a test case of a federated model from a predesign school project
   suggests that lessons learned systems can become an integral part of BIM
   environments and contribute to enhancing knowledge reuse in projects.},

Title = {Leveraging BIM and Big Data to deliver well maintained highways},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {13-14, SI},
Pages = {818-832},
Abstract = {Purpose - Effective management of highways requires management of
   diverse data sets including traffic volume data, roadway, and road edge
   and road-side data. Like all major infrastructure clients, highways
   administration authorities are under pressure to use such platforms for
   better management of data that, in addition to creating other
   opportunities, allows improved life cycle management of asset data and
   predictive analytics. This paper aims to review such opportunities and
   the value that can be generated through integrated life cycle data
   management by leveraging Big Data and building information modelling
   (BIM).
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is initially performed
   to systematically gather information to identify and understand BIM as a
   collaborative platform. Data management applications in other industries
   are also reviewed. Interviews were conducted and two industry workshops
   were organised to understand BIM implementation challenges within
   highways development projects and the role BIM can play in bridging
   inefficiencies resulting from loss of information at handover phases.
   The overall understanding lead to drawing up user needs, gathering
   system requirements and eventually a system architecture design to
   promote efficient information management throughout the asset lifecycle.
   Findings - It is observed that data from the design and construction
   phases of projects can be used to inform asset registers from an earlier
   stage. This information can be used to plan maintenance schedules.
   Moreover, it can also be integrated with data generated from numerous
   other sensors to develop a better picture of network operations and
   support key decision-making. Effective road network management involves
   collection and analysis of huge data from a variety of sources including
   sensors, mobiles, assets and Open Data. Recent growth in Big Data
   analytics and data integration technologies provides new opportunities
   to optimise operations of highways infrastructure.
   Research limitations/implications - The system architecture designed for
   this research is translated into a prototype system as a proof of
   concept. However, it needs to be tested and validated by end users to be
   transformed into a useful solution for the industry.
   Originality/value - This paper provides an enhanced understanding of new
   opportunities created to optimise operations of highways infrastructure
   using the recent growth in Big Data analytics and data integration
   technologies.},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of noise and vibration are becoming
   increasingly important in the assessment of new and upgraded railway
   routes. Vibration from railways propagates through the ground to nearby
   buildings where it may cause annoyance as feelable vibration or as
   re-radiated noise. To tackle the adverse effects of ground-borne noise a
   range of possible interventions are available, including softer rail
   pads, under-sleeper pads and under-ballast mats. The installation costs
   of such interventions are generally higher for the higher-performing
   track types. Additionally, there are potential effects on track
   maintenance costs which may be positive or negative, for example by
   reducing sleeper damage or increasing the need for ballast tamping. This
   study presents a socio-economic analysis of the effects of several
   interventions to reduce ground-borne noise. By selecting a whole route,
   the installation and whole-life costs are assessed using Network Rail's
   Vehicle-Track Interaction Strategic Model (VTISM) and these are offset
   against benefits in terms of reduced social costs. Ground-borne noise is
   predicted at various distances from the alignment using the Modelling of
   Train Induced Vibration (MOTIV) model and the effect of track
   interventions is determined as insertion loss spectra. The re-radiated
   noise within a typical domestic building is then estimated using generic
   building transfer functions. Geographic Information System tools are
   used to estimate the population affected by ground-borne noise and their
   expected level of exposure. The methodology is illustrated using a case
   study route between Brighton and Portsmouth in the South of England.},

Abstract = {Among the technological advancements of Industry 4.0, virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) have been used in
   many industries to visualize and interact with digital twins in
   real-time. These technologies have also been used with building
   information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS)
   throughout the life cycle of construction projects. Moreover, the
   integration of BIM and GIS has been proven to improve collaboration
   among stakeholders by allowing them to visualize information seamlessly
   between buildings and their surroundings. Following the COVID-19
   pandemic, many undergraduate and graduate courses were moved online,
   which posed many challenges on instructors to deliver lectures in
   accessible and informative ways. Furthermore, many courses and curricula
   have been originally online and have not yet benefited from the full
   potential of MR in virtual classrooms. Therefore, the aim of this
   research is to evaluate how MR applications of integrated BIM-GIS can
   improve the online learning experience of construction management
   students. An experimental study was conducted with students to evaluate
   the effect of using AR on handheld devices and MR on head-mounted
   devices on their spatio-temporal reasoning and understanding skills.},

Title = {BIM-based environmental assessment of residential renovation projects

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to combat
   global climate change has become an international necessity. A large
   portion of energy consumption is attributed to old buildings, with
   increased operational costs and decreased occupational comfort. These
   buildings require renovation measures that can be viewed as an
   opportunity to implement sustainable construction and create
   traditionally designed buildings based on sustainable construction. This
   study proposes a combination of building information modeling (BIM) with
   Design Builder and Meteonorm software to evaluate the environmental
   impact of renovating buildings during the operational phase. The process
   involved is demonstrated in a case study application to a typical
   two-story single-family residential building in Tehran city, in which
   the building's materials, weight, and volume are determined using Revit
   software, and Design Builder is used to simulate the renovation effect
   on various building components - showing that, by combining the most
   effective insulation, glass, heating system, and doors, a 15\% reduction
   in energy consumption and 44\% reduction in CO2 emissions could be
   achieved. The study significantly advances knowledge in sustainable
   building practices by introducing a practical framework for
   decision-making in environmentally conscious building renovations,
   focusing on such crucial elements as insulation materials, window glass
   types, heating systems, and door materials. It also provides valuable
   insights into the practical implications of weather data for accurate
   environmental forecasting, emphasizing the methodology's applicability
   and adaptability to similar contexts, as evidenced by its successful
   application in a real-world case in Tehran.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to further the discussion on Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) legal requirements, providing a framework
   with key energy parameters capable of supporting the Appointing Party in
   the definition of the Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) for a BIM
   project appointment. The EIR is described in ISO-19650-1:2018 as a
   fundamental step in the information delivery cycle.
   Design/methodology/approach A literature review on the topic of BIM
   energy analysis was completed to identify current knowledge gaps and
   support the need for the proposed framework. Afterwards, the framework
   was established based on the review findings and the authors' domain
   knowledge. The applicability of the proposed framework was assessed
   through a case study, where several energy simulations were performed in
   three different design stages of the same BIM model. Findings This study
   identified a lack of standards and legislation capable of supporting the
   Appointing Party in the definition of energy-related BIM requirements.
   To this end, a new framework is proposed to mediate existing practices,
   linking prior knowledge with BIM's new reality. The study showcases the
   applicability of the framework, identifying that the performance of
   different energy studies involves distinct Level of Development (LOD)
   requirements, which in turn have an impact on the modelling time and
   cost. Originality/value A BIM framework for the specification of
   information requirements in energy-related projects was developed to
   support the Appointing Party. The framework presents appropriate
   parameters for energy analysis in each design stage, as well as the
   suitable LOD for the BIM model.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been acting an
   important role in the delivery of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC)
   project. However, the full potential of BIM to MiC project cannot be
   realized without accurate information collection, timely information
   exchange, and automatic decision support throughout the project life
   cycle. In order to fulfil such requirements, this paper aims to develop
   an Internet of Things-enabled BIM platform (IBIMP) for the MiC project.
   A real-life project located in Hong Kong were deeply explored for
   developing the platform. The IBIMP consists of smart construction
   objects (SCOs) equipped with smart trinity tag (STT) and GPS sensor,
   smart gateway system, data source management service, location-based
   service, rule-based progress control service, as well as decision
   support services for prefabrication production, transportation, and
   on-site assembly processes. With the combination of advanced Internet of
   Things (IoT) technology and BIM technology, the barriers that hamper the
   possible functions of BIM can be overcame. By using application
   scenarios of a subsided sale flats MiC project in Hong Kong as examples,
   this study demonstrates how problems encountered by independent
   stakeholders such as inconvenient data collection, lack of automatic
   decision support, and incomplete information can be addressed by the
   IBIMP.},

Abstract = {This study is devoted to the development of an information system for
   creating digital twins of construction sites by integrating Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) technologies and artificial intelligence
   systems. An artificial intelligence system has been developed that
   combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named ``You Only Look
   Once{''} v3 (YOLOv3) and Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)
   architectures as a comprehensive mechanism for detecting, classifying,
   and evaluating individual components, objects, systems and processes of
   the construction project at all stages of its life cycle. The article
   describes the inclusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
   Technologies for recognizing the physical representation of the
   large-scale array of construction objects used on a construction site in
   real-time. The effectiveness of identifying the correspondence of a set
   of BIM-model attributes that provide the circumstances for creating a
   digital twin of the construction site is determined. The reliability of
   object recognition by the YOLOv3 model is proved, which is confirmed by
   the map indicator - 90.04\%, which additionally correlates the FFNN
   model with attributes of the reference BIM model. The results of this
   study can be used to further improve the concept of developing digital
   twins using other relevant and key components of the construction
   project and the latest information technologies.},

Abstract = {Accurately and rationally quantifying the environmental impact of
   construction and demolition waste (CDW) management is paramount,
   especially the environmental impact of different waste disposals, and
   more effective policies should be implemented to manage CDW. However,
   previous research on CDW disposal has typically ignored the potential
   for energy recovery and focused on a single environmental impact
   category. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework
   to assess the environmental impacts under different CDW management
   scenarios (including reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and landfill),
   quantifying the global warming potential and resource consumption
   impacts under different scenarios. This framework incorporates Building
   Information Modeling to accurately collect data for feedback to the Life
   Cycle Assessment. The results indicate that Scenario 3, which considers
   the circular economy strategy, efficiently reuses metals, plastics,
   glass, and wood, generates recycled aggregate from concrete and cement,
   recycles bricks and tiles, and uses the remaining waste for energy
   recovery. This CDW management scenario, which prioritizes reuse and
   recycling, is the most effective in mitigating carbon emissions,
   resulting in a reduction of 6.641 x 105 kg CO2 eq. Moreover, it
   significantly conserves resources and prevents the energy consumption of
   4.601 x 107 MJ. Among them, metal reuse saves 42.35\% of resources, and
   plastic reuse saves 31.19\% of resources. In addition, increasing the
   reuse rate and recovery rate can directly avoid carbon emissions and
   cumulative exergy consumption, effectively alleviating environmental
   issues. This study can provide new ideas for the treatment of CDW, which
   can provide a basis for the relevant government departments to formulate
   CDW management policies.},

Title = {BIM-Based Digital Twin and XR Devices to Improve Maintenance Procedures
   in Smart Buildings: A Literature Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {In recent years, the use of digital twins (DT) to improve maintenance
   procedures has increased in various industrial sectors (e.g.,
   manufacturing, energy industry, aerospace) but is more limited in the
   construction industry. However, the operation and maintenance (O\&M)
   phase of a building's life cycle is the most expensive. Smart buildings
   already use BIM (Building Information Modeling) for facility management,
   but they lack the predictive capabilities of DT. On the other hand, the
   use of extended reality (XR) technologies to improve maintenance
   operations has been a major topic of academic research in recent years,
   both through data display and remote collaboration. In this context,
   this paper focuses on reviewing projects using a combination of these
   technologies to improve maintenance operations in smart buildings. This
   review uses a combination of at least three of the terms ``Digital
   Twin{''}, ``Maintenance{''}, ``BIM{''} and ``Extended Reality{''}.
   Results show how a BIM can be used to create a DT and how this DT use
   combined with XR technologies can improve maintenance operations in a
   smart building. This paper also highlights the challenges for the
   correct implementation of a BIM-based DT combined with XR devices. An
   example of use is also proposed using a diagram of the possible
   interactions between the user, the DT and the application framework
   during maintenance operations.},

Abstract = {Computer aid in Facility Management (FM) has been in use for about 40
   years and has led to the so-called Computer Aided Facility Management
   (CAFM). CAFM offers various interfaces to exchange information between
   different kinds of tools. Various inter-trade organisations and
   associations have already developed information-exchange procedures.
   Besides the CAFM-developer, these organisations have defined
   information-exchange standards to integrate the Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) approach into FM, e.g. 3D visualization and underlying
   information concerning buildings and its devices. At this juncture
   (March 2017) the combination of BIM and FM is not only possible, it is
   mandatory. It is merely possible to exchange already existing
   information concerning the buildings. This implicates the acquisition
   and also adding the exchange of these information through to the chosen
   CAFM and BIM software tools. According to the fact that already existing
   information can only be used for the information exchange (and are later
   usable in FM), it is not possible to represent information which are
   related close to real-time. ``Operating instead of reacting{''} is often
   used as a maxim in industry which leads to the integration of BIM and
   FM. The need of linking real-time data in FM is based on the requirement
   in the fields of energy management, central building control and safety
   systems. Via static and mobile sensors, information is collected and
   sent to CAFM-connectors. Within these connectors, information concerning
   BIM-linked building parts are transferred to an external database, which
   offers information management by the building participants, such as the
   architect, experts, project manager, building coordinator, investor and
   structural engineer. While using real-time data systems, lifecycle costs
   will decline while the whole life period of the building will increase,
   and safety for users will improve.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the NetFlinCS framework, which allows a fast
   and effective development of computeintensive interactive applications
   for mobile devices using hybrid cloud technologies. In addition, we show
   its advantages by using the proposed technology to build a context-based
   detection and surveillance application for construction sites, which
   aggregates all relevant data during architecture planning and the
   construction process for documentation and later use in facility
   management. The NetFlinCS framework enables rich Mixed Reality
   techniques like sensor fusion over multiple mobile devices or AI-based
   recognition as well as the integration of databases to enable an
   automatic detection of discrepancies based on common tracking
   technologies. The device uses the location awareness to process the
   camera stream in the context of the local planning data. To reduce the
   client's workload as well as for better scalability and to enable the
   heavy use of machine learning techniques, we use a hybrid cloud
   environment that consists of all available servers and clients to
   outsource expensive calculations. The hybrid cloud backend provides
   different services like machine learning based segmentation, inpainting,
   and scene classification that support navigation, video processing, and
   error estimation in real-time. By deeply integrating standard data
   formats like the Industry Foundation Classes standard and Building
   Information Modeling it is possible to compare these databases with
   tracking data to detect and localize discrepancies over the whole life
   cycle of a building, from planning data (blueprints, architectural
   models, etc.) up to the real building.},

Title = {Developing a Framework for Dynamic Organizational Resilience Analysis in
   Prefabricated Construction Projects: A Project Life Cycle Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated construction has recently played an increasingly
   significant role in social, environmental, and economic developments in
   the construction sector. Because prefabricated construction projects
   (PCPs) are interorganizational in nature, their successful delivery,
   especially under uncertain circumstances, relies on organizational
   resilience performance throughout the life cycle. The purpose of this
   study is to develop an ethnography-based methodological framework for
   the PCPs to evaluate, analyze, and improve the dynamic organizational
   resilience regarding efficiency, flexibility, and robustness from a life
   cycle perspective. A two-part framework is developed. The qualitative
   first part identifies the roles and relationships of participating
   stakeholders during each project phase, and the second quantitative part
   measures and analyzes the PCP's organizational resilience. A typical
   engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract PCP in China
   is used as a case analysis to assess the validity of this developed
   framework. The results show that the robustness and flexibility of the
   PCP should be improved. Such improvement can be achieved by managing and
   enhancing the workflow control and how stakeholders communicate. This
   scenario was examined via a comparative analysis of employing building
   information model (BIM) and decentralized collaboration platform (DCP)
   within the case project. Finally, this developed framework could be used
   as a practical decision-making tool for managers to improve the
   organizational resilience in the aspects of efficiency, flexibility, and
   robustness of PCPs in case unforeseen events are encountered. It
   contributes to the current knowledge body of PCPs by incorporating
   organizational resilience theory into its performance evaluation and
   improvements.},

Title = {A building information modeling-based carbon emission measurement system
   for prefabricated residential buildings during the materialization phase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {264},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {This study develops a carbon emission measurement system for
   prefabricated residential buildings (PRBs) during the materialization
   phase based on building information modeling (BIM) and a carbon emission
   measurement model. The model is constructed using the carbon emission
   coefficient method. For more accurate measurement, the materialization
   phase of PRBs' carbon cycle is re-defined into five stages (material
   production, material transportation, component production, component
   transportation, and construction). This innovative system also
   incorporates Microsoft Access-based databases for data management. The
   implementation of the system in a PRB project in Shenzhen, China
   revealed that over 90\% of carbon emissions were generated in the
   building material production and construction stages, and overall carbon
   emissions per unit volume of all the prefabricated components were
   764.87 kg/m(3), 20.11\% lower than those of the cast-in-situ parts.
   Compared with results obtained from the traditional method, the system's
   percentage error was 6.52\%, showing good reliability in carbon emission
   measurement. The discrepancy was reasonably justified by inevitable
   material losses and transportation distances. It is concluded that the
   measurement system can accurately predict PRB projects' carbon emissions
   in project planning and early design, identify key areas for carbon
   emission pre-control, and facilitate dynamic management of carbon
   emission reduction during the materialization phase. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Adding value through enterprise building information models in
   health-care services},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 8},
Abstract = {PurposeThe main aim of this paper is to describe the potential benefits
   of enterprise building information models (EBIMs) for health-care
   institutions. The main research question addressed is how data from EBIM
   could be leveraged to create value for hospitals beyond design,
   construction and traditional facility management.
   Design/methodology/approachThree different prototypes, which use
   different technologies in combination with EBIM, are described to
   illustrate different uses of EBIM within the context of a hospital and
   health-care operations. The case study approach has been used to present
   the prototypes. FindingsEBIM data, in combination with other data
   sources, increases the potential benefits of the data with respect to
   many health-care-related processes, during the operation of a
   health-care institution. The benefits of EBIM span beyond the design and
   construction life cycle phases of a hospital and provide value to a
   variety of stakeholders in multiple health-care-related processes.
   Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this work is the
   limited sources of data and information such as the specific methods
   that were used in the design and development of each of the prototypes
   and a deeper insight into the design rationale and decisions. Another
   limitation of this paper is that the findings have not been validated.
   Practical implicationsThis study demonstrates the value of convergence
   of a number of technologies such as EBIM, data and different types of
   technologies, throughout the life cycle of a building. This study also
   highlights the value of building information models (BIMs) data for
   supporting the design of novel educational and other types of
   application areas. The practical implications include the value for
   multiple stakeholders, such as resources planning, fleet and equipment
   management and contract negotiation. Benefits identified for resource
   planning can have strategic and financial implications at the management
   level. For patients, visitors and health-care personnel, there may be
   reduced infections, cleaner and pleasant facilities as well as a
   reduction of time to find relevant resources. Social implicationsSocial
   implications{''} could be replaced by ``For patients, visitors and
   health-care personnel, there may be cleaner and pleasant facilities and
   easy navigation support through the hospital. Furthermore, enhanced
   access to knowledge and information about the artefact and assets in the
   hospital can enhance learning and knowledge sharing.
   Originality/valueThis study identifies the lack of research in using BIM
   with other data for value-added services for multiple stakeholders in
   the operations phase of a hospital and addresses that research gap.},

Abstract = {Construction industry projects play a significant role in the
   sustainable economic growth of all other industries. To achieve a
   sustainable economy, the future associated costs act as a barrier that
   must be addressed in the initial stages of a construction project. To
   evaluate the future costs, Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is found to
   be an effective technique that determines the present worth of future
   costs. This study focuses on reviewing the conducted research in the
   field of optimising cost during the project life cycle via LCCA to
   sustain economic sustainability and associating the environmental and
   social cost factors to enhance sustainability. A systematic literature
   review strategy is developed to extract relevant literature from Scopus,
   Web of Science, Science Direct, Emerald and American Society of Civil
   Engineering from the year 2009 to 2020. Adopting the PRISMA statement, a
   total of 83 articles are reviewed systematically in detail. Many
   construction sections are explored with the impact of LCCA on them. The
   LCCA impact the performance of construction projects during certain
   practices such as structural designing, energy cost optimisation,
   building envelope efficiency in energy demand and utilisation
   optimisation and earthquake engineering. Moreover, this study highlights
   the influence of LCCA in optimising the environmental impact of a new or
   existing construction project to avail economic sustainability along
   with the social and environmental. A conceptual framework has been
   proposed that shows the influence of LCCA on the construction industry,
   which directly impacts economic sustainability and indirectly
   environmental sustainability.},

Title = {BIM Policy Trends in Europe: Insights from a Multi-Stage Analysis},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study offers a detailed analysis of building information modelling
   (BIM) policy and implementation across Europe, significantly
   contributing to the sector's digital transformation. By collating data
   from governmental, academic, and industry sources, it identifies key
   trends and evaluates the effectiveness of BIM policies in advancing
   technology within construction. A systematic literature review and text
   mining across major databases revealed an increasing focus on
   sustainability, particularly ``life cycle assessment{''} and ``energy
   efficiency{''}, aligning with the Industry 5.0 initiative. The research
   shows that 35\% of European countries have or plan to introduce BIM
   mandates, highlighting BIM's crucial role in enhancing construction
   practices and influencing policy frameworks. Insights from this study
   are valuable for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, guiding
   the adoption and operationalization of BIM and emphasizing the need for
   thorough market preparation, including funding, training, and
   standardization. Additionally, the study suggests a correlation between
   a country's economic development and its propensity to enforce BIM
   mandates. Future research could explore regional policy variations and
   delve into the theoretical aspects of policy adoption and innovation
   diffusion to further understand BIM uptake dynamics.},

Title = {Sustainable Infrastructure Design Framework through Integration of
   Rating Systems and Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {BIM (building information modeling) can be the basis for carrying out
   various performance analyses. Sustainable infrastructure rating systems
   are suitable tools for assessing an infrastructure's environmental
   performance. It is necessary to integrate them in the design process.
   The research adopted a thorough literature review to follow the
   development trends, interviews with professionals from the academia and
   industry, and a critical analysis of technical requirements for
   integrating BIM tools and infrastructure sustainability rating systems
   in the design process. This study propagates a conceptual framework for
   integrating sustainability rating systems by introducing BIM with a
   sustainability metric plug-in. The adoption of the proposed solution
   allows for what-if scenarios to better support the incorporation of
   sustainability into design decisions and the assessment of
   sustainability at the design phase of the infrastructure project. The
   framework is used to refine designs and ensure that sustainable goals
   are met and to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. This
   paper concludes that greater emphasis should be placed on supporting
   technical requirements to facilitate the integration of BIM and
   sustainability rating systems. It defines the possibility of BIM
   adoption to influence the sustainable project performance in the
   infrastructure. `this framework could streamline the sustainable design
   process and lead to more integrated infrastructure delivery.},

Title = {Key factors for the BIM adoption by architects: a China study},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {732-748},
Abstract = {Purpose - There has been a growing attention to building information
   modeling (BIM) globally due to its benefits to various stages of a
   building's life cycle. To facilitate the implementation of BIM in the
   construction industry effectively, the purpose of this paper is to gain
   a better understanding of the mechanism for BIM adoption by
   practitioners such as architects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey of architects is
   conducted in Shenzhen, China. A structural equation model is built with
   survey data to identify the key factors affecting architects' BIM
   adoption in the design firms.
   Findings - It is found that motivation, technical defects of BIM and BIM
   capability are the statistically significant factors affecting
   architects' BIM adoption whereas management support and knowledge
   structure are not.
   Research limitations/implications - Only one architectural, engineering
   and construction (AEC) profession, i.e. architects were selected as
   research participants. In future, other professions such as construction
   engineers, project managers, etc. should be investigated with respect to
   their BIM adoption issues.
   Practical implications - BIM technology developers should improve the
   technology along the objectives of economic benefits, effectiveness and
   efficiency of BIM adoption. The compatibility and integration between
   BIM and other widely available software in the industry should also be
   improved. Moreover, AEC company and project managers should provide
   architects with opportunities of BIM training so that architects are
   more likely to apply BIM in future projects.
   Originality/value - A quantitative theoretical model, i.e. structural
   equation model is built to identify key factors affecting architects'
   BIM adoption, which takes one step further to reveal the BIM adoption
   mechanism in contrast to previous descriptive-oriented studies.},

Abstract = {Building permits (BP) are authorizations required to start the
   construction of building projects and granted by public authorities. BPs
   are still mostly processed manually, which presents drawbacks (e.g.
   subjective interpretation of regulations, long processing times). The
   digitalization of the BP process is promising towards the digital
   transformation of public administration and the sector of Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC). However, current Digital Building
   Permit (DBP) solutions aiming to automate this process are usually
   partial, tailored-made or tool-specific, which hinders their
   applicability, extensibility, interoperability and portability. This
   paper presents an open and standards-based approach for the DBP in
   Montevideo, which comprises a compliance life cycle and a DBP platform.
   The approach leverages Building Information Modeling (BIM), is based on
   open standards and technologies, and aims to be extensible regarding
   regulations, types of buildings, and geographic locations. The approach
   also encompasses interdisciplinary work between teams with DBP-related
   skills (e.g. AEC, BIM, software engineering) and coming from different
   sectors (i.e. public administration, academia, software and AEC
   industries). The proposal was assessed by a prototype,
   functional/non-functional assessments, and validation activities with
   end-users. Results confirmed the feasibility and suitability of our
   approach, and let foresee its benefits and challenges.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shed light on integrating cutting-edge technologies
   in various organisations to support daily operations in the digital age.
   However, this implementation has resulted in undesirable consequences,
   notably contributing to global warming and climate change, primarily due
   to unchecked carbon emissions. Higher Educational Institutions are
   expected to lead by example in reducing global carbon emissions. Despite
   some institutions' efforts in this regard, multiple studies suggest that
   progress could be expedited through digital technology, leaving room for
   improvement. Numerous Higher Educational Institutions still need
   sustainable practices within their building infrastructure. Hence, this
   research project was developed to create an intelligent model for
   monitoring the carbon footprint of buildings within Higher Educational
   Institutions. The study focused on the Bandung Institute of Technology
   facilities, which encountered similar challenges stemming from various
   aspects contributing to the overall carbon footprint. This research
   effectively managed energy consumption by implementing design thinking,
   encompassing electricity and water usage, and reducing emissions.
   Furthermore, the application of this model provided valuable insights
   into both current and projected energy consumption and emission
   production. It also assessed the sustainability status of these
   buildings and enhanced the efficiency of information dissemination in
   energy reporting processes. This, in turn, facilitated the
   implementation of proactive measures for emission management not only at
   the Bandung Institute of Technology but also in other Higher Educational
   Institution buildings sharing similar characteristics.},

Abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) draws on a vital role in highly participatory
   and diversified working environment of construction projects. Knowledge
   keeps construction firms competitive and boosts performance high in
   future work. However, large and chaotic projects require KM achieved
   with technological support thorough the project life cycle. Building
   information modelling (BIM) has a wide range of interaction between
   researchers and practitioners as a new and promising area of
   technological research and implementation in construction. In the last
   decade, many researchers worked on the use of BIM in the construction
   industry. Collaborative interaction is one of the most important
   promises of BIM. Collaboration between construction professionals can be
   improved by firmly managed project knowledge. With BIM solutions, it can
   be easier to externalize, integrate, internalize and socialize
   knowledge. Operational knowledge and strategic knowledge can be managed
   through interactive BIM models. This study aims suggesting a conceptual
   model representing KM process through BIM. A comprehensive literature
   review on KM and BIM was established to construct the theoretical
   framework for the assignment of a conceptual model for BIM usage in KM
   process of construction projects. The proposed conceptual model is a
   road map for adapting KM process with BIM as a new KM tool. The ability
   of BIM to manage knowledge is determined. KM process is identified for
   construction projects. Existing process is reviewed and modified for the
   BIM usage. In future studies, empirical research will be conducted to
   strengthen the validation of the proposed model.},

Title = {Analysis of FM involvement during project Lifecycle phases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 9},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to analyze the facilities managers' involvement
   over the project life cycle phases (PLP), based on theoretical
   knowledge, consensus from empirical assessment of facilities managers
   and consultants' practices.Design/methodology/approachA literature
   review was undertaken to determine the different tasks that facilities
   managers typically handle, identify project phases and their underlying
   activities in which facilities managers would be involved. This was
   followed by targeting a group of consultants to build a consensus, upon
   the identified involvement of facilities managers, over the PLP, while
   measuring the level of involvement from a representative group of
   facilities managers in Saudi Arabia. A matching between the perceptions
   and practice has been performed to serve as recommendations for future
   research on improving the practice in Saudi Arabia.FindingsThe
   involvement of facilities managers in the PLP is relatively low,
   according to the consultants' perceptions. Consultants perceive that
   facilities managers should be involved in more professional activities,
   which would ultimately improve projects' delivery to clients.Practical
   implicationsThe involvement of facilities managers over the PLP ensures
   effective delivery of projects and reduces the multiplicity of
   challenges at the operation and maintenance phase. The viewing of
   facility managers' involvement adds to the effectiveness of their role
   within the building industry.Originality/valueThis paper investigates
   the consultants' perception of the involvement venues for facility
   managers to perform activities which are evaluated to be
   ``mandatory,{''} ``advantageous{''} or ``not necessary.{''} The study
   reflects the state of facilities management practice, and the consensus
   of consultants toward the role of the facility managers through the PLP.},

Title = {Using BIM to research carbon footprint during the materialization phase
   of prefabricated concrete buildings: A China study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The development of prefabricated concrete (PC) buildings can potentially
   reduce the consumption of resources and energy, and meet the
   requirements of low carbon and environmental protection in the
   construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to investigate PC
   buildings and their carbon footprint in the materialization phase. Based
   on databases from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   and the Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD), a database of carbon
   emission factors was compiled. A carbon footprint calculation model for
   the materialization phase of PC buildings was established combining with
   BIM technology. The obtained results indicate that the carbon footprint
   per unit area of PC construction projects is significantly lower than
   that of other building types. The carbon footprint of the production
   phase accounts for more than 90\% of the total, and the carbon footprint
   per unit area of the transportation phase and the construction and
   installation phase are equivalent. The carbon emission of a building
   material on its degree of influence is ranked as cement, steel, concrete
   and wire. In addition, the results can also provide a theoretical
   support for the formulation of regulations and emission reduction
   policies based on building energy conservation and carbon emission
   reduction. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Embodied carbon emissions of buildings: Taking a step towards net zero
   buildings},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As global concerns about climate change and environmental sustainability
   escalate, the construction industry is shifting significantly towards
   eco-resilient and sustainable building practices. This paper
   comprehensively explores integrating Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) with ecoresilient principles to create a framework for designing
   and constructing sustainable buildings. This research introduced a
   practical approach for evaluating the embodied carbon from building
   construction, drawing insights from a residential building in Yangon
   City, Myanmar. The method developed in this study aims to assess the
   carbon footprints associated with distinct stages of the construction
   process, including raw material production and material transportation.
   Additionally, the proposed method compares the material embodied carbon,
   transportation embodied carbon, and total cost in the residential
   building, considering two cases of traditional and lowcarbon materials.
   The results indicate that material embodied carbon contributes merely
   84\% to the overall, while material transportation makes up the
   remaining 16\% for both cases. Utilising low-carbon materials yields
   remarkable reductions, with a 40\% decrease in material embodied carbon
   and a 39\% decrease in transportation carbon footprint compared to
   conventional materials. However, adopting low-carbon materials incurs a
   modest increase of approximately 6.7\% in total cost. This study
   underscores the imperative of integrating low-carbon materials into the
   design of future passive buildings, advancing the pursuit of a net-zero
   strategy. This research underlines the potential for BIM-driven
   eco-resilient practices in mitigating carbon emissions and the need for
   continued innovation and collaboration in sustainable building design
   and construction.},

Abstract = {This paper concerns the reusable components and recycled materials from
   demounted structures which may draw a large amount of waste in
   construction industry. By a series of literature review and analyses, a
   material and component bank was proposed to manage more effectively the
   recycling of materials and direct reuse of components even of whole
   components obtained from old structures to facilitate a more sustainable
   construction industry. The concept, main businesses, and work operation
   of the bank were illustrated in detail including its potential
   management method and supply chain. The relationship between the bank
   and current building information modeling, design for deconstruction,
   supply chain, and life cycle assessment based on the bank were then
   analyzed in detail. It can be concluded that the bank could pave the way
   for effectively performing a further and repaid reuse of components and
   perfecting current recycling of materials to contribute a more
   sustainable built environment from the view of various terms mentioned
   in this study. The bank also can link with current method of life cycle
   assessment or environmental impact assessment well, which all can
   promote the construction sustainability indicating the bank can be
   integrated into current construction industry easily for the future.

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a technological innovation
   currently at the forefront of digital transformation in the built
   environment. To achieve satisfactory outcomes with BIM, adopters need to
   find the most appropriate implementation strategy that is economically
   efficient. The research discussed here explores why and how distribution
   of effort spent on various tasks over project life cycle can be used as
   a metric for assessing and improving the performance of BIM
   implementation. Using quantitative data collected from a single in-depth
   case study of a BIM-enabled design and build project and subsequent
   interviews with three project actors and 11 BIM experts, to validate and
   triangulate the findings, we explore the use of effort data to analyze
   and visualize effort distribution patterns. The visualizations revealed
   the dynamics of team collaboration and task interdependences in
   BIM-enabled work and their impact on effort distribution. Lack of timely
   input by the contractor, subcontractors and suppliers influenced unusual
   patterns in the distribution of efforts indicating potential sources of
   inefficiency and unnecessary costs in the BIM process; thereby revealing
   the pivotal role of procurement structure and suggesting the need for
   timely involvement of key project participants. The contribution of this
   work is twofold. Methodologically, effort distribution analytics can
   provide insights that managers can use to improve BIM implementation
   process. Theoretically, the findings can be used to support informed
   decision-making, control cost, optimize resources, manage cash flow and
   to structure fees.},

Title = {Application of intuitionistic fuzzy set in social life cycle impact
   assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 23},
Abstract = {PurposeIntuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) has been found promising for
   handling ambiguity forms of uncertainty in social data. This paper
   undertakes an application of an intuitionistic fuzzy set in the social
   life cycle impact assessment (S-LCIA) of a public building project. This
   work proposes to combine an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) with
   multi-attribute decision-making in converting qualitative data into
   quantitative social impacts of the building project. This research
   utilises IFS to accommodate and handle experts' imprecise cognitions in
   S-LCIA to facilitate the identification and prioritisation of the most
   pressing indicators accompanying social impacts in a project.MethodsData
   were collected using questionnaire(s), structured interviews, and
   through targeted focus group sessions. Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)
   approach was used to model the obtained data from structured interviews.
   Using IFS, this research also accounts for missing or ambiguous data
   that emerged during the data elicitation process. In combining IFS with
   multi-attribute decision-making techniques, the social impacts of
   selected stakeholders were evaluated using fuzzy set and IFS approaches.
   Sensitivity analysis was then used to test the robustness of the results
   and ranking was conducted based on each social stakeholder
   subcategory.Results and discussionResults revealed that approximately
   23\% of missing datapoints in the public case study building were
   incorporated in the S-LCIA using IFS. The issues of highest priority in
   each of the considered subcategory in the public case study building
   project according to IFS are (i) consumer privacy by adopting more
   functional planning (0.27), (ii) public commitment to sustainability
   (0.33), and (iii) education provided in the local community by having an
   indigenous botanical element for children (0.39), respectively.
   Conversely, the FS technique inferred that the issue of highest priority
   in the consumer stakeholder is the feedback mechanism (0.26). The
   overall degree of correlation between the IFS and FS is only 0.234,
   revealing that IFS provides a different perspective from conventional FS
   when used in modelling social data.ConclusionThe IFS method provides an
   objective and systematic approach for dealing with a heterogeneous scope
   of imprecise and inexact social data in achieving holistic social life
   cycle assessment results. Furthermore, expansive stakeholder involvement
   would rely on a robust approach for improving social well-being in
   public buildings, thereby leaving no one behind in accomplishing a
   sustainable world.},

Title = {Seismic Analysis and Damage Evaluation of RC Frame Structures Based on
   BIM Platform},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {In order to overcome the shortcomings in integrating the building
   information modeling (BIM) and seismic finite element technique for
   building structures, a new seismic analysis and damage evaluation method
   for reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures was proposed by
   integrating Revit and OpenSees, in which the information about geometric
   and material of the existing BIM model in Revit was extracted as part of
   the finite element analysis model of OpenSees; supplementary settings
   about the element type, material constitutive model, load information,
   and analysis type for finite element analysis were made according to the
   input format of OpenSees, and OpenSees program was directly called for
   numerical analysis in the Revit software which realized seismic analysis
   and damage evaluation of RC frame structures based on BIM. RTO, a
   revolutionary structural seismic analysis and damage evaluation tool
   based on the three-tier architecture theory, was created by combining
   Revit and OpenSees via the RevitAPI interface. The preprocessing module
   was created to contact OpenSees for finite element analysis, the
   postprocessing module was created to secondary analyze, display, and
   export the analysis data, and crucial structural seismic damage
   information was automatically saved in the Revit model. A calculation
   example of a five-story RC frame structure was provided to demonstrate
   the operation process of the proposed method and the developed program.
   The example proved the feasibility of integrating the BIM and finite
   element method in elastic-plastic structural seismic analysis. The
   proposed approach would facilitate the participation of structural
   seismic analysis in BIM life cycle collaboration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Recent technological advances in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry, including the implementation of building
   information modeling (BIM) and automated data-capturing tools, have
   enabled the AEC industry to commence its digital journey in the era of
   big data. Over the last decade, e-permitting practices have been
   introduced in many municipal jurisdictions around the world, aimed at
   replacing the traditional and inefficient paper-based practices. In this
   paper, these recent international developments are investigated, and
   three distinct levels of e-permitting are defined based on their varying
   levels of automation and integration. A framework is then developed that
   considers the impact of each level of e-permitting on the entire life
   cycle of the project, from submission of permitting document through
   construction, operation, and maintenance of the built facility. The
   developed framework can be used as a road map for any municipality for
   advancing from traditional paper-based permitting practices (Level 0) to
   a fully integrated city planning tool (Level 3), thus enabling several
   smart urban management applications, including city-level planning
   reviews, integrated logistics planning, and smart urban asset
   management. The framework as a whole was validated by a group of experts
   on construction permitting practices. Specific elements of its lower
   levels have been implemented by municipalities around the world, which
   have reported significant productivity improvements. Finally, this paper
   investigates several barriers to implementing the higher levels of
   e-permitting, along with corresponding strategies for municipalities to
   mitigate and overcome these challenges.},

Abstract = {In the light of the current global trends of sustainability and digital
   technologies, Building Information Modeling (BIM) proved the efficiency
   of its applications in supporting architects and designers to achieve
   sustainability during all stages of the project life cycle. Despite the
   availability of various studies about BIM trends and techniques and its
   related applications in global markets, those related to Saudi Arabia
   did not include sufficient data about the real status of its
   availability and the challenges facing its application in the local
   market. This status represents the research gap and problem of this
   paper that aims to bridge the gap and provide the necessary information
   about BIM top trends and challenges that could support architects and
   designers in enhancing the efficiency of building energy consumption.
   The information also aims to support the decision makers in prioritizing
   these trends and challenges, directing the related support, and
   addressing the necessary measures to handle BIM related challenges. The
   paper adopted the descriptive analytical approach to achieve its
   objectives through two parts: the first depends on the literature review
   to explore BIM top trends and challenges in the field of enhancing
   building energy efficiency, while the second depends on the field survey
   to explore the real status of practicing in the Saudi local market
   including the trends of availability, relational importance and the
   challenges of its application. Moreover, the significance of this paper
   as being considered one of emanates from the initiatives to achieve the
   goals of the digital transformation program for the Kingdom's Vision
   2030, and to bridge the research gap found in this field. It is expected
   that the results would support executives and officials in the
   government sections related to achieving the Kingdom's Vision 2030, and
   help the decision-making centers identify the priorities for supporting
   applying top trends of Building Information Modeling and address the
   measures needed to handle the challenges facing its application.},

   user proficiency is low. Further, the ratio of users who abandon BIM
   utilization is rather high. This is mainly due to the introduction of
   BIM in a situation wherein the organizations are not ready for the
   various elements required to utilize BIM. This pattern creates
   limitations in obtaining the expected effects of BIM and results in
   reduced continued use due a decrease in BIM credibility. Therefore, this
   research aims to develop a Discriminant Model of BIM Acceptance
   Readiness in a Construction Organization to evaluate readiness for
   elements required to utilize BIM. To empirically verify the proposed
   model, we retrieved 164 completed questionnaires by construction
   organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers
   and engineers). Using SPSS 17.0, we conducted discriminant analysis. The
   validated model will increase awareness on the need to evaluate BIM
   acceptance readiness and predict BIM acceptance readiness.},

Abstract = {To consider disassembly from project inception is becoming an essential
   part of the design process. This approach enables the reuse and
   recycling of materials at the end of the life cycle of buildings,
   reducing the need for raw materials to produce new products whilst
   increasing a building's flexibility during any potential
   reconfiguration. Above all, disassembly contributes to sustainability
   within the sector. Little is known however about designing for future
   disassembly. In general, the design phase of construction projects tends
   to focus efforts on constructability, with the value of disassembly only
   becoming apparent during the decommissioning of a building. The
   construction sector is unfamiliar with the disassembly approach and the
   comprehensive information management process, linking design and
   decommissioning for over 60 years. Regarding this, advances in Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) research offer opportunities for further
   developing the field of design for disassembly (DfD) in construction
   projects. Addressing this knowledge gap, this research explores the
   structuring of DfD information enabled by BIM to support integrated
   design decision-making in construction. This applied research project is
   inherently exploratory and based on design science research. DfD
   principles were identified through a literature review. Primary data was
   collected through case-study research, informing the development of an
   integrated DfD information model for measuring disassembly levels,
   restricted to the most common materials and construction systems used in
   Brazil. This research presents both a contribution to practice, by
   developing an information model structure to support DfD and integrated
   design, also to DfD knowledge by proposing a disassembly classification
   system.},

Abstract = {Das Instandhaltungsmanagement von Bauwerken der Infrastruktur ist eine
   herausfordernde Aufgabe. Ingenieurbauwerke auf Stra ss en und
   Schienenwegen sind charakterisiert durch lange Nutzungszeiten von 100
   Jahren und mehr. Im Rahmen der Nutzungszeit ergeben sich daher besondere
   Anforderungen an eine lebenszyklusorientierte Datenorganisation, die
   Informationen aus Planung und Bau, aber insbesondere aus dem Betrieb
   erfassen muss. Hierfur stehen den Betreibern i. d. R.
   Bauwerksmanagementsysteme (BMS) zur Verfugung, die eine bauwerksbezogene
   Datenorganisation ermoglichen. Durch den Einsatz neuer digitaler
   Methoden, wie Building Information Modeling (BIM), konnen insbesondere
   die Datenorganisation und die Prozesse der Zusammenarbeit in der
   Instandhaltung unterstutzt werden. Grundlage bilden objektorientierte
   Bauwerksmodelle, die neben der Geometrie die semantischen Informationen
   strukturieren und Verknupfungen zu weiteren Datenplattformen
   ermoglichen. Der Aufsatz stellt dar, wie diese Modelle moglichst
   effizient als geometrisch vereinfachte Bauwerksmodelle - sog. abstrakte
   Bauwerksmodelle - erstellt werden und somit Anwendungsfelder fur eine
   digitale Instandhaltung geschaffen werden konnen. Die geometrische
   Abstraktion ermoglicht es insbesondere fur Bestandsbauwerke, effizient
   digitale Bauwerksmodelle zu erzeugen und mit semantischen Informationen
   anzureichern. Diese konnen die Grundlage fur eine
   Informationsanreicherung, eine weitere Detaillierung oder eine
   strukturierte Schadensverortung am digitalen Modell bilden.
   Abstract Abstraction of digital building models as a basis for
   sensor-based maintenance management The maintenance management of
   infrastructure is a challenging task. Engineering structures like roads
   and bridges are characterized by long service lives of 100 years and
   more. Within the framework of the period of use, special requirements
   therefore arise for a life-cycle-oriented data organization that records
   information from both planning and construction, but especially from
   operation. For this purpose, operators usually have building management
   systems at their disposal that enable building-related data
   organization. The use of new digital methods, such as Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), can support the organization of data in
   particular and also the processes of cooperation in maintenance. The
   basis is formed by object-oriented building models, which structure
   semantic information and enable links to further data platforms. The
   article provides a contribution on how geometrically abstract building
   models can already be used to intelligently structure data for
   maintenance processes. Geometric abstraction makes it possible to
   efficiently generate digital building models, especially for existing
   buildings, and to enrich them with semantic information. This can form
   the basis for linking information with other data platforms or for
   damage localization on the digital model.},

Abstract = {One problem faced by managers who are using project management models is
   the elicitation of numerical inputs. Obtaining these with any degree of
   confidence early in a project is not always feasible. Related to this
   difficulty is the risk of precisely specified outputs from models
   leading to overcommitment, These problems can be seen as the collective
   failure of software measurements to represent the inherent uncertainties
   in managers' knowledge of the development products, resources, and
   processes. rt is proposed that fuzzy logic techniques can help to
   overcome same of these difficulties by representing the imprecision in
   inputs and outputs, as well as providing a more expert-knowledge based
   approach to model building. The use of fuzzy logic for project
   management however should not be the same throughout the development
   life cycle. Different levels of available information and desired
   precision suggest that it can be used differently depending on the
   current phase, although a single model can be used for consistency.},

Title = {Dealing with uncertainties in comparative building life cycle assessment},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {242},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Building LCA aims at guiding designers towards more sustainable
   projects. Many sources of uncertainties affect environmental modelling.
   Therefore, the reliability of decisions based on building LCA is
   questioned. However, information on uncertainties can strengthen
   decisions, when properly addressed. In this study, seven statistical
   metrics are compared based on dependent samplings for sensitivity
   analyses (SA) and uncertainty analyses (UA). It allows to identify a set
   of indicators on which conclusions are more reliable. For the first
   time, this method-ology is applied to comparative building LCA,
   considering three construction alternatives: a concrete, a concrete
   blocks and a wooden-framed house. A new SA method, based on Morris,
   helps identifying which of 153 uncertain factors are more likely to
   influence decisions. More precise data is then collected on these
   uncertain factors. In this case study, the Heijungs significance metric
   and the distribution of relative differences were the most appropriate
   metrics to assess UA results. They allow to determine, for each
   indicator, which is the best alternative and how much better it
   performs. Consequently, the non-conclusive indicators are discarded.
   Applying this methodology, decision are enhanced by uncertainties and
   rely on a smaller set of indicators to select an alter-native in terms
   of environmental performance.},

Abstract = {Modern construction projects are (unlike earlier projects) very complex
   and complicated. Hitherto approaches are therefore proving to be
   problematic or even unusable. Therefore new approaches are created,
   usually based on the modeling methods. One of such methodology is the
   methodology BIM (Building Information Modeling), which attempts to cover
   the entire life cycle of a construction project. This methodology has a
   boom in recent years. However, there appear objective difficulties that
   impede wider application of the methodology. In this article I will deal
   with one of these problems. This is a vague process model based on
   non-standard methodology for process modeling. The resulting process
   models show considerable ambiguity and do not provide the information
   that we rightly expect from such a process model. The aim is to identify
   the major problems of the methodology used and describe how they have
   (or could have) an impact on the comprehensibility of the existing
   process model. Then we will form a basis of methodology really useful
   for a comprehensive description of the process model. This methodology
   will be based on existing and sophisticated methodology BPMN, which will
   eventually domain-specifically adapted to the needs of BIM and
   construction.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is energy-intensive and labor-intensive, which
   has great potential in reducing energy demand and carbon emissions. The
   construction method of off-site prefabricated components has many
   advantages to make it a good substitute for traditional methods. The
   purpose of this paper is to reduce the carbon emissions of prefabricated
   residential concrete members by improving the standardization rate of
   prefabricated components in the architectural design stage. In addition,
   this paper also uses building information modeling technology to
   establish Revit models and develops Revit using C\# language to achieve
   rapid calculation of the prefabrication rate of building and
   standardization rate of components. The calculation results of the case
   show that, in the design stage, the carbon emissions are reduced by
   2034.16 kg CO(2)e by improving the standardization rate of prefabricated
   components, accounting for 0.1552\% of the carbon emissions of all
   prefabricated components. This study can help the designer reduce the
   carbon emissions of prefabricated components, and this technology may
   make a significant contribution in improving the environmental
   sustainability of prefabricated buildings.},

Abstract = {The maintenance of port infrastructures presents difficulties due to
   their location: an aggressive environment or the variability of the
   waves can cause progressive deterioration. Maritime conditions make
   inspections difficult and, added to the lack of use of efficient tools
   for the management of assets, planning maintenance, important to ensure
   operability throughout the life cycle of port infrastructures, is
   generally not a priority. In view of these challenges, this research
   proposes a methodology for the creation of a port infrastructure asset
   management tool, generated based on the Design Science Research Method
   (DSRM), in line with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   digitization trends in the infrastructure sector. The proposal provides
   workflows and recommendations for the survey of port infrastructures
   from UAVs, the reconstruction of digital models by photogrammetry (due
   to scarce technical documentation), and the reconstruction of BIM
   models. Along with this, the bidirectional linking of traditional asset
   management spreadsheets with BIM models is proposed, by visual
   programming, allowing easy visualization of the status and maintenance
   requirements. This methodology was applied to a port infrastructure,
   where the methodology demonstrated the correct functionality of the
   asset management tool, which allows a constant up-dating of information
   regarding the structural state of the elements and the necessary
   maintenance activities.},

Abstract = {The competence of leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   technology in the early project stages is critical to drive its efficacy
   throughout the project life cycle. However, a review of the literature
   indicated a lack of research into upskilling undergraduate students in
   civil engineering and construction management (CECM) majors,
   particularly with respect to such competencies as using BIM in design,
   planning, processing, managing, and communicating complex projects. To
   better facilitate the skills for undergraduate students, this study
   formulated an innovative framework using Kolb's experiential learning
   (EL) with tailored BIM capstone course activities for project planning
   and implementations. This framework includes concrete experience,
   reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active
   experimentation. It provides the necessary integration of EL, the BIM
   planning guide, and pedagogies of capstone courses. It helps instructors
   to monitor and control learning activities based on the BIM planning
   guide and to test hypotheses through experiments. The framework includes
   features of group work involvement, connection with practical
   information, and student-centered learning. Subsequent surveys of
   students and teachers provided further evidence of the framework merits,
   specifically in terms of the improved formation of student cognition of
   BIM-based project planning (90\% improvement), in addition to enhanced
   capabilities in process mapping (70\% improvement), software operation
   (80\% improvement), and information exchange (100\% improvement). The
   proposed framework sets an innovative pedagogical rationale to which
   university-based BIM education can refer and upskills undergraduate
   students, expanding their capabilities in information and communication
   technology in the context of EL.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The construction industry worldwide is looking for overall
   efficiency in the entire project life cycle. Lean construction and
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) are together, key constituents in
   this quest. This study looks to reinforce the contribution of BIM to
   deliver applied lean principles to enhance productivity and performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts mixed methodologies of
   Ethnographic Action Research (EAR) and crisp set Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (csQCA). The mosaic of case studies provides a descriptive and
   instrumental approach. While a descriptive approach investigates the
   interventions and phenomenon relating BIM to Lean, an instrumental
   approach constitutes exemplars of the interrelated phenomenon of BIM and
   Lean.
   Findings - The themes of Elimination of Waste, Kaizen, Respecting the
   Human Elements, Poke-a-Yoke and Jidoka are contributed to the maximum by
   BIM. All the case studies discussed evidence of the contribution to
   Lean, as they enhance end-customer value.
   Research limitations/implications - The contribution of BIM towards Lean
   could encourage collaborations amongst stakeholders for mutual benefits.
   BIM could enhance decision making, predictive simulation, risk analysis,
   etc. with many other exciting possibilities of delivering productivity
   and performance. The study is limited by the insights offered by the
   individual cases.
   Originality/value - The study provides insights into potential
   developments and research. It is expected to encourage reflective
   professional practice triggered by innovative thinking for the gainful
   utilization of BIM to deliver Lean.},

Abstract = {Solving complex issues of energy-efficiency - at the building as well as
   urban level - requires a holistic, integrated approach. The energetic
   behavior of a system should not only be considered in individual
   processes or phases, such as operation. A holistic optimization should
   rather consider the explicit energy flows as well as the material fluxes
   including the associated gray energies over the entire system life
   cycle. The realization of such a holistic integral planning process
   implies an integrated planning-accompanying evaluation and optimization
   of the planned object. The early use of LCA tools and sustainable
   building assessment systems (SBA) provides an important basis for
   assessing planning decisions at a conceptual level for their impact on
   the entire lifecycle of a building and for ensuring good sustainability
   performance.
   In practice, however, it is currently evident that the non-standardized
   and inadequate connection of simulation and balancing tools (e.g. LCA)
   to BIM authoring tools and the resulting high time expenditure for data
   acquisition and LCA application counteracts with a targeted stronger
   penetration of the market.
   For realizing a consistent integral planning process - especially in
   early planning phases - an IFC-based interface is being developed for
   the connection of LCA tools to BIM models (data input) and the
   preparation and configuration of the LCA result data for the designated
   use in different SBA. In this contribution, from the interface
   specifications for different levels of granularity and concretization in
   the different planning phases that are developed by means of norm-based
   processes of model standardization in an underlying research project,
   parts regarding the early project stages will be presented.},

Abstract = {In recent years, and despite the effects of the economic crisis in the
   building sector, technicians involved in the architectural process had
   to adapt themselves to many changes, in search of new job opportunities.
   In this situation, traditional methods imposed by computer-aided design
   (CAD) in the development of new projects have evolved towards the use of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodologies, enabling the control
   of different aspects such as the design, construction and monitoring of
   a building; the implementation of this new approach has meant essential
   updating of construction professionals towards a new global coordination
   paradigm throughout the complete life cycle of a building. In order to
   analyse these demanded skills acquired by technicians with previous
   experience both in traditional CAD systems and BIM environments, a study
   has been carried out to determine (by comparison) the outstanding
   aspects about the use of BIM systems, taking into account the modelling
   process. To do so, a simple practical exercise of modelling using both
   AutoCAD and Revit software has been carried out with the participation
   of students and professionals within the building sector. Necessary data
   were obtained and later evaluated through simple regression considering
   the time dedicated to the modelling resolution; also, different variance
   analyses were conducted to identify alterations between the different
   categories and groups considered, taking into account factors such as
   gender, having a previous university degree or not, years of experience
   with CAD or BIM software, type of academic qualifications or having
   attended previous training courses (among others).},

Abstract = {The EU members have adopted regulations and official methods for
   evaluating the energy performance in buildings. Most of these methods
   are applied at the end of the project phase, with few opportunities to
   correct erroneous design decisions when the desired building energy
   performance is not achieved. It is demonstrated that there is no
   European standard for sustainability and that the decision-making
   process during the development of a building project is compromised by
   the methodologies and some concepts, as thermal inertia, are withdrawn.
   Currently, the industry has been developing alternative tools for
   evaluating energy performance and CO2 emissions in buildings over their
   entire life cycle. These software programs, which belong to the BIM
   environment, use databases and make simplifications adapted to the stage
   of design when the software can be applied. The main objective of this
   paper is to evaluate the accuracy of this software and how the databases
   and simplifications influence the decision-making process in building
   design. Calculation examples are carried out with various tools and
   compared to real building performance data. The results demonstrate
   that, as with the official methods, the tools influence the results and

Title = {BIM for FM: understanding information quality issues in terms of
   compliance with owner's Building Information Modeling Requirements},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {The promise of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for Facilities
   Management (FM) is based upon building information models as reliable
   sources of information for decisions during a facility's life cycle,
   from the planning to end of life. However, the premise of BIM as an
   enabler for the delivery of reliable information for FM has numerous
   challenges. Previous studies have shown that the quality of information
   provided through current design practices with BIM is inadequate for FM.
   These information quality (IQ) issues are mostly related to incomplete,
   inaccurate, inconsistent, and unintelligible facility information that
   ultimately reduce the usefulness of BIM-based information for FM
   purposes. In order to support BIM-enabled delivery of useful asset
   information for FM, certain IQ criteria must be met. Based on three
   ethnographic case studies, including the analysis of more than two
   thousand documented BIM for FM-related compliance issues, this research
   identifies ten key IQ criteria in design BIMs that must be considered to
   reliably support BIM use for FM, correlates these IQ criteria with key
   IQ dimensions identified in the literature to reflect their frequency of
   occurrence, and identifies sources of IQ issues in BIM for FM within
   design practice. A mixed-method approach for data collection from the
   case studies is adopted, including document analysis, semi-structured
   interviews, meeting observation, and a survey. The data collected are
   analyzed through an iterative coding process, in which the themes
   emerged are refined and tested as part of a grounded theory approach.
   This study contributes to the development of the theoretical concept of
   IQ in BIM for FM that is grounded in data from actual projects with
   stringent BIM requirements for FM and thorough compliance processes. As
   a practical contribution, the findings in this study should enable
   owners and designers to develop a more optimized asset information
   delivery process, increasing the value of the information in design BIMs
   for operations with minimal impact on current modeling practices.},

Title = {SAB: An open-access Python-based integrated platform for fully automated
   emergent sustainability assessment of biorefineries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {632-651},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {PurposeThe ability of biorefineries to simultaneously produce energy and
   materials from biomass is a key factor in their role as a fundamental
   solution for enabling the circular economy. Research in this field is
   primarily focused on measuring and improving the sustainability of
   biorefineries. Nevertheless, the evaluation of biorefineries'
   sustainability faces a significant challenge due to their emergent
   nature. This challenge stems from inadequate data availability or the
   presence of data that is fraught with uncertainties and risks, which
   hampers the assessment process. Consequently, it becomes imperative to
   undertake comprehensive and extensive analyses of risks and
   uncertainties to tackle this issue effectively. In addition to this,
   data simulation also requires subsequent manual steps to transfer these
   data into assessment software. All these requirements for a
   comprehensive sustainability assessment combined can accumulate into a
   resource-demanding, time-consuming, and energy-intensive task.
   Furthermore, most studies neglect the trade-off between different
   sustainability aspects and fully comprehend the relative relevance of
   input elements impacting sustainability. The aforementioned issues
   reduce the accuracy of biorefinery sustainability assessments.Research
   methodologyTo overcome these challenges, an automated open-access
   python-based integrated modular platform, named SAB (Sustainability
   Assessment of Biorefineries), was developed to perform the environmental
   and economic assessment of biorefineries. SAB extracts the data required
   for building the life cycle inventory from the ASPEN model. It performs
   life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) while taking the
   input parameters' uncertainty into account. It also determines the
   impact of input parameters on LCA and LCC results by carrying out a
   Global Sensitivity Analysis. In addition, SAB evaluates the
   sustainability performance of a variety of scenarios based on a
   trade-off decision-making algorithm to determine the scenario with the
   least environmental and economic risk. To illustrate the capability of
   SAB, three case studies for lignocellulose-based biorefinery are
   presented in this paper.Results and conclusionOverall, the SAB tool
   enables the evaluation of LCA and LCC of biorefineries transparently in
   an automated manner. It can be employed as a decision-making tool that
   gives information about the environmental and economic risks of multiple
   scenarios. SAB also supports the development of a more sustainable
   biorefinery concept by giving information about the effects of different
   variables on LCA and LCC results.},

Abstract = {Purpose Although building information modelling (BIM) brings various
   benefits and open up the construction industry to many new
   possibilities, it is not without some challenges. Blockchain has the
   potential to resolve some of these problems. It has shown that
   blockchain and BIM can potentially work together in bringing various
   benefits to all project stakeholders. However, there is a lack of
   research and knowledge in relation to blockchain-based BIM. Therefore,
   the purpose of this study is to close this gap by looking into the
   potential functionality and workability of blockchain within a BIM
   environment. Design/methodology/approach A four-stage preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses systematic
   literature review technique has been used to review the blockchain- and
   BIM-related information sources published. A total of 53 journal
   articles, 13 books and 27 other resources including that of reports and
   websites have been included in this paper. Findings Blockchain-based BIM
   has countless possibilities, ranging from simple tasks such as tracking
   of orders to automation of construction payment claims. The literatures
   have suggested that the several weaknesses that BIM possesses including
   trust issue, asset ownership issue and data reliability issue could be
   resolved by incorporating blockchain into its processes.
   Originality/value Because of the lack of researches on the workability
   of blockchain and BIM, this paper aims to close this gap by proposing a
   framework for the interaction between blockchain and BIM for a typical
   building project. This paper has reviewed a substantial amount of
   currently available knowledge on blockchain-based BIM and its relevancy
   to the construction industry. This paper believes that the information
   could be of use to potential BIM tools maker and the construction
   industry for the betterment of BIM implementation throughout a project

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Security of information in collaborative BIM platforms is crucial
   particularly for critical projects such as that of government buildings,
   prisons, and power plants. Inappropriate distribution and loss of
   sensitive information may potentially lead to physical security threats,
   financial loss, and loss of trust and reputation. Therefore, this paper
   identifies the information security requirements of collaborative BIM
   platforms considering the characteristics related to data security of
   collaborative BIM platforms through a literature review and as a result,
   identifies seven components of BIM security, based on which defines
   three levels of BIM security.
   Existing cybersecurity facilitating technologies such as encryption
   protocols, distributed database technology, and blockchain technology
   are reviewed to assess applicability to BIM security. This review shows
   that although the technologies to support BIM security are available in
   research and on market, they are not customized in existing
   collaborative BIM platforms to support BIM security. Therefore, two
   conceptual frameworks are proposed - (1) an encryption strategy-based
   framework to facilitate secure storage and distribution of BIM and (2) a
   blockchain-based framework to record BIM changes in a tamper-proof
   ledger for the non-trusting environment of construction projects.
   Discussions on cost and functionality are provided, which will be
   further extended in the future.},

Abstract = {Purpose The improper evaluation and information management of circular
   economy (CE) (i.e. design, planning, supply chain, waste pile and
   material hazard) is critical for public health and is a major problem in
   the waste management of precast concrete (PC) building manufacture and
   construction and demolition wastes industry. The CE model is
   particularly problematic for PC building construction projects where the
   standard practices for the total number of waste building materials are
   not appropriate and do not match the safe disposal design specification,
   such as the recent number increase in the Malaysian illegal construction
   waste pile during the Movement Control Order (11 March 2021, about 5 out
   of 29 landfills related to states enforcing Act 672). The study aims to
   develop a framework application (i.e. Building Information Modelling
   {[}BIM]) that supports intelligent waste recycling management and
   sophisticated CE model system solutions. Design/methodology/approach
   Thus, the development of a new BIM-based programming algorithm approach
   is proposed for optimising CE in accordance with the needs of the
   current PC building construction schemes. As a precursor to this study,
   the concepts of CE practices are reviewed and the main features of BIM
   tools and techniques currently being employed on such projects are
   presented. Findings Sophisticated CE system solutions are described as
   an essential component of this optimisation to reduce the amount of
   waste generated at the end of the life cycle of PC building construction
   projects and to better manage the resources used throughout it.

Abstract = {Digitalization and consistency of information about existing buildings,
   held by the owners, facility managers, local and national authorities,
   is a common issue for asset management or any other building life-cycle
   analysis or optimization. The digital twin concept could provide the
   solution; however, the creation of appropriate input data has been the
   main roadblock in adoption and application. The information needs for
   creation of digital twins of existing buildings are vast and as such
   none of the existing research approaches and/or algorithms are capable
   of holistic data collection to be used as input. A prevailing method for
   gathering geometrical data of existing assets is laser scanning, where a
   point cloud with high precision and high data volume is produced. The
   detection of geometrical and/or semantic information from the point
   cloud data has been recently a goal of many research initiatives;
   however they were usually focused on single purpose data extraction,
   thus limiting wider application. In the paper, an ontology-based
   approach of information creation is presented that minimizes human
   assistance, interaction with raw data and processing resources while
   increasing expressive power of the asset's digital twin model for more
   efficient reasoning.},

Abstract = {One of the challenges in the domain of building is directly exchange
   model data without human interaction among various software vendors. The
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) serves as a common product model
   between similar and dissimilar IT systems for the architecture,
   engineering, construction, and facility management(AEC/FM) industries
   covering all life-cycle phases. According to the research on the IFC
   standard and the middle ware technology, this paper establishes an IFC
   mapping model that supports the data exchange and sharing. Based on this
   IFC mapping model, an IFC interface widget with IFCs data input and
   output functions for STEP Part21 file is proposed and compiled. The
   techniques and methods adopted in this development are also depicted in
   detail. Finally, an example is provided to verify the proposed IFC
   parser tool, showing how to exchange model data between Revit
   Architecture and our building information management platform. The
   purpose of this paper is trying to develop a common method for the data
   sharing and reusing by adopting IFC standard. This paper provides the
   reference for similar software development.},

Abstract = {Buildings consume a significant proportion of the world's resources,
   mostly in the form of materials usage. In addition, with the ongoing
   efforts focusing on reducing the operational energy consumption of
   buildings, the embodied emissions of buildings are expected to increase
   in proportion in the future. With the increasing focus placed on the
   embodied emissions of buildings, organizations in the construction
   industry will face requirements to report information regarding the
   embodied emissions of buildings. However, in order to obtain the
   embodied emission of buildings, tremendous efforts have to be placed as
   the process is data intensive. In order to overcome this challenge, a
   streamlined technique is proposed to minimize the efforts required by
   practitioner to obtain the embodied carbon footprint. The proposed
   technique comprises a probabilistic model of emission factor estimators
   used to estimate the required embodied emissions. Based on the four
   projects presented as case study for the proposed technique, the
   practitioner would be required to manually match the appropriate
   emission factors to the activity data for between 12 and 21\% of the
   data points. This is in contrast to the current traditional technique,
   which requires the manual matching of 100\% of data points. The
   resultant deviation of the computed embodied carbon footprint from the
   proposed technique and the current technique was between -0.25\% and
   +3.65\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the civil engineering supervision, the management processes about
   personnel, materials, quality, safety, schedule and etc. are complex,
   which include large amount of data, involve more participants, and
   timely coordination and feedback is difficult. In this paper, we propose
   the data integration idea based on data-driven, which could guide the
   whole life cycle of civil engineering supervision from the top-level
   data organization, supervision of business processes, the interactive
   units and the users, the four-elements method TDTM and so on. Then, the
   data integration algorithms of civil engineering supervision are put
   forward to integrate the civil engineering supervision data from outside
   to inside and from coarse-grained to fine-grained, eliminate
   contradictions and redundancy and ensure data consistency. Finally, the
   civil engineering supervision data entities are determined, and we
   further analyze and discuss its query and report, data maintenance and
   conversion, and compare the functions in the different supervision
   platform. The civil engineering supervision unified data platform
   proposed could maintain the independence of the data, have the good
   scalability and support the more functions.},

Title = {An Automated IoT Visualization BIM Platform for Decision Support in
   Facilities Management},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the digital representation of
   physical and functional characteristics (such as geometry, spatial
   relationship, and geographic information) of a facility to support
   decisions during its life cycle. BIM has been extended beyond 3D
   geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a
   fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other
   applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of
   Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart
   homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and
   entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two
   technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused
   exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM
   models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize
   sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support
   complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study
   uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios,
   such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving
   options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical
   equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the
   design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with
   different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept
   sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in
   BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management
   decisions.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Driven by global sustainability trends, Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) technology is increasingly becoming a key tool in the construction
   industry to improve efficiency and sustainability. This study aims to
   identify the key factors affecting BIM implementation in the context of
   Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) and to construct a theoretical framework for BIM
   implementation based on these factors. To achieve this objective, this
   study used a systematic literature review (SLR) method to systematically
   review the relevant literature between 2009 and 2024 and identified 16
   key factors from the selected 406 studies through keyword co-occurrence
   analysis (using VOSviewer 1.6.20) and data coding. These key factors
   include top management support for ESG and SDGs, alignment of SDGs, ESG
   integration, technical support, BIM software, BIM hardware, structural
   adjustment and collaboration, capacity building, change management,
   skill and attitude, educational training and development, incentive
   mechanism, roles and responsibilities, sustainable construction
   practices, policies and regulations, and resource efficiency. This study
   categorises these factors under the Strategy, Technology, Organisation,
   People, Environment (STOPE) framework and proposes a theoretical
   implementation framework for BIM accordingly. The findings not only
   provide a practical guiding framework for the sustainable development of
   construction companies in the context of ESG and SDG integration but
   also lay a solid theoretical foundation for future empirical research.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Knowledge engineering stems from E. A. Figenbaum's proposal in 1977, but
   it will enter a new decade with the new challenges. This paper first
   summarizes three knowledge engineering experiments we have undertaken to
   show possibility of separating knowledge development from intelligent
   software development. We call it the ICAX mode of intelligent
   application software generation. The key of this mode is to generate
   knowledge base, which is the source of intelligence of ICAX software,
   independently and parallel to intelligent software development. That
   gives birth to a new and more general concept ``knowware{''}. Knowware
   is a commercialized knowledge module with documentation and intellectual
   property, which is computer operable, but free of any built-in control
   mechanism, meeting some industrial standards and embeddable in
   software/hardware. The process of development, application and
   management of knowware is called knowware engineering. Two different
   knowware life cycle models are discussed: the furnace model and the
   crystallization model. Knowledge middleware is a class of software
   functioning in all aspects of knowware life cycle models. Finally, this
   paper also presents some examples of building knowware in the domain of
   information system engineering.},

Title = {BIM Requirements in the Spanish Public Tender-Analysis of Adoption in
   Construction Contracts},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly
   widespread within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction \&
   Operations (AECO) sector. BIM allows the construction of a digital scale
   model of the asset to be built, ensuring the early detection of
   conflicts and interferences, enabling communication between the
   different participant agents, and facilitating the processes in the
   maintenance and management phase. Studies on the subject are many and
   varied. However, very few works refer to the inclusion of BIM in the
   public procurement stage, one of the most complex and competitive stages
   within the asset's life cycle. A bibliographic review has been conducted
   about the BIM situation in the AECO sector contracts, the existing
   problems and the possible solutions to implement. In the specific field
   of public procurement, Spain has made great progress, especially at the
   regional level. During 2020, a total of 440 tenders with BIM
   requirements were published, with an investment volume of EUR 752
   million, which represents an increase of 230\% compared to 2017. The aim
   of this research is to analyze the Spanish public procurement,
   highlighting the progress made so far in the implementation of this
   technology, as well as to develop a proposal of BIM requirements that,
   in general, could be used as a reference for tenders of the AECO sector
   in the country. With this objective, a selection of twenty relevant
   public tenders is made, covering both the building and infrastructure
   fields. The requirements address areas such as: BIM uses, BIM
   deliverables, model structure, Level of Development, Common Data
   Environment, classification systems, standards or quality control.},

Abstract = {The research project ``Next Generation Residential High-Rise{''} aims at
   reducing the environmental impact of future housing developments in
   high-density urban environments. The main goal of the research is the
   development of a software tool that evaluates the consequences of early
   and intermediate design decisions for the Global Warming Potential (GWP)
   of buildings. Based on modular floorplan layouts with a systemic
   division into a permanent support and a flexible infill system {[}1, 2],
   this tool will help to determine the interdepending material ratios of
   alternative load-bearing systems and the respectively required infill
   components. As an integral component, it also considers the impact of
   alterations within the infill system during a building's service
   lifetime. The increasingly heterogeneous nature and the rapidly changing
   demands of society have led to a broad multiplicity of ideas on possible
   housing forms {[}3], which in general require a higher degree of
   flexibility. As they have the potential of increasing the service
   lifetime of a building, facilitating alterations will thus become more
   important. The final version of the software tool will also provide
   insights on long-term costs and possible financial benefits. This paper
   focuses on the role of materials and structural systems in the
   geographical context of Southeast Asia, and here with a focus on
   Singapore. It presents the results of two preliminary LCA-based studies,
   each of which compares the GWP of three construction variants of a
   notional case-study building. The paper also elaborates on how the
   software tool will facilitate the evaluation of decisions regarding
   materiality and structural systems in the future.},

Title = {Overcoming challenges in life cycle assessment of smart energy systems -
   A map of solution approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {423},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Current research underlines the benefits of digitalization to integrate
   renewable energy sources (RES) efficiently and to coordinate generation
   and supply. This development towards smart energy systems (SES) includes
   emerging use cases at the distribution grid level, e.g., smart charging
   strategies for electric vehicles or energy management systems in
   buildings. An environmental assessment of such, however, is challenging.
   The standardized Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches seem
   insufficient since SES are emerging systems at the interface of
   digitalization and energy with multiple intended and unintended
   environmental effects. This article aims to derive solution approaches
   for LCA professionals that investigate use cases enabled by information
   and communication technology (ICT), specifically in SES. To identify
   challenges during the first two phases of an LCA and solution
   approaches, we examine seven recent research projects and conduct a
   real-time Delphi workshop with LCA experts in the field of SES. As a
   result, the article provides approaches on setting up an LCA, filling
   data gaps, and methods to draw upon the long-term impacts of use cases
   in SES. Key findings include a modified taxonomy of potential
   environmental effects. Results show that systemic effects in SES have
   potentially the highest impact on the LCA, followed by effects caused by
   user behavior. Assessing these effects of `higher-order' poses an
   increased complexity. Determined solution approaches include combining
   the standardized LCA with energy system modeling or surveys on user
   behavior. Overall, this article reveals orientation strategies and
   recommendations to guide LCA professionals toward a holistic
   environmental assessment of use cases in SES.},

Abstract = {Environmental impact evaluation of buildings is critical for further
   analysis and optimization of pig farms for sustainable pork production.
   This study is the first attempt to quantify the carbon and water
   footprints of a standard intensive pig farm building using building
   information modeling (BIM) and operation simulation model. The model was
   constructed with carbon emission and water consumption coefficients, and
   a database was built. The results showed that the operational stage of
   pig farm accounted for most of the carbon footprint (49.3-84.9 \%) and
   water footprint (65.5-92.5 \%). Building materials production ranked
   second in carbon (12.0-42 .5 \%) and water footprints (4.4-24.9 \%), and
   pig farm maintenance ranked third in carbon (1.7-5.7 \%) and water
   footprints (0.7-3.6 \%). Notably, the mining and production stages of
   building materials contributed the largest carbon and water footprints
   of pig farm construction. Masonry materials have a significant impact on
   the overall carbon and water footprints of the pig farm. Pig farm using
   aerated concrete could reduce 41.1 \% of the total carbon footprint and
   58.9 \% of the total water footprint compared to that using coal gangue
   sintered brick and autoclaved fly ash brick. This study presented a
   BIM-enabled method for carbon and water footprint analysis of pig farms
   and illustrated how the model can be used to facilitate the low carbon
   design of agricultural buildings.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) data provide geospatial data on
   cities and spatial analysis functions that are essential for urban
   design. Building information modeling (BIM) includes a digital entity of
   construction, a passive presentation of micro-digital information on
   real entities, and an active application of models in the entire life
   cycle realization of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industries. A combination of these technologies could provide a core
   technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city
   design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes
   the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional
   integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the
   ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in
   the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart
   cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and
   co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and
   BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional
   disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of
   GIS and BIM integration. Future research should focus on smart city
   planning, updating, management; ontology-based GIS and BIM data
   integration platform; and operation; and the collaborative management of

Title = {Integrating complex asset health modelling techniques with continuous
   time simulation modelling: A practical tool for maintenance and capital
   investments analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An Asset Health Index (AHI) is a tool that processes data about asset's
   condition. That index is intended to explore if alterations can be
   generated in the health of the asset along its life cycle. These data
   can be obtained during the asset's operation, but they can also come
   from other information sources such as geographical information systems,
   supplier's reliability records, relevant external agent's records, etc.
   The tool (AHI) provides an objective point of view to justify, for
   instance, the extension of an asset useful life, or to identify which
   assets from a fleet are candidates for an early replacement, or
   renovation, as a consequence of a premature aging. This paper describes
   how to build the AHI model as a continuous time simulation model, which
   is then implemented using Vensim simulation environment. This is done in
   order to: 1) improve model formulating robustness, 2) benefit of the
   outstanding software optimization features for AHI model parameters
   calibration; and 2) easy the provision of predictions for asset
   degradation, operational and capital investments risk under different
   possible exogenous scenarios and endogenous managerial options. The
   process of model building, and parameterization is applied to an
   industrial case of a regasification terminal. Several strategies
   involving major maintenance scheduling are compared in terms of total
   expenditure in assets over their life cycle. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Modern buildings are designed to enhance the match between environment,
   spaces and the people carrying out work, so that the well-being and the
   performance of the occupants are all in harmony. Building services are
   systems that facilitate a healthy working environment within which
   workers productivity can be optimised in the buildings. However, the
   maintenance of these services is fraught with problems that may
   contribute to up to 50\% of the total life cycle cost of the building.
   Maintenance support is one area which is not usually designed into the
   system as this is not common practice in the services industry. The
   other areas of shortfall for future designs are; client requirements,
   commissioning, facilities management data and post occupancy evaluation
   feedback which needs to be adequately planned to capture and document
   this information for use in future designs.
   At the University of Reading an integrated approach has been developed
   to assemble the multitude of aspects inherent in this field. The means
   records required and measured achievements for the benefit of both
   building owners and practitioners. This integrated approach can be
   represented in a Through Life Business Model (TLBM) format using the
   concept of Integrated Logistic Support (ILS). The prototype TLBM
   developed utilises the tailored tools and techniques of ILS for building
   services. This TLBM approach will facilitate the successful development
   of a databank that would be invaluable in capturing essential data (e.g.
   reliability of components) for enhancing future building services
   designs, life cycle costing and decision making by practitioners, in
   particular facilities managers.},

Title = {Critical Challenges for BIM Adoption in Small and Medium-Sized
   Enterprises: Evidence from China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is a set of technologies that aim
   to increase interorganisational and cross-disciplinary collaboration in
   the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries to
   promote productivity and the quality of design, construction, and
   maintenance stages of a building. Studies on BIM adoption in small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have remained an under-represented area.
   It is necessary to understand the main challenges hindering the adoption
   of BIM in SMEs and to consider corresponding strategies that can be
   applied in order to obtain further understanding of BIM in SMEs. On the
   basis of literature review and interview, stakeholder-associated factors
   were identified from a network perspective, and the social network
   analysis (SNA) method was applied to determine the interconnections
   between the influencing factors and links in BIM adoption in SMEs.
   Eventually, 10 critical factors and 10 crucial links were selected and
   divided into six challenges. Corresponding strategies, including
   cultivating the BIM perception of SMEs, integrated project delivery,
   strengthening the legal environment for BIM adoption in SMEs, and
   developing native software and standards and cloud-based technology,
   were proposed to mitigate these challenges. The strategies may help
   practitioners gain an in-depth understanding of BIM adoption in SMEs
   from a stakeholder-oriented perspective.},

Title = {Utilising Building Component Data from BIM for Formwork Planning},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION ECONOMICS AND BUILDING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {20-36},
Abstract = {Advancements in the computing realm have assisted the Architecture,
   Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to progress significantly
   by automating several design tasks and activities. Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) authoring tools have played a significant role in
   automating design tasks and reducing the efforts required by the
   designer in redundant, repetitive or production-oriented activities.
   This paper explores one such approach that, with the help of BIM
   authoring tool and its Application Programming Interface (API), reduces
   the efforts expended on formwork design for concrete structures. The
   paper utilises the concept of using BIM data as input to compute the
   quantity of formwork, and generate visualisations and schedule of
   formwork. The developed approach first takes data input from semantic
   BIM to the API environment for computation and design of formwork
   systems, which is then placed within the BIM model, to generate
   visualisation and prepare schedules. The research work utilises a
   structural concrete wall as an example to demonstrate the presented
   approach. The approach will be influential in streamlining the formwork
   design process in the BIM environment and reducing efforts required by
   the designer and the planning engineer. Since the formwork elements are
   generated as 3-Dimensional (3D) solids and smart BIM elements, the
   generated model of formwork can be used for resolving clashes,
   scheduling, and resource planning.},

Title = {Rapid structural condition assessment using radio frequency

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a wireless structural condition scanning system that
   utilizes the building information modeling (BIM) and radio frequency
   identification (RFID) based wireless strain sensor technologies to
   enable non-contact scanning of structural deformation. In buildings,
   structural members are often hidden behind drywalls, and thus buckling
   or yielding in steel members are difficult to detect, often requiring
   removal of coverings and thus time consuming and costly. Fast and
   accurate assessment of structural conditions is important to the
   occupant safety and uninterrupted use after extreme load events such as
   strong earthquakes. BIM can integrate all types of structural and
   condition assessment information collected in the life cycle of civil
   structures and also provides the visual data displaying mechanism that
   makes the structural health monitoring information easily understandable
   and actionable. Breakage-triggered (BT) strain sensor that uses RFID tag
   for non-contact scanning of structural deformation condition has been
   developed to detect the surpass of pre-set stain threshold corresponding
   to structural damage conditions such as yielding or buckling. This
   system can rapidly identify the spot where the pre-set strain threshold
   has been surpassed and the corresponding structural element in the BIM
   model would be highlighted to provide alert signal to engineers and
   decision makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Augmented reality in design and construction: thematic analysis and
   conceptual frameworks},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {412-443},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to present a comprehensive review, critical
   analysis and implications of the augmented reality (AR) application and
   implementation in the construction industry arena and demonstrate the
   gaps along with the future research agenda. Design/methodology/approach
   The construction industry has been under pressure to improve its
   productivity, quality and sustainability. However, the conventional
   methods and technologies cannot respond to this industry's ever-growing
   demands while emerging and innovative technologies such as building
   information modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality
   (VR) and AR have emerged and can be used to address this gap. AR
   application has been acknowledged as one of the most impactful
   technologies in the construction digitalization process. However, a
   comprehensive understanding of the AR application, its areas of
   effectiveness and overarching implications in a construction project
   life cycle remain vague. Therefore, this study uses an integration of
   systematic literature review and thematic analysis techniques to
   identify the phases of a construction project life cycle in which AR is
   the most effective, the current issues and problems of the conventional
   methods, the augmented parameters, the immediate effects of using AR on
   each phase and, eventually, the overall influence of AR on the entire
   project. Nvivo qualitative data analysis software was used to code,
   categorize and create themes from the collected data. The result of data
   analysis was used to develop four principal frameworks of the AR
   applications - design and constructability review session; construction
   operation; construction assembly; and maintenance and defect inspection
   and management - and the gap analysis along with the future research
   agenda. Findings The findings of this study indicated that the
   application of AR can be most effective in the following four stages of
   a project life cycle: design and constructability review session;
   construction operation; construction assembly; and site management and
   maintenance, including site management and defect inspection. The
   results also showed that the application of AR technology in the
   construction industry can align and address building industry objectives
   by various elements such as: reducing project costs through the
   application of digital technologies, saving time, meeting deadlines and
   reduction in project delays through integrated, live scheduling and
   increased safety and quality of the construction work and workers.
   Research limitations/implications One of the main limitations of this
   study was the lack of materials and resources on the downfalls and
   shortcomings of using immersive technologies, AR, in the construction
   project life cycle. In addition, most of the reviewed papers were
   focused on the experiments with simulations and in the lab environment,
   rather than real experiments in real construction sites and projects.
   This may cause limitations and inaccuracy of the collected and reported
   data. Practical implications The results of this study indicated that
   the application of AR technology in construction industry can align and
   address building industry objectives by various elements such as:
   reducing project costs through the application of digital technologies;
   saving time; meeting deadlines and reduction in project delays through
   integrated, live scheduling; and increased safety and quality of the
   construction work and workers.
   Social implications Application of AR in the various stages of a project
   life cycle can increase the safety and quality of the construction work
   and workers.
   Originality/value The reviewed literature indicated that substantial
   research and studies are yet to be done, to demonstrate the full
   capacity and impact of these emerging technologies in the field. The
   collected data and literature indicate that amongst the digital
   technologies, AR is one of the least researched topics in the field.
   Therefore, this study aims to examine the application of AR in
   construction projects' life cycle to identify the stages and practices
   of a project life cycle where AR and its capabilities can be exploited
   and to identify the respective problems and issues of the conventional
   methods and the ways in which AR can address those shortcomings.
   Furthermore, this study focuses on identifying the overall outcome of AR
   applications in a construction project in terms of cost and time
   efficiency, process precision and safety.},

Abstract = {The UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative has been promoting the development
   and dissemination of a life cycle management capability maturity model
   (LCM CMM) to fully operationalize and eventually mainstream LCA into all
   facets of business, including product development, marketing, and
   strategic decision-making business processes. The capability framework
   defines a logical sequence of skill building based on the experiences of
   sustainability leaders that can speed learning for companies with less
   mature programs. Business improvement projects are designed to
   incrementally expand the span of concern from company objectives, to
   value chain viability, and ultimately to societal needs, while
   broadening the base of information and engaging a wider set of
   stakeholder views.
   The UNEP/SETAC sponsored pilot tests of the LCM CMM in Cameroon, Uganda,
   South Africa, India, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The results from the
   pilot conducted by Secretaria Distrital de Ambiente (SDA) and a network
   of 22 companies in Bogota, Colombia, are presented to illustrate how the
   capability approach can be applied and highlight lessons learned to
   promote further dissemination of life cycle practices.
   The companies were able to apply the concepts to develop accurate,
   representative assessments of organizational maturity and to identify
   reasonable improvement projects that delivered some financial value in
   the short term, addressed a management system gap identified in the
   maturity assessment, and could be completed within the schedule deadline
   of the contract (6 to 9 months). The projects included an LCA of
   cleaning products, collaboration among three companies to find a better
   solution for managing a waste stream of coffee ``silver skins,{''} a
   streamlined assessment of acrylic products, an LCA of disposable
   polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) cups, and a qualitative
   screening of operations of a transit company. The paper discusses how
   the results of the studies were used to identify specific improvement
   projects tailored to the specific needs and priorities of each company.
   The pilot projects showed that the capability maturity approach had
   intuitive appeal and the companies were able to apply the concepts to
   their organizations with limited technical support and identify an
   appropriate improvement project with LC relevance. This suggests there
   should be less emphasis on LCA as a tool to identify projects and more
   as a method to gain insights for effective implementation of
   business-relevant projects. One key question is how to sustain the
   energy and ongoing improvements fostered by this pilot program.},

Title = {Advancements and prospects in building information modeling (BIM) for
   construction: a review},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 15},
Abstract = {Purpose - The paper clarifies research gaps and future directions in
   building information modeling (BIM) research by analyzing research
   trends and publication patterns. It aims to (1) systematically
   categorize the vast array of BIM literature into coherent main topics,
   (2) identify the most and least explored areas and (3) propose
   directions for future research based on identified research gaps.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) method to manage large datasets and uncover hidden
   patterns in academic journals and conference articles. To clarify the
   scholarly focus, the main topics in BIM research are categorized into
   three groups: (1) primary areas of focus, (2) moderately explored topics
   and (3) least investigated topics. Findings - The findings revealed 10
   main topics (MTs) and 57 subtopics (STs), identifying key areas such as
   project design and management (20\%), innovative construction technology
   (14\%) and sustainable construction/life cycle management (14\%).
   Conversely, it also highlighted underexplored areas like Facility/safety
   management and urban data development, suitable for future research.
   Research limitations/implications - While this work provides a
   structured overview of the BIM domain, it reveals opportunities for
   further exploring the complexity of the interrelation among
   interdisciplinary topics. Originality/value - The novelty of this study
   is its extensive scope, analyzing over fifteen thousand BIM articles
   from 2013 to 2023, which significantly expands the literature scale
   previously reviewed. This comprehensive approach maps BIM research
   trends and gaps and also shows the hierarchical trend line of
   publications in each main topic, setting a benchmark for future studies.},

Abstract = {The subject of this paper addresses the field of integration and
   interoperability between AEC-FM software applications and construction
   products' data. It has managed to establish a novel concept for a
   solution that links continually updated and extensible life-cycle

   all over the life span of the product itself. It is based on the
   existence of construction product data, side by side in parallel to the
   Building Information Model.
   The work resulted in a flexible and reliable Building Information Model
   that is capable of referencing, retrieving, updating and merging product
   data into Building Information Models at any point in time. A
   distributed network application that represents all involved parties in
   the construction product value and supply chains is simulated by real
   software tools to demonstrate the proof of concept of this work. (C)

Title = {Service life of building envelopes: A critical literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The importance of knowing the service life of buildings and their
   components is recognized. Several studies have been developed, in
   different countries, to address this research topic. In some situations,
   the existing knowledge/ information is easy to understand, but only
   offers absolute and standard values, which do not provide relevant
   information on the real service life of the elements. In real-world
   situations, the decision-makers usually face time-constraints in
   searching for service life data and apply service life values obtained
   from normative guidelines or a limited number of studies. This study
   thus fills an existing gap, identifying and synthesizing the relevant
   research on service life prediction of elements of the building envelope
   (exterior claddings in facades and pitched roofs, and window frames). A
   total of 107 publications are analysed and based on this systematic
   review, a database is created, highlighting the empirical evidence from
   the literature. A critical review is performed, to improve the awareness
   on the best experiences and practices, discussing the variance between
   the worst-case predictions and the real service life of the elements.
   This database can be used by researchers, end-users, or practitioners,
   aiding the creation of theoretical frameworks, to apply the extended
   past research in future projections and aid the management of the
   buildings and components' life cycle.},

Abstract = {With the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution and extensive
   promotion of information communication tools, it is on the construction
   industry to reconsider the current linear design approach and adopt more
   integrated design approaches that encompass dynamic thermal simulation.
   Building information modeling (BIM), without a doubt, is a technology,
   which proposes an integrated practice for building design. Design team
   using BIM cooperatively work on each activity loop during the design
   procedure and present a three-dimensional (3D) design model with all
   data from various disciplines attached at the final stage. The inclusion
   of a data-rich 3D shape into the design procedure marks the dynamic
   thermal simulation as a simple, accessible, and, more importantly,
   decisive stage. This article aims to draw the role of BIM in
   facilitating the inclusion of dynamic thermal simulation in building
   design procedures. BIM in this article is introduced as an effective
   remedy for dealing with the linear nature of conventional building
   design that is the major impediment to the inclusion of dynamic thermal
   simulations in the design efforts. This article goes through the
   conventional method's deficiencies and challenges with the BIM-based
   method to portray each approach's advantages and disadvantages. Renowned
   BIM software, interoperable simulation tools, and their distinguishing
   characteristics are introduced in summary to give a better insight into
   the application of BIM for dynamic thermal simulation purposes.
   Additionally, a literature survey on applying the introduced tools is
   conducted to derive the possible BIM-based mechanisms for thermal
   performance and comfort analysis. This article concludes that,
   regardless of interoperability issues, BIM by coordination of building
   data and information in a consistent framework significantly facilitates
   data collection procedure for conducting dynamic thermal simulations. In
   combination with data collection and interoperable simulation tools, BIM
   tools provide novel mechanisms for dynamic thermal performance and
   comfort analysis.
   Highlights
   Traditional and BIM-based building design procedures have been reviewed.
   The role of iterative simulation in BIM-based simulation has been
   elaborated.
   A BIM-based framework for building design has been provided.
   BIM-based approaches for thermal performance and comfort analysis have
   been reviewed.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a key enabler to support
   integration of building data within the buildings life cycle (BLC) and
   is an important aspect to support a wide range of use cases, related to
   intelligent automation, navigation, energy efficiency, sustainability
   and so forth. Open building data faces several challenges related to
   standardization, data interdependency, data access, and security. In
   addition to these technical challenges, there remains the barrier among
   BIM developers who wish to protect their intellectual property, as full
   3D BIM development requires expertise and effort. This means that there
   is often limited availability of building data. However, a Linked Data
   approach to BIM, combined with a supporting national geospatial
   identifier infrastructure makes interlinking and controlled sharing of
   BIM models possible. In Ireland, the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi)
   maintains a substantial data set, called Prime2, which includes not only
   building GIS data (polygon footprint, geodetic coordinate), but also
   additional building specific data (e.g. form, function and status). The
   data set also includes change information, recording when changes took
   place and who captured and validated those changes. This paper presents
   the development of a national geospatial identifier infrastructure based
   on an OSi building ontology that supports capturing OSi building data
   using Resource Description Framework (RDF). The paper details the
   different steps required to generate the ontology and publish the data.
   First, an initial analysis of the data set to generate the ontology is
   discussed. This includes identification of mappings to existing
   standards, e.g. GeoSPARQL to handle geometries and PROV-O to handle
   provenance, to the development of R2RML mappings to generate the RDF and
   the method for deploying the ontology and the building graphs. This data
   is then made available dependent on different licensing agreements
   handled by an access control approach. Methods are then presented to
   support the interlinking of the authoritative data with other building
   data standards and data sets using geolocation, followed finally by
   discussion and future work.},

Abstract = {The existing regulatory structure for nuclear power plants impacts both
   the design and the operation of the facility {[}1]. The current
   structure has been known to be overly conservative in several instances.
   This overly conservative approach results in operational costs to the
   facility that decrease the profit margin for nuclear power companies.
   The current design and build process also results in expensive
   retrofitting and contributes excess costs to the operations of the
   facility {[}1]. The current fleet of nuclear reactors is composed mainly
   of large light water reactors (LWRs) that can, to some extent,
   counteract these operational costs by the sheer volume of energy
   produced. However, the deliberately small size of small modular reactors
   (SMRs) prevents them from benefitting from this economy of scale. In
   order to be built and operated economically, SMR vendors must find ways
   to bring the life cycle costs in line with the economic requirements of
   nuclear power companies.
   Sandia National Laboratories has developed a framework that allows
   vendors and operators to address many of the operational costs during
   the design and manufacture stages of the SMR life cycle. The framework
   allows certain operational costs to be addressed in the design stages,
   thereby decreasing the operational costs, especially those costs
   associated with staffing and retrofitting. The framework pulls together
   best practices that have been applied successfully in other industries.
   Concurrent Engineering (CE) frames the procedural stages, from defining
   the expectations of the facility deployment, through the identification
   of regulatory requirements, to the pre-conceptual, conceptual and
   detailed design stages. A Project Management Organization is critical to
   the time management and success of implementing CE. The use of
   Integrated Safety, Operations, Security, and Safeguards (ISOSS) will
   lead to achieve a more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable plant.
   The Balance Model is introduced as a tool to document conflicts between
   functional areas and identify balancing strategies for conflict
   resolution in the requirements. Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is
   proposed as a variable for decision making.
   Facility Lifecycle Management with Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   is encouraged to support the Build, Activation, Continued Operations and
   Decommissioning of the facility {[}1].
   To ensure that the deployment of SMR is effective and cost efficient,
   the ideal time to implement the framework is now, before SMR designs
   reach the detailed stage. SMRs hold a lot of potential and this
   framework can help the nuclear industry realize that potential.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of a building-integrated linear

   life-cycle indicators},

Abstract = {Building-integrated concentrating photovoltaic (PV) systems are of great
   interest, offering several advantages for building and environment. The
   present study is an advancement towards the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   of a linear dielectric-based building-integrated concentrating PV system
   by means of multiple life-cycle impact assessment methods and
   environmental indicators (ReCiPe, Eco-indicator 99, ecological
   footprint, USEtox, ReCiPe-based and Eco-indicator-99-based payback times
   (PBT5), etc.), providing a detailed analysis. Two configurations (with
   and without reflective film) are examined, for different cities
   (Barcelona, Exeter and Dublin). By focussing on material manufacturing
   (system with reflective film), in general, ReCiPe
   (endpoint/single-score; points) results are in accordance to
   Ecoindicator 99 (single-score; points) findings and based on both
   methods PVs have the maximum contribution for ecosystems/ecosystem
   quality and human health. Moreover, based on USEtox results, there is a
   remarkable difference between the impact of the PVs and the impact of
   the other components. With regard to the PBT5, taking into account both
   configurations with/without reflective film, Barcelona presents the
   lowest ReCiPe and Eco-indicator-99 PBT5 ranging from 3.6 to 5.8 years.
   On the other hand, Exeter and Dublin show PBTs from 3.7 to 7.8 years.
   According to ReCiPe/endpoint results with characterization, for climate
   change/human health (system with reflective film) Barcelona shows 1.2 x
   10(-7) disability adjusted -life-years per kWh while Dublin and Exeter
   present a footprint of present about 1.8 x 10(-7)
   disability-adjusted-life-years per kWh. Results in terms of
   (species.yr)/kWh are also presented (ReCiPe/endpoint with
   characterization), for several scenarios. Regarding the two
   configurations, the findings based on multiple approaches verify that
   reflective film considerably improves the eco-profile of the reference
   system (configuration without reflective film). For example, by
   utilizing reflective film there is a reduction of ReCiPe-based and
   Eco-indicator-99-based PBT5 ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 years, depending on
   the scenario. Finally, results from the literature are presented along
   with. results of the present study and a critical discussion is
   provided. Conclusively, the proposed LCA model can also be applied to
   similar systems, providing useful information about their environmental
   profile and offering the possibility to select among different
   configurations the best from ecological/cleaner production point of
   view. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is considered to be significant for
   organisational communication in construction projects. However, the role
   of BIM has not been fully shown in practice. To this end, this study
   examined the impact of BIM on communication network from inter- and
   intra- organisational relationships in the construction project. First,
   the structures of the communication networks before and after the use of
   BIM in a project in China were determined based on the social capital
   perspective. Then, the social network analysis was adopted to measure
   the changes in network metrics (i.e., number of ties, density,
   centrality, centralisation, and clique). Results shows that the
   connections among nodes are denser, and all the values of the network
   centralisation decrease after BIM application compared with the
   situation before BIM use. Nevertheless, results also shows that some
   construction project participants, who originally have interaction and
   communication needs, remain unable to establish effective connections
   among one another even after BIM use. Accordingly, some suggestions were
   proposed to solve the issues and deficiencies. This research contributes
   to (a) the state of knowledge by proposing social capital perspective
   that can identify inter- and intra-organizational relationships of the
   construction project from social interaction and common cognition to
   build communication network, and (b) the state of practice by
   identifying conditions and proposing strategies for strengthening
   organisational communication and collaboration in BIM-enabled network
   relationships.},

Abstract = {With the rapid advancement of technology, accurate and reliable
   architectural heritage information is increasingly in demand in the
   fields of cultural heritage and architectural conservation. This study
   aimed to establish a positive and harmonious relationship between
   architectural heritage and urban renewal in China's sustainable
   urbanization process by documenting and conserving Chinese architectural
   heritage information. This work focuses on integrating architectural
   heritage information into multilevel and multi-dimensional information
   using scientific and standardized classification methods for documenting
   and conserving Chinese architectural heritage. The former site of the
   provisional Senate of the Nanjing National Government was studied and
   documented for this purpose. A precise 3D modeling for the components of
   architectural heritage and building information modeling (BIM)
   technology based on the two-dimensional (2D) drawings and component
   information were studied, analyzed, and used for restoration. Finally, a
   component ``family{''} library was created using the common components
   of existing historical buildings. The results showed that the proposed
   method could provide both 3D and 2D drawings directly in the digital
   protection of historical buildings to monitor, repair, and protect
   architectural heritage, particularly historical buildings, throughout
   their life cycle. Overall, this work highlights the importance of
   protecting architectural heritage in sustainable urbanization and
   proposes an effective method for achieving this goal.},

Abstract = {Poverty alleviation by means of rural development has become a priority
   among developing countries. In turn, rural development may be
   significantly enhanced and supported by Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs), the use of which is highlighted by the emerging
   importance of information and knowledge as key strategic resources for
   social and economic development. An analysis of rural case studies where
   ICTs have been introduced, suggests that there are a number of barriers
   and constraints that are faced when taking advantage of these
   technologies. These include access to infrastructure, limited formal
   education, insufficient training and capacity building, financial and
   political constraints, and social and cultural challenges. These
   challenges threaten the success and sustainability of rural ICT
   projects. Sustainability is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT
   project; therefore it is important to understand the concept and
   categories associated with ICT project sustainability in rural areas.
   The categories of sustainability which include social and cultural,
   institutional, economic, political, and technological, reveal critical
   success factors that need to be considered in the implementation and
   management of rural ICT projects.
   The project management discipline acknowledges the importance of
   understanding the project's environment, particularly environmental
   factors associated with rural communities. The complexity of the
   environment requires that a project be undertaken in phases comprising
   the project life cycle. Project management practice for rural ICT
   project sustainability can be examined, adapting the traditional project
   life cycle to a rural ICT project. This paper proposes a Rural ICT
   Project Life Cycle (RICT-PLC) that is sensitive to the critical success
   factors (CSFs) of sustainability. The CSFs contribute to the project
   management practices that should be incorporated into the life cycle
   phases of a rural ICT project. The RICT-PLC model developed sets
   sustainability guidelines for ICT project management in rural areas and
   identifies the people, environments, technologies, systems, and
   requirements for ICTs to support rural development activities.},

Abstract = {Aim of this research is to deliver a system of procedures and
   instruments that allows comparing different scenarios of restoration and
   retrofit of existing buildings applicable each time a relevant decision
   about the asset has to be made. The system developed takes advantages of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Analytical Hierarchy Process
   (AHP), thus to focus on main clients' needs. Decisions about real estate
   assets are frequently made by managers with incomplete and scattered
   data, not sufficient to fully support the decision making process. Using
   a BIM model as a central repository of information could strongly
   support to compare objectively different scenarios and consequently to
   decide the application of a multi-criteria matrix involving management,
   energy, economic and social issues. BIM and BEM (Building Energy
   Modelling) techniques have a wide potential and analysis capabilities;
   however, they are often adopted without an integrated framework, causing
   missing performances and costs overrun. The result is a system enabling
   to analyze the asset, to produce BIM and BEM models ready to include
   life cycle data, to evaluate feasible alternatives and scenarios and to
   extract relevant performance indicators for decision makers' support. An
   existing office building in Milan representing an awkward field for
   intervention is the case study for the system application. While the
   tools and software adopted are commonly used, the system of procedures
   developed by the authors can be considered as an ensemble of workflows
   otherwise typically used independently. Using them together enhance the
   decision process providing data on which to set up a strategic plan of
   the refurbishment considering costs, continuity in occupancy and energy
   efficiency. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {The colors of heath flowering - quantifying spatial patterns of

Abstract = {Recent developments in high-resolution ecosystem mapping using unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAV) open up promising perspectives for the monitoring
   of fine-scale vegetation patterns and ecological functioning. In this
   study, we examine the potential of UAV imagery to track the structural
   composition and related phenological traits of the dwarf shrub Calluna
   vulgaris on a former military training area. On a European Natura 2000
   heathland site, habitat management is shown to be evaluated on the basis
   of flowering dynamics and reproductive recovery as a proxy of functional
   changes that are generated after fire destruction. In particular, we
   utilize true color camera information and digital surface models to
   determine the spatiotemporal evolution of Calluna life-cycle phases and
   flowering phenology 2 years after controlled burning. A stepwise
   methodological framework is presented that extracts Calluna pixels,
   spatially separates juvenile and mature life-cycle phases,
   differentiates between generative and vegetative shoot extension and
   finally quantifies proportions of flowers, fruits and vegetative growth
   in two consecutive peak flowering periods. We show that Calluna
   life-cycle phases can be spatially differentiated in pioneer, building
   and mature phases in UAV imagery. In the juvenile phase, regeneration
   from germination is low (<10\%) and sprouting from the stem base
   dominates recovery patterns after fire management. The study further
   reveals that the distribution of flowering and fruiting during peak
   flowering time is spatially heterogeneous with high variations between
   years. In the fire unaffected mature phase, proportions of flowers and
   fruits are reduced indicating a decrease in reproductive capacity of
   unmanaged Calluna stands. A phenological phase shift is detected from
   flowering to fruiting that is related to an increase of Calluna growth
   height. The study shows that the functional patterns of growth and
   reproduction can be mapped for heathland ecosystems using simple true
   color drone cameras.},

Title = {Consequential LCA modelling of building refurbishment in New Zealand- an
   evaluation of resource and waste management scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {119-133},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Large scale building refurbishments are likely to become more common in
   New Zealand's building sector, and therefore it is relevant to assess
   the environmental impacts associated with these activities. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the environmental impacts arising from the
   increase in demand for building refurbishments in New Zealand using
   consequential Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The study focused on the
   identification of resource constraints and marginal suppliers of
   construction materials using market information specific to New Zealand.
   Building refurbishment strategies related to waste minimization at
   construction sites and use of recycled materials at production sites
   were compared. According to the results, increasing the rates of
   construction waste recovery and re-use at site can reduce the overall
   environmental impact of a building refurbishment by 15-25\% compared to
   use of construction materials with recycled content which only reduces
   the environmental impacts by approximately 5\%. The net impact results
   were sensitive to the quality of recyclable material, location of the
   marginal supplier and marginal energy source. The study recommends
   stakeholders involved during early building design to focus on material
   sourcing and quality; and practical solutions to increase material
   recoverability at site e.g. planning for efficient on-site management
   for waste disaggregation, recovery and re-use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Implementation of an Automated Code Checking Algorithm Based on Site
   Analysis},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To date, BIM has been primarily utilized in cost and schedule
   management, an interference check between architectural and structural
   models and systems based on geometric data in the process of the
   construction life cycle. However, there is a lack of research that
   utilizes the information contained in the BIM model to review whether
   the proposed architectural model is appropriately designed in accordance
   with each country's building regulations or building codes or that
   proposes a model optimized for laws and standards. `Building code
   checking' is the step of reviewing whether a building designed based on
   the building codes is suitable for being constructed as a building.
   However, this process consumes significant time and money and leads to
   human errors due to the manual review process. This study included
   implementation of an algorithm based on the Korean building code. In
   this study, there was the process of selection of codes when architects
   interpret building codes in common and implementation based on the codes
   selected. Next, modeling based on DXF files from NGII (National
   Geographic Information Institute) was applied to the algorithm developed
   in this study. Last, it includes case studies that compare the outputs
   of the algorithm with the real buildings, which had received real code
   checking, to make sure the algorithm in this paper is working properly.
   The implementation of such an automated system has the potential to
   significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the building
   design and construction process. It can help architects to quickly and
   accurately identify potential legal issues and provide alternative
   solutions that meet regulatory requirements. This, in turn, can lead to
   reduced project costs, improved quality of designs, and faster project
   delivery times.},

Title = {Integration of building information modeling into building circularity
   assessment: a systematic review},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 30},
Abstract = {Purpose - Despite several attempts to integrate building information
   modeling (BIM) with building circularity assessment (BCA), no systematic
   review has yet been carried out on this topic to the best knowledge of
   the authors. The objective of this review is to fill this gap by
   reviewing the current attempts, identifying the tools and exploring the
   state-of-the-art in BIM and BCA. Design/methodology/approach - A
   systematic literature review (SLR) methodology was employed. A total of
   30 documents published between 2015 and 2023 were selected and analyzed
   across the concept, methodology and value dimensions. Findings - There
   has been an increase in the development of BIM-based BCA tools in recent
   years, with the Netherlands taking the lead. Most tools developed were
   based on the material circularity indicator (MCI) and by using Autodesk
   Revit as BIM software. Three integration approaches for BIM with BCA
   were identified: (1) using an external platform; (2) linking an external
   database to BIM and (3) within the BIM environment. The review has
   revealed that still there is no standard for BCA, and interoperability
   and lack of circularity databases are the major challenges. Research
   limitations/implications - Although the paper has made contributions, it
   is important to recognize certain limitations. One of these is the
   inability to explore all the tools in depth as some of them are not
   available or accessible. Another limitation is the relatively small
   number of studies that were reviewed, primarily because there is a lack
   of research in this area due to the BIM-based BCA is still in its
   infancy compared to the BIM-based LCA. Originality/value - This study
   contributes to providing a comprehensive up-to-date overview of recent
   advancements in BIM-BCA integration, as well as a framework for
   understanding its concept, methodology and value dimensions. It also
   highlights significant areas where practitioners and researchers can
   identify knowledge gaps and future research directions.},

Title = {Optimizing Energy Use, Cost and Carbon Emission through Building
   Information Modelling and a Sustainability Approach: A Case-Study of a
   Hospital Building},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The construction industry (CI) has a significant impact on the
   environment and on climate change due to the emission of greenhouse
   gases like carbon dioxide. Globally accepted Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDG), specifically SDG 7 (Access to Affordable, Reliable,
   Sustainable and Modern Energy for All), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and
   Infrastructure), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) stress
   the responsible utilization of energy in various industries, including
   construction. The CI uses almost half of the world's produced energy.
   Therefore, this research presents insights into the efficient use of
   energy in the building sector and shows how energy efficiency can be
   achieved by altering different parameters and components like
   orientation, materials, glazing, and HVAC systems through a case study
   of a hospital building in Green Building Studio (GBS). This paper also
   aims to use the Building Information Modelling (BIM) approach to make
   environmentally sustainable decisions to reduce energy waste in
   projects. Initially, beneficial factors of BIM on green buildings were
   identified in the literature and later ranked, based on expert opinions
   collected using a set of questionnaires. Average Index was used for data
   analysis. The identified benefits were validated by conducting energy
   analyses on a hospital model through 3D BIM. It was concluded that a
   substantial share of energy cost, carbon dioxide (CO2), and electricity
   can be saved using this approach. It was determined that a quick and
   sustainable design process, improved energy efficiency, enhanced
   building performance, and provision of better design alternatives are
   the key benefits of the adoption of BIM by such projects. A Cronbach's
   alpha value of 0.822 was obtained, which further validates the results.
   The proposed approach may lead future structures to be sustainable and
   enriches the culture of energy-efficient green buildings.},

Abstract = {The potential of concurrent engineering in the integration of the
   construction industry is now widely acknowledged. This paper describes
   research on the development of a model for processing client
   requirements so as to facilitate the implementation of an integrated
   framework far concurrent life-cycle design and construction. Client
   requirements processing involves the definition, analysis and
   translation of client requirements Into solution-neutral design
   specifications. The development of a model for accomplishing this
   involved the use of both primary and secondary sources of information,
   and techniques such as Quality Function Deployment, to define the need,
   context, framework, and procedure far client requirements processing in
   concurrent life-cycle design and construction. The functional and
   informational/data perspectives of the model, which were represented
   using the IDEF-0 and EXPRESS-G modelling methods, respectively, provided
   the basis for developing a prototype software (ClientPro) within
   Microsoft Access. This prototype was evaluated by practitioners from the
   construction industry following a demonstration using the requirements
   for a building project. It is concluded that the client requirements
   processing model represents a unique and innovative approach in which
   Quality Function Deployment and other tools were successfully combined
   and adapted to facilitate the systematic definition, analysis. and
   mapping of client requirements to design specifications in construction.
   it not only contributes to the implementation of concurrent engineering
   in construction, but it represents an improved alternative to the
   existing process of briefing.},

Title = {TOWARDS AN IMPROVED FRAMEWORK FOR ENTERPRISE BIM: THE ROLE OF ISO 19650},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {1075-1103},
Abstract = {Enterprise BIM aims to optimise business management and asset management
   throughout the life -cycle of buildings and infrastructures. This
   follow-up study of the Enterprise BIM concept analyses the potential for
   international standardisation, mainly focusing on the contribution of
   the ISO 19650 standard series to further development. The study explores
   how key ISO 19650 concepts related to different types of information
   requirements, levels of information need, and common data environments
   can help strengthen Enterprise BIM. As such, the paper presents an
   in-depth analysis of how the ISO 19650 series and several adjacent
   standards can provide a further means of facilitating information
   management within the Enterprise BIM concept. The study uses a
   customised Zachman framework by adding the necessary perspectives from
   ISO 19650 and Enterprise BIM. The paper adds increased knowledge related
   to understanding the standard series parts 1, 2 and 3 and showing how
   they can be implemented in an enterprise structure. Based on the ISO
   19650 framework, the study emphasises the importance of linking the
   information requirements to the various information needs of multiple
   end-users. At the same time, the paper provides new knowledge by showing
   that the information flow in the operational phase is far more nuanced
   than in the delivery phase, suggesting that information management must
   be considered in a completely different light from what previous
   research shows.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has increased in recent
   years, mostly due to the potential of the methodology for improving
   construction project performance and efficiency. With a view to
   achieving a better understanding of the research work on this subject,
   this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis and a review of existing
   literature on BIM focusing on the last decade. The authors selected the
   articles published in journals with an impact factor higher then 1.0, as
   well as the top 100 most cited articles. The search resulted on 381
   articles, which were then categorised in order to systematise the
   research conducted over the years. The authors have not only analysed
   the existing literature but also highlighted new emerging fields in BIM
   research, being possible to identify Collaborative Environments and
   Interoperability, Sustainable Construction, BIM Adoption \&
   Standardisation, and BIM Programming as the categories with the most
   significant growth in the last years. It was also observed that the most
   researched topics were related with the development of BIM tools, the
   study of BIM adoption worldwide, the energy simulation using BIM-based
   information and, more recently, with the semantic interoperability and
   ontology. On the other hand, the study on BIM at the academic level is
   very small, as well as parametric modelling and quantity take-off. (C)

Abstract = {The Building Industry (BI) lacks in sharing information among different
   and heterogeneous stakeholders. With the advent of new technologies such
   as mobile devices, IoT and Industry 4.0 different approaches have been
   introduced, but it is still an open research field. The present essay
   aims at moving a step forward using augmented reality connected with the
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology enhancing the
   effectiveness of process in the BI.
   The authors improved the Fraunhofer Italia's AR4Construction (AR4C)
   mobile application, that lets construction workers visualize the BIM
   model of a building on site in augmented reality and interact with its
   design information. The main purpose of this study consists in studying
   and developing an indoor location functionality for the AR4C
   application. The research focuses on understanding the starting point
   and the orientation of the user, through the application of 3D
   mathematical structures and computer vision methods.
   The result is a core module for an indoor location functionality. We
   have evaluated distances and orientation errors, analyzing the results
   according to the implementation strategy. In conclusion, possible
   improvements have been analyzed within this paper, which offers a first
   approach for visualization-only based frameworks aiming at indoor
   location and navigation and using BIM models as a starting point.},

Abstract = {Paper-based data acquisition and manual transfer between incompatible
   software or data formats during inspections of bridges, as done
   currently, are time-consuming, error-prone, cumbersome, and lead to
   information loss. A fully digitized workflow using open data formats
   would reduce data loss, efforts, and the costs of future inspections. On
   the one hand, existing studies proposed methods to automatize data
   acquisition and visualization for inspections. These studies lack an
   open standard to make the gathered data available for other processes.
   On the other hand, several studies discuss data structures for
   exchanging damage information among different stakeholders. However,
   those studies do not cover the process of automatic data acquisition and
   transfer. This study focuses on a framework that incorporates automatic
   damage data acquisition, transfer, and a damage information model for
   data exchange. This enables inspectors to use damage data for subsequent
   analyses and simulations. The proposed framework shows the potentials
   for a comprehensive damage information model and related
   (semi-)automatic data acquisition and processing.},

   the system analysis apparatus. There is a developed typical scheme of
   product life cycle steps and stages for engineering products. In order
   to reveal an information exchange and decision-making mechanism in an
   automated system of product quality management, its set-theoretical
   model was developed. The author considers the structures of input and
   output data for each operator subsystem. There are the principles
   defining the methodology of creating industrial quality management
   systems. Their implementation will allow developing sufficiently

Title = {The role of interoperability dimensions in building information
   modelling},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a paradigm shift from the
   traditional Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry
   practices to digital construction delivery processes. BIM provides the
   capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity,
   and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its
   adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is
   often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited
   focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas,
   such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of
   interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability.
   These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC
   industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM
   Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate
   the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European
   Interoperability framework and develop BIM Inter operability Model with
   factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a
   comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and
   legal interoperability in intra -organizational AEC units,
   inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a
   model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity
   interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the
   organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the
   interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM
   model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations
   and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by
   improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes,
   and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future
   research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing
   these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project
   delivery well informed, more structured, and effective.

Abstract = {Maintenance is considered a key issue in hypermedia systems. Common
   sense indicates that it might be possible to understand the web's
   content without any knowledge representation, but not to automatically
   manage and support it. Assuming that the development and maintenance of
   hypermedia systems is dynamic and evolutionary, this implies a
   continuous process of change throughout their life cycles. Here, we
   review a conceptual hypermedia system model, the Semantic and
   Evolutionary Model for HyPermedia systems, to maintain its consistency
   during its life cycle. This model makes a semantic representation of the
   information system, offering an architecture whose components are
   formally defined by using the underlying semantics. In this article, we
   focus on formalizing the building of hypermedia information systems. To
   do so, we propose a novel axiomatic approach based on the graph theory
   that ensures their consistency. The major objective of this contribution
   is to describe a computational and mathematical proof that determines
   the set of axioms that are valid to keep the integrity of the
   information system. These axioms are able to generate the combinations
   that are valid by means of logical deduction.},

Title = {Embodied greenhouse gas assessment of a bridge: A comparison of
   preconstruction Building Information Model and construction records},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {295},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents an embodied GHG assessment of a completed highway
   bridge renewal project in Canada and offers new insights on the
   strengths and limitations of BIM-based GHG assessments. Bridges play a
   critical role in transportation infrastructure. As reducing
   environmental impacts has taken on increasing urgency across the
   construction sector, bridges have received relatively little study. A
   quantitative understanding of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions
   (GHG) in bridges is needed to inform future infrastructure planning,
   design, and construction. Recent efforts to streamline environmental
   assessment in construction have led to the creation and adoption of
   Building Information Model (BIM) based embodied GHG assessments, taking
   advantage of the quantity take-off functionality of BIM. However, as
   BIMs are rarely developed with environmental assessment as the primary
   goal, their effectiveness for GHG accounting can be limited. GHG
   assessments of the case study bridge using a BIM prepared before
   construction and using material and energy quantities records collected
   on-site during construction, are compared. Using only the quantities
   from preconstruction BIM, the embodied GHG for the case study bridge is
   1.3 x 10(6) kgCO(2)e. After the adjustments for on-site data collection
   and factors commonly excluded from BIM, such as on-site fuel use from
   machinery, it rises to 4.06 x 10(6) kgCO(2)e, an increase of 212\%.
   Results illustrate the need to change the scope and detail of BIMs if
   they are to be effective for embodied GHG assessment, and the potential
   limitations of using BIM in embodied GHG assessment. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Assessing the climate effects of clinker production: A statistical
   analysis to reduce its environmental impacts},
Journal = {CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building materials and components account for about 10\% of the world's
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Carbonate decomposition and fuel
   combustion from the cement production process are responsible for almost
   7\% of carbon dioxide emissions. Since clinker is the most impacting
   component of ordinary Portland cement, this paper presents a statistical
   analysis of the life cycle impacts of 41 recipes of grey clinker
   produced in Europe from 2015 to 2023 to identify the consumption impact
   categories (e.g., fossil fuels, renewable and nonrenewable secondary
   fuels) which better explain the assessment of the Global Warming
   Potential (GWP), typically exploited to quantify the environmental
   impact of clinker production. More in detail, several regression methods
   are applied to the available dataset to build predictive models for GWP
   and to determine the most relevant impact categories. The regression
   models are then compared with respect to their statistical accuracy and
   goodness of fit. The results provide information that can support cement
   producers in developing lowimpacting cement recipes.},

Abstract = {Regarding the classical workflow in civil engineering, the
   responsibilities between geotechnical engineers, the client and other
   project partners like technical planners and construction companies are
   clearly defined and well established. In infrastructure construction,
   however, it will be prospectively obligatory that the geotechnical
   expert delivers a specialized model subsoil in addition to the
   geotechnical report. As this specialized model subsoil needs to be
   directly interconnected with other specialized models to build up the
   overall BIM model, the geotechnical expert will most likely be deeper
   embedded in the planning and construction process over the whole project
   life cycle. Furthermore, due to the need of standardization in the BIM
   process and the need to develop a suitable model structure for all
   specialized models, the client will also gain further responsibilities
   compared to the classical planning process. As an example, the clients
   have to define a clear and explicit model structure for the
   geotechnically related specialized models, too. This leads to an
   expansion as well as adaption of responsibilities throughout the project
   handling. Within this fourth recommendation of the DGGT working group
   2.14 ``digitalization in geotechnical engineering{''} the existing
   organizational structures within BIM projects are described and the
   responsibilities are defined focusing on the development of the
   specialized model subsoil.},

Abstract = {In recent years, great development in sensor technologies have resulted
   in substantial progress in the construction efficiency and the degree of
   automation of construction machinery have made great progress.
   Applications of the sensor technologies, such as condition monitoring,
   autonomous construction and the Internet of Things (IoT), have been
   extensively studied for construction machinery. Firstly, this paper
   discusses the condition monitoring technology in construction machinery,
   which mainly involves the monitoring of oil pollution and leakage,
   vibration monitoring, emission monitoring and whole-system monitoring.
   Second, regarding autonomous construction technology, this paper
   conducts analysis and discussion on linear motion, rotary motion,
   navigation/positioning systems, and visual systems. Third, research on
   IoT technology in construction machinery is comprehensively discussed,
   especially in term of life cycle maintenance, construction management
   and safety management. Finally, higher reliability, the development of
   smart sensors and big data management of sensor information are
   described as prospective issues that must be addressed for future
   construction machinery.},

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {8-9, SI},
Pages = {531-552},
Abstract = {Supply chain management (SCM) and building information modelling (BIM)
   are innovations that focus on integration. Recent literature suggests
   performance benefits from combining these innovations. Within supply
   chain (SC) partnerships, that use BIM-hereinafter called BIM-enabled SC
   partnerships-various formal and informal dimensions influence the
   inter-organizational relations. To understand such partnerships, a mixed
   method approach featuring case studies and social networks analysis
   (SNA) was deployed. SNA was an analytic approach to explore the complex
   relations within two Dutch BIM-enabled projects. The
   inter-organizational relations were asymmetrical and formal in Case A,
   emphasizing transactions, whereas in Case B, they were asymmetrical and
   informal, emphasizing relations. The transactional-oriented partnership
   had greater control over contractual issues, but their formal relations
   were not sufficient for diffusing BIM-related knowledge across the
   chain. Conversely, the relational-oriented partnership engaged the
   partners in BIM by informal means, e.g. dense communication and
   BIM-related peer-learning across all tiers. Symmetric and jointly
   fostered formal and informal relations contribute to SC integration. The
   study extends the knowledge base of SCM and BIM, by offering real-world
   data on their combination. Besides providing new insights into SNA
   deployment for BIM-related research, it also offers a novel
   constructivist and inter-organizational perspective on the old concept
   of SCM.},

Title = {Improving BIM asset and facilities management processes: A Mechanical
   and Electrical (M\&E) contractor perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite BIM asset information management processes having advanced to
   globally recognised standards, facilities and asset integration remains
   problematic for many companies engaged in the construction project
   lifecycle. Challenges typically stem from deficiencies in the BIM
   regulations and standards, inaccurate information exchanges, software
   interoperability issues and unclear requirement definitions that
   ultimately result in higher project costs and poorer operational
   efficiencies. An exploration of these challenges and their potential
   solutions is therefore important if BIM-FM integration issues are to be
   improved. Few studies have systematically investigated this subject from
   the perspective of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and Electrical (M\&E)
   company engaged on projects. This paper combines a literature review
   with an empirical case study of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and
   Electrical (M\&E) contractor to explore the critical issues surrounding
   facilities and asset management integration; this combination of
   evidence providing a distillation of the issues surrounding BIM/FM asset
   integration and its' resolution. 15 key issues from the literature were
   classified under 4 broad themes (Informational, Technological,
   Organisational and Industrial) as being of primary concern; the case
   study analysis verifying the findings and also providing a series of
   bespoke recommendations for improving industry practice. The paper
   clarifies the problem issues (both negotiable and systemic) afflicting
   the industry, indicating how individual companies can develop their own
   processes for improving BIM-based asset integration. It may be concluded
   that although BIM asset integration processes have reached globally
   recognised standards, systemic characteristics of the industry result in
   persisting problems that impact the BIM-FM asset management journey.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how modeling information flows in the design
   process may be used to evaluate design solutions when seeking to reduce
   construction waste in high rise residential buildings. A survey of
   practicing designers identified a number of possible ways to reduce
   construction waste. The most advantageous solutions were based on
   pre-casting and pre- fabrication. Reviewing three of these solutions
   using information modeling techniques shows the changes in the design
   process required to accommodate the different design solutions. This
   method presents an effective basis for reviewing the impact of design
   decisions on the design process. To reduce construction waste demands an
   understanding of the impact of decisions on the level of waste produced,
   a full understanding of the implications throughout the `waste-chain',
   consideration of the lifecycle impact, life-cycle costs and the impact
   of design decisions upon the overall construction process. Additional
   tools and techniques are required to fully meet the needs of designers.

Title = {Environmental impacts of Design for Reuse practices in the building
   sector},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {349},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Actors of the construction sector are facing the challenge of reducing
   their carbon footprint and ideally reaching carbon neutrality. Reuse of
   structural elements made of concrete is of particular interest, given
   the large use of this material worldwide and its high environmental
   impact. Reusing constructive concrete elements is however challenging,
   particularly because connections between concrete structural elements
   are difficult to disassemble. It is then worth designing reuse
   techniques for concrete load-bearing elements and to verify their
   environmental performance using comprehensive methods such as Life Cycle
   Assessment. Based on the Design for Reuse concept, this article assesses
   the environmental impacts of a reusable structural portal frame
   constitutive of a concrete building and compares it to a traditional
   design with new materials. It relies on data collected through an
   experimental protocol of reinforced concrete structures
   construction/deconstruction/reconstruction using hydrodemolition. Impact
   scores are significantly reduced for all environmental categories after
   a first reuse cycle, both at the scale of a portal frame or a building.
   Concrete, and particularly high performance concrete, has durability
   qualities allowing to undergo several usage cycles. The effectiveness of
   environmental benefits however depends on functional downgrading and
   material losses. Guidance should then be provided to insure that future
   reuse practices will actually provide the expected benefits. This has to
   be conducted in parallel to full-scale experiments of load-bearing
   elements disassembly to estimate the realistic rates that can be
   obtained when deconstructing a building.},

Title = {Optimising LCA in complex buildings with MLCAQ: A BIM-based methodology
   for automated multi-criteria materials selection},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {294},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Recent scientific studies have highlighted the importance of integrating
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the construction industry to achieve the
   future sustainable plans. At the moment, most of existing LCA
   methodol-ogies have failed to automate the calculation process, causing
   delays in the decision-making and design phases. Moreover, the
   complexity of buildings poses significant challenges to the calculation.
   To address this, the authors developed the MLCAQ, a streamlined
   methodology designed to compare different material alternatives based on
   the environmental and economic cost impact and guide the early design
   stages. To implement the methodology, the study presents the development
   of a BIM-based software and validates its application in a high-rise
   building. The research compares multi-dimensions of two sets of
   construction materials, analysing the total economic cost, CO2
   emissions, embodied energy and waste mass. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness, replicability, con-sistency and viability of the tool.
   The data generated from the system indicates that using circular
   materials results in a significant reduction in embodied energy
   (26.40\%), CO2 emissions (24.55\%) and waste mass (49.19\%), as well as
   a net reduction of euro7.6 million in total economic cost. The research
   contributes to the integration of multi-dimensional real-time assessment
   into the building design process.},

Abstract = {In the last twenty years, the exploitation of non-renewable resources
   and the effects of their applications on environment and human health
   were considered central topics in political and scientific debate on
   European and worldwide scale. This kind of resources have been used in
   different sectors, as energy systems, technological research, but also
   in private/public buildings and production of consumer goods, involving
   significantly domestic and ordinary life of every human being. Studies
   about the effect of this exploitation carried out discouraging results,
   in terms of climate changes and energy sustenance; this determined a
   progressive approach process to a new concept of development, able to
   couple the qualitative standard of modern life with the respect of
   planet and its inhabitants. Starting from this reflection, scientific
   community moved towards research on alternative resources and developed
   a new way to conceive planning process and technical innovations, in
   order to exploit renewable energies and recycled materials, promote
   energy savings and reduce environmental pollution.
   In this context the present paper aims at evaluating benefits relating
   to different solutions of thermal insulation in building envelope. In
   fact a high grade of insulation ensures better comfort conditions in
   inner spaces, reducing energy consumptions due to heating and cooling
   conditioning. The paper presents the results of a detailed Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) of the reflective foil ISOLIVING, conceived and
   produced by an Italian company.
   The Life Cycle Assessment methodology allows to consider all stages of
   the life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to the product's
   disposal, in an optics ``from cradle to grave{''}. In particular, the
   study takes into account the production phase of the reflective foil
   ISOLIVING, the installation phase, the transport of all components to
   the production site and also the end of life scenario of the material.
   The possibility to collect many detailed information about the
   production phase adds value to the study.
   The analysis is carried out according to UNI EN ISO 14040 and UNI EN ISO
   14044, which regulate the LCA procedure. The LCA modeling was performed
   using SimaPro software application.
   The results of the analysis allow to make an important comparison
   concerning the environmental performances, between the reflective foil
   ISOLIVING and other types of insulating materials.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the huge destruction that has taken place in some
   cities of Iraq due to the terrorist acts in recent years that led to the
   destruction of many buildings. It examines some of the factors that
   encourage the use of residues of these buildings in reconstruction
   processes, especially the sustainability factor, so that some residues
   of these buildings can be used as substitutes for natural building
   materials and find a difference in terms of energy consumption in the
   case of using natural building materials and again in the case of using
   the proposed alternatives. In this study, three alternatives were used:
   10\% recycled fine aggregates (RFA), 100\% RFA, and crushed clay brick
   aggregate (CCBA) to produce recycled coarse aggregates. The results
   obtained through the use of building information modeling (BIM)
   technology were compared with the actual consumption of the building in
   the case of reconstruction using natural building materials. The
   simulation results were comparable to real data. They were analyzed in
   terms of the energy consumption life cycle and annual carbon emissions
   for each alternative. The best alternative was selected from the results
   obtained from BIM. The best alternative was found in the use of CCBA in
   the production of concrete roofs and floors. His final model is that the
   energy consumption was five times lower than the original unit, while
   the results of carbon emissions were equal as for the electricity
   consumption decreased from 23,500 kW/h to less than 23,000 kW/h.},

Abstract = {The building industry consumes a large amount of nature resources and
   generates significant environment impacts around the world. To mitigate
   the resource consumption and associated environmental impacts,
   prefabricated building and construction has been proven to be one of the
   solutions. Several studies have been published in the past decade to
   explore the potential environmental benefits of prefabrication. However,
   a systematic and holistic review in the context of environmental impacts
   of prefabrication is still lacking.
   The research aims to reveal state-of-the-art and identify the research
   trends regarding environmental performance of prefabricated building and
   construction. To do so, a 4-stage literature retrieval and integrated
   analysis framework is designed to efficiently capture and examine the
   subject of interest. The results revealed that the most focused research
   subjects in this field are environmental and energy performances
   assessment, and carbon and energy are most used metrics to evaluate
   these performances. Almost all reviewed research demonstrated that
   prefabrication was better than conventional building on environmental
   performance. Nevertheless, the most frequently used assessment method is
   process based life cycle assessment developed from previous conventional
   building analysis, which may not be the proper method for prefabrication
   building. Operation, maintenance, and demolition obtain less study
   attention and it may worsen the final decision. Present data source that
   usually based on other research may invalid the final results. The
   revealed trends and gaps can serve as in-depth information and
   motivation for researchers to make further progress in prefabricated
   building study.},

Title = {Critical Strategies for Enhancing BIM Implementation in AEC Projects:
   Perspectives from Chinese Practitioners},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The production of the architecture engineering and construction (AEC)
   industry is organized by projects. With the diffusion of information and
   communication technology in the industry, building information modeling
   (BIM) is widely adopted in AEC projects. However, the systematic
   implementation of BIM in AEC projects experiences challenges. This study
   aims to identify critical strategies for enhancing BIM implementation
   within the AEC project context. Initially, 17 strategies are drawn from
   a comprehensive review of the relevant literature. Through a
   questionnaire survey with 116 effective responses from the
   practitioners, ten critical strategies are identified, with the top five
   being clearly defined plans and objectives for BIM implementation,
   financial support, capabilities and skills in BIM technology,
   availability and interoperability of engineering information and data,
   and the aligned objective of BIM implementation with the project goal.
   The study also investigates the possible discrepancy in the different
   actors' assessments on the criticality of the strategies to validate the
   survey. The further principal component analysis groups the strategies
   and finds five latent factors of the strategies, including institutional
   governance, change accommodation, technical environment, cooperation,
   and resources. This finding reveals that systematic BIM implementation
   is inevitably associated with the AEC project context and indicates that
   the enhancement of current BIM implementation in projects covers the
   strategies of the technical, institutional, and managerial aspects to
   accommodate changes brought by BIM. An international comparison of the
   top drivers with the found peer studies from Nigeria, Singapore, and
   Turkey classifies leadership as a driving force to incorporate BIM into
   the AEC projects. The results provide implications for enhancing BIM
   implementation in AEC projects and may help improve the efficiency of
   the industry. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Coupling big data and life cycle assessment: A review, recommendations,
   and prospects},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method that focuses on measuring
   indicators and making decisions in the environmental dimension. However,
   its isolation from economic, social, and other dimensions is difficult
   to identify the interconnections and interactions between
   multidimensions; its global and static perspectives fail to capture
   details of spatiotemporal variations effectively. These challenges limit
   the application of LCA for actual complex systems with multidimensional
   interweaving and high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This necessitates an
   approach that can well quantify multidimensional links and
   spatiotemporal variations to close the gap. To this end, we reviewed
   approximately 150 papers recorded in Web of Science and Scopus databases
   to present the progress in the integration of LCA with different
   dimensions, and the development of dynamic and spatialized LCAs, as well
   as identify key challenges. Based on the literature review, we
   introduced the implications of big data (BD) for LCA to explore a theory
   for the coupling of BD and LCA. We specifically proposed a universal
   methodological framework of big life cycle analysis (BigLCA), including
   four practices: (1) building a spatiotemporal reference system to
   represent the study object, (2) developing a spatiotemporal inventory
   analysis scheme based on a modified multi-flow and multi-node model to
   calculate and integrate massive data, (3) introducing and combining a
   multi-layer indicator system and system dynamics model to quantify
   multidimensional indicators and identify their links, and (4) providing
   spatiotemporal contribution analysis and iterative sensitivity analysis
   schemes for scientific interpretation. The approach and framework can
   facilitate the understanding and discussions of the use of BD in LCA,
   which provides a new approach to improve the accuracy of indicator
   measurement and the effectiveness and applicability of decision-making.},

Abstract = {Today's building practice has led to a lot of premature failure and lack
   of durability, which can cause serious safety, serviceability and
   functional problems. Traditionally design for durability has been
   performed in an empirical, often unstructured manner based upon implicit
   durability requirements. A new approach, which ensures that materials
   and components are suitable and will perform satisfactorily during the
   intended life, is necessary. Service life estimations are complex and
   information intensive. In spite of scientific imperfections and lack of
   information on right format, there is a need for the practical engineer
   to start using the accessible knowledge. The suggested framework for
   service life based design, construction and management of building
   assemblies will ensure that performance requirements are fulfilled
   during the design life, allows optimisation of the whole life cost of
   buildings and permits life cycle assessments. The service life influence
   in different phases, from client's brief till demolition or major
   refurbishment, can be assessed iri five consecutive stages; conceptual
   design, modelling and prediction, engineering stage, construction and in
   service period. The target design life must be determined in an early
   design stage and will serve as a basis for materials selection, detailed
   design, execution procedures and maintenance strategy. After predesign
   the gradual deterioration induced by the interaction between alternative
   materials and the actual surrounding environment can be estimated.
   Different approaches can be used for predicting the future behaviour.
   Models must be based upon a clear phenomenological understanding of the
   degradation process. In the engineering stage materials selection,
   detailed design and a quantitative description of products and
   procedures are executed. In the construction period key factors for
   durability will be quality assurance of solutions and execution
   procedures including environmental control. The degradation process and
   thereby the obtainable service life in terms of performance can in the
   service period be controlled through adequate operation-. inspection-,
   maintenance- and repair activities.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the major concerns worldwide and greenhouse gas
   emissions plays an important role in increasing the temperature of the
   earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, the construction industry is one of
   that presents a considerable environmental impact as it consumes large
   amounts of natural resources and energy. Aiming to investigate the
   environmental impacts, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology evaluates
   products and services showing the similarities and differences in
   evaluating midpoint and endpoint impact categories. This study reviews
   LCA from a building perspective and empowers the decision-making process
   and sustainable building design in the construction sector. The novelty
   is to estimate the operating energy performance and evaluate the
   endpoint impacts of building materials at an early designing stage,
   considering two methods of construction; concrete construction and steel
   construction. This work follows the methodological framework of LCA
   based on ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines within the available database,
   using Autodesk Green Building Studio application in Autodesk Revit and
   Open LCA software based on two assessment methods: IMPACT 2002+ and ILCD
   2011. A case study of a multi-story office building is applied to
   achieve the objectives of this work. The building is structured at four
   levels of subsystems and associated construction materials: basic
   structure, walls, finishing, and windows. Results indicate that using
   steel construction instead of concrete construction is more
   environmentally friendly in such types of buildings. It encourages the
   application of innovative techniques in the production process to
   protect natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and protecting the
   built environment.},

Abstract = {The benefits and barriers of implementing building information modeling
   (BIM) and sustainability have all been the subject of numerous studies
   that have been performed both separately and in pairs. Despite this,
   there are presently no studies that include both of these ideas. This
   paper aims to integrate various technologies, methodologies, and
   concepts to close this gap specific to the architecture, engineering,
   and construction (AEC) sectors by outlining how concepts could coexist
   and support one another. To that goal, a thorough literature study was
   conducted to determine how recently academics had investigated the
   synergies between these fields. Results point to synergies, mostly the
   benefits and barriers of BIM in the sustainable construction sector.
   After the literature review, 46 identified factors associated with
   benefits and 21 factors associated with barriers were obtained. Among
   the factors, ``Promoting carbon emission reduction{''} and ``Enhancing
   material wastage reduction{''} are the top environmental benefits of
   implementing BIM in sustainable construction projects. The popular
   economic benefits were ``Improving design efficiency{''}, ``Reducing the
   overall project costs{''}, and ``Promoting productivity{''} and the most
   important social benefit was ``Enhancing project safety and health
   performance{''}. On the other hand, the lack of experts was the major
   barrier to BIM implementation in sustainable construction projects.
   Thus, the findings assist the BIM and sustainability integration's
   benefits and barriers for a better and sustainable construction
   industry.},

Abstract = {The amount of information involved in any construction project and the
   necessity of control of time, cost and waste, has established Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) as an integral part of construction sector
   towards achieving adequate communication of information among various
   parties involved in construction projects. Moreover, it can be
   considered as a valuable tool for the optimum selection of materials,
   systems and design decisions, regarding not only the improve of a
   structure's performance, but also in terms of reducing its carbon
   footprint during its life cycle. The study attempts to present the
   integration of BIM into the national legislation of European Member
   States, with a special focus on the energy related aspects of BIM
   analysis. This study performs an overview of the introduction of BIM
   into different aspects and requirements of the EU Member States building
   practices, through a comprehensive literature and legislation review of
   relative legislative documents of the construction sector. According to
   the findings of this overview study, the concept of BIM has already been
   incorporated in many aspects of the Acquis of EU Member States, which is
   recognized as a valuable tool to be exploited by the construction
   sector, however there is still room for development in this area. The
   study has revealed that especially in the energy assessment of the built
   environment, BIM applications are still lacking from the European
   Legislation. Examples and good practices of employing BIM for the
   implementation of the European Energy targets in the building sector are
   also presented and discussed. The findings of this study aim to shed
   light on the needs and requirements in the field of BIM development for
   the construction sector, as well as to indicate gaps and weaknesses of
   the European Member States Acquis towards harmonizing with BIM
   practices.},

Title = {A PARAMETRIC APPROACH TOWARDS SEMI-AUTOMATED 3D AS-BUILT MODELING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {806-825},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been developed in response to
   the growing complexity of construction projects. BIM implementation is
   beneficial throughout the entire building life cycle, and thus has been
   widely adopted in new projects. However, BIM implementation in existing
   buildings is impeded by the lack of as -built models. Conventionally,
   three-dimensional (3D) as-built BIMs are generated by experienced
   modelers, which is time-consuming and error-prone. To cater to the need,
   Scan-to-BIM is a solution for automation in as-built BIM generation. In
   the context of automated Scan-to-BIM, the parametric modeling process is
   worth investigating as it has the ability to not only reconstruct 3D
   objects from a variety of categories from point clouds but also offer
   flexibility to update objects simply by changing the values of the
   correlative parameters. Hence, this study proposes a semi-automated
   framework for assisting 3D as-built modeling through a parametric
   modeling approach. The presented methodology starts with wall boundary
   parameter extraction through 3D to 2D projection of the wall segments
   and line detection techniques, followed by retrieving geometric
   parameters of all other non-wall elements via CloudCompare. The
   extracted parameters are structured into a Microsoft (R) Excel (R) file
   and fed into Autodesk (R) Dynamo for 3D BIM creation using a series of
   designed logic. To substantiate the viability, the proposed framework is
   employed in two datasets containing structural, architectural,
   furniture, mechanical, and plumbing objects (further categorized into
   structural, hosted and non-hosted elements). The Intersection over Union
   (IoU) of structural elements was 96.35\%, while the root-mean-square
   error (RMSE) of hosted and non-hosted elements was 3.634 and 2.607 mm,
   respectively. This study established a universal methodology for
   semi-automated 3D as -built modeling that can guide future research.},

Abstract = {As a set of new technologies to enhance life-cycle construction
   management processes, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been
   introduced to China's Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
   industries. Adopting the framework of
   Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and the theory of innovation
   diffusion, this study provides an empirical analysis of BIM adoption and
   its impact on corporation performance, using a time series panel sample
   of 1109 observations of AEC enterprises listed in China's A-share stock
   market. This study reveals that the decision of BIM adoption could be
   driven by corporate innovation strategy and government policy pressure.
   Overall, BIM implementation brings positive financial performance to the
   BIM adopted enterprises, but the differences of BIM performance between
   innovation strategy-led and policy-driven adoption are only significant
   in enterprises of state-controlled. This paper contributes to the body
   of knowledge in enriching the TOE framework by adding innovation
   strategy motivations in the organization context and government policy
   forces to the environment context. In addition, the findings of this
   paper might help policy makers around the world improve the acceptance
   of BIM technology and evaluate the effects of BIM policy.},

Title = {BIM4EarlyLCA: An interactive visualization approach for early design
   support based on uncertain LCA results using open BIM},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To meet the European climate goals in the building sector, a holistic
   optimization of embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the method
   of life cycle assessments (LCA) are necessary. The early design stages
   have high impact on the final performance of the buildings and are
   characterized by high uncertainty due to the lack of information and not
   yet taken decisions. Furthermore, most current LCA approaches based on
   Building Information Models (BIM) require high expertise and experience
   in both BIM and LCA and do not follow an intuitive visualization
   approach for other stakeholders and non-experts. This paper presents a
   novel designdecision-making approach for reducing embodied GHG emissions
   by interactive, model-based visualizations of uncertain LCA results. The
   proposed workflow is based on open BIM data formats, such as Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) and BIM Collaboration Format (BCF), and is
   developed for decision support for non-LCA experts in the early design
   stages. With the help of a user study, the prototypical implementation
   is tested by 103 participants with different levels of experience in BIM
   and LCA based on a case study. We evaluate the proposed approach
   regarding the support of open BIM data formats, different LCA
   visualization strategies, and the intuitiveness of different approaches
   to visualizing uncertain LCA results. The user study results show a
   broad acceptance and need for open BIM data formats and model-based LCA
   visualization but less for visualizing uncertainties, which needs
   further research. In conclusion, this interactive, model-based
   visualization approach using color coding supports non-LCA experts in
   the design decision-making process in early design stages.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},

Abstract = {It is critical that an asset-centric organisation understand the
   importance of their engineered assets to operate successfully. Despite
   this, organisations struggle to view assets within the context of
   whole-life management and ultimately struggle to harness their full
   potential value. A recurring theme is the challenges in capturing,
   storing and validating data across a diverse and complex asset
   portfolio. The primary reason for this is the fundamental lack of
   understanding of what information should be collected to support the
   efficient management of assets throughout their life. Asset-related
   information that is not collected in alignment to the organisational
   requirements will restrict the performance of capital investment
   decisions, risk management and operational performance throughout the
   whole life of the asset portfolio and ultimately have an impact on
   productivity. This paper presents a top-down methodology that utilises
   Building Information Modelling to support the development of Asset
   Information Requirements. The novel aspect of this approach is the
   development of Functional Information Requirements to bridge the gap
   between organisational requirements and Asset Information Requirements.},

Abstract = {The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) is gaining momentum in digital built Asset
   Management (AM), and has the potential to improve information management
   operations and provide advantages in process control and delivery of
   quality AM services, along with underlying data management benefits
   through entire life cycle of an asset. Work has been carried out
   relating GeoBIM/AM to buildings as well as infrastructure assets, where
   the potential financial savings are extensive. While information form
   BIM maybe be sufficient for building-AM; for infrastructure AM a
   combination of GIS and BIM is required. Scientific literature relating
   to this topic has been growing in recent years and has now reached a
   point where a systematic analysis of current and potential uses of
   GeoBIM in AM for Infrastructure is possible. Three specific areas form
   part of the analysis - a review of BIM and Infrastructure AM and GIS and
   Infrastructure AM leads to a better understanding of current practice.
   Combining the two, a review of GeoBIM and Infrastructure AM allows the
   benefits of, and issues relating to, GeoBIM to be clearly identified,
   both at technical and operational levels. A set of 54 journal articles
   was selected for in-depth contents analysis according to the AM function
   addressed and the managed asset class. The analysis enabled the
   identification of three categories of issues and opportunities: data

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the advancement of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology,
   BIM gains more importance and becomes a prerequisite in building
   projects. BIM is useful throughout a building lifecycle; from building
   bid, design, construction, completion, operation, and maintenance to
   building demolition. However, current information exchange surrounding
   BIM is still limited and bound to a single participant or organization
   and is also limited to a particular phase in the building lifecycle.
   This paper aims to explore BIM information exchange among many parties
   involved in a secure manner using a blockchain platform throughout the
   whole building lifecycle. In this research, many parties involved in the
   building project will be able to recognize one another through
   deployment of a permissioned blockchain. This information exchange uses
   Hyperledger Composer, a permissioned blockchain running on a blockchain
   platform called Hyperledger Fabric. Our experiment shows that BIM
   information exchange could be further improved. In this study, BIM
   information exchange can be implemented not only in one building phase
   but throughout the whole building lifecycle. It also facilitates BIM
   information exchange among multiple participants in a secure manner via
   a permissioned blockchain.},

Abstract = {At the present stage of the development of the construction industry,
   based on the principles of sustainable development, special attention
   should be paid to the formation of construction waste. Reserves for
   improving the level of efficiency of waste management can be found in
   the application of modern information technologies and their adaptation
   to resource-saving problems. The use of information systems is advisable
   at all stages of the life cycle of a building. Today, the technology of
   building information modeling (BIM) is actively developing, which can
   significantly reduce the amount of waste generation in construction.
   This is possible with its implementation at the design stage, in order
   to avoid irrational design decisions, collisions, etc. Information
   systems for data transmission allow rapid exchange of information
   between project participants, promptly warn about changes in
   space-planning decisions, materials, structures and equipment. At the
   stage of operation, in the presence of the information model of the
   building, it is possible to create a planning system for the
   organization of works of major overhaul or reconstruction. This article
   also proposes a description of the functions that an information system
   must have aimed at coordinating the management of construction waste in
   the region.},

Title = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of normalization factors to
   methodological assumptions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {224-236},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose Normalisation is an optional step of a life cycle assessment,
   supporting the interpretation of the results of the characterization in
   terms of relative environmental relevance of the impacts. Normalisations
   factors (NFs) are calculated as results of regional/global inventories
   of emission and resources characterized through impact assessment
   methods. Several methodological assumptions are needed for building the
   inventory, as presented in Sala et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess
   20:1568-1585, 2015). NFs for EU27 have been calculated for 2010
   compliant with ILCD recommendations defining a methodological approach
   for sources selection and the use of proxy indicators. Qualitative and
   quantitative uncertainty evaluation is needed for assessing the
   robustness of final figures. The present work aims at quantifying the
   influence of key methodological choices on the variability of the
   normalisation factors.
   Materials and methods Five sources of uncertainty have been analyzed in
   this work: (F1) the selection of the sources of data; (F2) the
   classification of data as life cycle inventory (LCI) elementary flows;
   (F3) the classification of substances for characterization; (F4) the
   specification of the emission compartments and (F5) the use of spatially
   differentiated characterization factors. The sensitivity of the
   normalization factors to such uncertainties were assessed through a
   global sensitivity method, for the impact categories acidification
   (ACID), terrestrial eutrophication (ET), marine eutrophication (EM),
   photochemical ozone formation (POF), respiratory inorganics/particulate
   matter (RIPM) and water depletion (WD).
   Results and discussion The results demonstrate the need of thorough
   uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for supporting the use of NFs.
   Uncertainties are high for the impact categories respiratory inorganics
   (RIPM) and water depletion (WD) and improvement of these categories is a
   priority. For RIPM this is explained by the high variability amongst the
   characterization factors for PM2.5 and PM10, together with the
   contextual lack of information about the height of the emission source
   in the inventory. For WD this is explained by variability of the
   regionalized factors available within the ILCD. For ACID, ET and EM the
   uncertainty is relatively low and generally completely led by factors F1
   and F2. However, regionalized characterization factors were not tested
   for ACID and ET, therefore the results might be underestimating the
   overall uncertainty. For what concerns POF, the main source of
   uncertainty-amongst those included in the analysis-is the selection of
   the data source. Overall, improvements in the spatial resolution of the
   inventory are needed in order to confine uncertainty. This would allow
   the use of characterization factors specific for emission source
   typology and geographical location.
   Conclusions The uncertainty associated with the methodological choices
   made for calculating normalization factors (Sala et al. in Int J Life
   Cycle Assess 20:1568-1585, 2015) was assessed. Generally, the value
   calculated by Sala et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 20:1568-1585, 2015)
   compare well against average and median values estimated in this
   analysis for ACID, ET, EM and POF. Instead, the impact categories RIPM
   and WD show different patterns. For RIPM, although the average value is
   very similar to the normalization factor reported by Sala et al. (Int J
   Life Cycle Assess 20:1568-1585, 2015), the median value is far lower.
   For what concerns WD, the median value is much higher. Future
   improvements of the normalization factors should therefore prioritize
   the development of more detailed inventories of emissions by including
   higher substance resolution, height of emission as well as the use of
   spatially differentiated characterization factors. To support the
   interpretation of normalized results, we recommend that the
   normalization factors from Sala et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess
   20:1568-1585, 2015) are applied together with two additional sets of
   normalization factors i.e. the `median values' and the set of `average +
   standard deviation' values, so to better capture their uncertainty.
   Similarly, the interpretation of the results should build on the
   qualitative estimates of robustness provided by Sala et al. (Int J Life
   Cycle Assess 20:1568-1585, 2015).},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) teams, hereafter referred to as
   BIM-based construction networks, are teams whose possibly geographically
   dispersed members from various organisations and disciplines, perform
   project tasks on BIM-enabled projects. In recent years, BIM-based
   construction networks have progressively become the norm in executing
   BIM activities on projects. However, even though achieving BIM's full
   capabilities relies on effective collaboration among the team members in
   BIM-based construction networks, it is still a struggle for these
   members to collaborate. Nonetheless, only a few studies have been
   conducted to identify the barriers to strengthening team collaboration
   in BIM-based construction networks. To address this gap, the current
   study, by examining 73 journal articles on collaboration in BIM-based
   construction networks, builds upon a theoretical review of the
   literature. A conceptual model is presented to capture the main barriers
   to collaboration in BIM-based construction networks. The study benefits
   researchers as well as project managers. For researchers, the conceptual
   model provides an intermediate theory, namely, a theoretical basis to
   direct further knowledge creation attempts on the topic. In addition,
   the conceptual model supports project managers on BIM-enabled projects.
   That is, it simplifies the knowledge now available for practical
   applications enabling it to be translated into guidelines and practical
   instructions on real-life projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA.

Abstract = {This paper describes how the construction value-chain can improve its
   design integration and operation by using knowledge-based tools as part
   of Integrated Design Solutions. The tools described support a continuous
   knowledge improvement cycle to obtain the best results and effects from
   an industrial approach across the phases of design, engineering,
   construction, and operations. The tools referred in this paper consist
   of three main components: Experience, focused on learning and knowledge
   management; House Designer, focused on building design and development;
   and Supervisor, focused on project configuration and information
   management.
   We describe the collaboration processes and the integrated flow of
   knowledge and information through the various value-chain phases. We
   further discuss how all parts of the construction value chain can
   benefit from specific knowledge management and how product life-cycle
   efficiency is best assured by the combined use of knowledge management
   tools. Both experienced issues regarding technical integration and use
   cases are presented.},

Abstract = {gbXML is an open schema that supports data inter-operability between BIM
   applications and different building design software tools (gbXML, 2018).
   Its capability to bring in geometric and construction information can
   help reduce the time and uncertainty of the energy modeling process (Ham
   and GolparvarFard, 2015). However, during the design cycle, when both
   geometric and system data are updated continuously, the lack of methods
   to quickly insert system information in the BIM-exported gbXML has a
   significant impact on the modeling efficiency as well as the model
   integrity. This project aims to develop an open-source gbXML to
   EnergyPlus translator, the gbEplus, which provides flexibility for
   user-defined system modules plug-in. It adopts the OpenStudio reverse
   translator to ensure a quality geometry and construction data
   conversion. A plug-in interface is designed as the gateway for importing
   data from external resources to gbXML-EnergyPlus translation process in
   the run-time, and all the previously developed system modules can be

Title = {Closing the loop in building services: A systematic review of circular
   economy applications},
Journal = {BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 25},
Abstract = {The substantial environmental impact of buildings has garnered
   significant attention. However, sustainability efforts often prioritise
   structural and envelope materials, overlooking building services -
   systems for ensuring occupants' safety and comfort. Given their
   complexity, rapid technological advancements, and substantial costs,
   these components necessitate a circular economy approach to optimise
   resource utilisation. This study conducts a systematic literature review
   to assess the current state of circular economy implementation in
   building services, identifying barriers, opportunities, key influencers,
   and potential strategies. Findings indicate that applying circular
   economy principles within building services remains nascent. Barriers
   encompass technical, economic, legislative, and organisational
   challenges. Conversely, numerous opportunities exist, alongside six key
   influential stakeholders. The analysis enabled the development of a
   framework to integrate existing principles and building blocks with
   identified essential strategies for advancing circular building
   services. The integrated strategies include design, business models,
   policy, product information, warranties, life cycle costing, digital
   technology, education, collaboration, and transparency. This study
   recognises various research gaps and highlights the need for further
   exploration to realise the full potential of circular economy in
   building services. Ultimately, a shift in mindset, coupled with new
   skills and holistic approaches, is required to drive progress in this
   domain.Practical application The application of circular economy in
   building services is still nascent, representing a missing piece for
   advancing sustainable construction. This paper examines the existing
   knowledge in this domain to identify barriers, opportunities, and key
   influencers. The strategies identified enabled a framework for advancing
   circular building services. The study is vital for engineers, designers,
   researchers, policy makers, and all other stakeholders to advance
   circularity in the building services sector.},

Title = {Life cycle cost-based optimization framework for seismic design and
   target safety quantification of dual steel buildings with
   buckling-restrained braces},
Journal = {EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING \& STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 14},
Abstract = {This study proposes an efficient risk-targeted framework for integrated
   optimal seismic design and quantifying target safety of Special
   Moment-Resisting Frames (SMRFs) with Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRBs)
   in the typical dual steel buildings. This framework provides an
   automated design procedure formulated as a constrained single-objective
   optimization problem to achieve the minimum Life Cycle Cost (LCC) within
   the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and can be the basis of
   current seismic codes for target safety calibration. LCC includes
   initial construction cost and lifetime seismic losses such as repair
   cost, repair time, and casualties. FEMA P-58 methodology is employed for
   the LCC analysis of the building under possible earthquakes during its
   lifetime, which is able to take into account potential uncertainties in
   the hazard-response-damage-loss relationship. An appropriate cost model
   is developed to estimate the initial and repair cost of the studied
   BRBs. Minimum requirements of ASCE and AISC codes are considered as
   design constraints. Nonlinear response history analysis through the
   Endurance Time (ET) method is utilized to estimate the structural
   responses versus seismic intensity. Three 4-, 8-, and 12-story steel
   buildings with dual seismic force-resisting system consisting of SMRF
   and BRB (called steel SMRF-BRB) are selected as the case study. Each
   building is optimally designed with two approaches: (1) LCC-based design
   within the proposed framework and (2) code-based design to minimize
   initial construction cost. Comparison of optimized buildings with the
   two design approaches in terms of structural responses and seismic
   consequences demonstrates that fulfilling the minimum code requirements
   at a given seismic hazard level is not sufficient to minimize lifetime
   seismic losses of steel SMRF-BRBs. This is because the optimal designs
   obtained from the code-based approach are associated with damage
   concentration, irreparability, and high collapse probability, especially
   in seismic events more severe than the design level. The proposed
   LCC-based approach provides useful information for improving the
   lifetime seismic performance of steel SMRF-BRBs.},

Abstract = {Cost analysis and value analysis techniques are frequently used to
   quantify and assess the economic implications for a particular project.
   These techniques have typically concentrated on utilizing life cycle and
   comparative cost procedures to determine either the lowest initial cost
   alternative or the highest investment return alternative While these
   techniques do provide a basis for making project cost decisions, they
   most often do not account for many of the parameters, which may affect
   the actual project value or cost.
   This paper uses the traditional value analysis techniques to review
   three exterior wall systems for a hypothetical retail building. These
   three systems include 8{''} concrete masonry, 2x6 wood studs, and 5
   1/2{''} concrete tiltup construction. Each system is analyzed to
   calculate the estimated initial building cost as well as the anticipated
   present worth of the building.
   The systems are also analyzed using simulation software to account for
   the potential variability of the parameters used in the cost and value
   models. The results of this technique provide probablistic information
   on the potential costs and values of the various wall system.
   By using this probabilistic approach, the expected cost and value ranges
   can more accurately reflect the actual life cycle costs of the system.
   With these results, the owner or design team can make strategic
   decisions based on analysis results that truly reflect the inherent
   risks and costs related to the project.},

Abstract = {School syllabus in Higher Education degrees related with Construction
   are requested to be reviewed on account of the appearance of a new
   project methodology known as Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM
   methodology entails a paradigm change for the construction industry and,
   thus, for various academic degrees such as Civil Engineering. The use of
   BIM involves an integral management information of the constructive
   project. All the information required for the entire life cycle of
   certain construction project can be incorporated in a three-dimensional
   computer model. Governments around the world have also taken decisions
   in order to boost the use of BIM. In Spain, it is expected that it will
   be required in civil engineering projects from July 2019. Therefore, the
   implementation of BIM methodologies in university subjects is required.
   This paper describes the teaching strategies of a new curricular subject
   organized in order to meet the demands of the construction field. A
   general description of the module, the objectives of the course,
   contents, tools and techniques required for the use of BIM are described
   in detail as well as the most remarkable considerations made in order to
   design the subject in the Civil Engineering School (Escuela de Caminos,

Abstract = {Diversfication in project delivery methods (PDM) over the last two
   decades has signficantly changed the roles of architects, engineers, and
   contractors in the construction industry. Under the emerging alternative
   PDMs, the common requirements for architects include `planning
   capability', `integrated understanding of design and construction', and
   `IT skills' in addition to traditional architects' qualifications. In
   order to meet these requirements, a novel approach to educating future
   architects was attempted at Myongji University as a capstone project for
   the 5-year architecture program. This studio was entitled CM \& BIM
   studio focusing on three objectives in design studios; planning,
   life-cycle integration, and building information modeling (BIM). This
   paper proposes a curriculum for the CM \& BIM studio with detailed
   teaching objectives and student deliverables. Educational requirements
   in the age of new architecture were identified first. The CM \& BIM
   studio in 2012 as a case study was introduced in order to validate the
   adaptability of proposed curriculum. Comments from professors and
   architects verified and encouraged the promising educational results
   intended in this paper. Finally, findings and lessons learned are also

Abstract = {PurposeStudies show that building information modelling (BIM) technology
   can improve construction productivity regarding the design, construction
   and maintenance of a project life cycle in the 21st century. Revit has
   been identified as a frequently used tool for delivering BIM in the
   built environment. Studies about BIM technology via Revit are scarce in
   training middle-level workforce higher education institutions. Thus,
   this study aims to investigate the relevance of BIM technology and offer
   measures to promote digitalisation in Nigeria's built environment
   polytechnic undergraduates via Revit.Design/methodology/approachGiven
   the unexplored nature of training the middle-level workforce in Nigeria,
   37 semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted across Nigeria, and
   saturation was achieved. The participants were knowledgeable about
   construction-related BIM. The researchers used a thematic analysis for
   the collected data and honed them with secondary
   sources.FindingsImproved visualisation of design, effective and
   efficient work productivity, automatic design and quantification,
   improved database management and collaboration and data storage in the
   centrally coordinated model, among others, emerged as BIM's benefits.
   BIM technology via Revit is challenging, especially in Nigeria's
   polytechnic education curriculum. The 24 perceived issues were grouped
   into government/regulatory agencies-related, polytechnic
   management-related and polytechnic undergraduate students-related
   hindrances in Nigeria's built environment.Research
   limitations/implicationsThis study is limited to BIM implications for
   Nigeria's built environment polytechnic
   undergraduates.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature
   paucity in attempting to uncover perceived issues hindering the

Title = {Recycling Waste Construction Material and Industry Involvement in
   University Investigations: Developing a Framework},

Abstract = {This study developed novel metrics and utilized content analysis in
   terms of keywords selected, scholarly publications, and social media
   posts to identify trends and industry involvement. A data set of
   publications was created based on collected materials from Scopus and
   social media and analyzed using statistical tests, rigorous content
   analysis, and network analysis. The data set was used to develop a
   framework for assessing the maturity of research topics and a
   classification system for labeling publications. The framework includes
   some indicators, such as total publications and a variety of
   applications, which are assessed based on a scale of 4. The
   classification system suggests four components: (1) product, (2)
   construction and demolition waste, (3) additives, and (4) experiments to
   be considered by authors. The framework and the categorization system
   may assist academics and practitioners in predicting topic trends and
   offer a set of indicators for conducting systematic reviews to identify
   gaps in the literature. Also, total publications as one of the framework
   indicators reveals that 46\% of Canadian publications and 20.7\% of US
   publications exhibited industry involvement compared with 15\% of
   Australian publications and 15\% of UK publications. The analysis shows
   that the top-occurring keyword in the data set is recycled asphalt
   pavement, which is linked to 22.2\% of the data set, followed by
   recycled concrete and recycled aggregate concrete appearing in 12\%.
   Aside from keywords related to materials, two of the most commonly
   occurring techniques in the data set of keywords are building
   information modeling and life cycle assessment, which still need further
   investigation along with GIS for waste minimization.},

Abstract = {Building lead us to use renewable energy sources for all types of
   buildings. The use of solar energy is the alternatives that can be
   applied in a good ratio of space, price, and resultant benefits.
   Building Information Modelling is a modern and effective way of dealing
   with buildings with regard to all aspects of the life cycle. The basis
   is careful planning and simulation in the pre-investment phase, where it
   is possible to determine the effective result and influence the lifetime
   of the building and the cost of its operation. By simulating, analysing
   and insert a building model into its future environment where climate
   conditions and surrounding buildings play a role, it is possible to
   predict the usability of the solar energy and establish an ideal model.
   Solar systems also very affect the internal layout of buildings.
   Pre-investment phase analysis, with a view to future aspects, will
   ensure that the resulting building will be both low-energy and
   environmentally friendly.},

Title = {Environmental assessment at the urban level combining LCA-GIS
   methodologies: A case study of energy retrofits in the Barcelona
   metropolitan area},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {191-204},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This study proposes a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS) methodology to develop complex
   LCA inventories for multiple applications. The study focusses on the
   environmental implications of buildings retrofits, especially in the
   European context, where the building sector is one of the largest energy
   consumers. In this context, a new and holistic perspective is needed
   that expands from the building scale to the urban scale.
   The combination of LCA and GIS methods includes the development of an
   urban characterization model based on bottom-up methodologies. The
   environmental implications associated with increasing the thermal
   insulation of existing buildings to the current standard are determined
   based on LCA methods. In this step, common construction systems for
   building retrofits are used, and insulation materials are compared.
   Then, absolute and relative extrapolations are performed considering
   different urban morphologies.
   The results confirm the importance of the energy retrofitting of
   residential buildings in large functional urban areas such as the
   Barcelona metropolitan area, which is examined as a case study. The LCA
   results indicate that the selection of proper construction systems and
   thermal insulation materials is important to the environmental
   performance of building retrofits, and these selections can lead to CO2
   emission differences of up 16\% in the region. The relative
   extrapolation results indicate significant environmental differences
   between urban morphologies. The LCA results show the potential strategic
   impacts of the inclusion of LCA methods in retrofit policies at the
   urban scale.},

Title = {Case studies of eXtended reality combined with Building Information
   Modeling: A literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This review article deals with the integration of eXtended Reality (XR)
   into Building Information Modeling (BIM), based on sixty recent case
   studies. This pair raises interest because, even if XR is still weakly
   used in AEC firms, it may increase the exploitation degree of BIM tools,
   which are instead becoming comprehensive information repositories and
   design and management tools along the building's life cycle. The
   considered case studies have been grouped into the following 4
   categories: I) training, II) design, III) construction, and IV)
   operation. The works considered in each group were studied by
   identifying the main purpose, novelty, used tools, country, etc. Group I
   includes ten works, prominently based on VR, which mainly aim at
   facilitating visualization and increasing the users' overall engagement
   into the training activity. Group II includes nineteen works
   (prominently VR-based), which mainly aim at increasing the stakeholders'
   collaboration and design understanding, for more informed
   decision-making. The eighteen works in Group III (mainly AR- and
   MR-based) provide deeper insights about information accessibility,
   inspection, and defect management, by means of site walkthroughs and
   enhanced position registration solutions. Finally, the thirteen works in
   Group IV mainly use VR and MR, for higher understanding of the relevant
   sites. BIM is mostly paired with VR (52 \% of the case studies).
   Moreover, Unity3D may be identified as the prominent development
   platform. Even if many purposes, tools, and approaches are covered,
   documented case studies seem still few if compared with the overall
   economic and human resources involved in the building industry.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effectiveness of a return policy as an
   incentive-aligned coordination mechanism in a decentralised supply chain
   for short life-cycle products. System performance with regards to
   profitability and product availability is assessed with a coordinated
   return policy between the vendor and two competing retailers. Building
   on the optimal return policy coordination model for short life-cycle
   products, this paper evaluates individual and joint effects of
   competition and coordination under the four different settings of
   competition with and without coordination, and no competition with and
   without coordination. Results indicate that joint effects are largely
   contingent on demand structures in the supply chain, whereas
   individually, return policy coordination displays greater effectiveness
   in improving fill rates at local retailers by maintaining high stocking
   levels and competition commands significant impact in improving the
   system profitability and service level by creating inventory pooling
   effects between competing retailers.},

   CCI versus Uniclass 2015},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {By classifying BIM data, the intention is to enable different
   construction actors to find the data they need using software and
   machines. The importance of classification is growing as building
   projects become more international, generating more data that rely on
   automated processes, which help in making better decisions and operating
   devices. Different classification systems have been developed around the
   world. Each national construction information classification system
   (NCICS) aims to classify information on the built environment and thus
   meet national needs and ensure compliance with the principles of
   regional and international building information systems. The research
   purpose of this paper is to present a comparative assessment of two
   construction information classification systems, CCI and Uniclass 2015.
   The following methods were used: the expert assessment of NCICS
   alternatives; the assessment of NCICS alternatives; and a strengths,
   weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of NCICS
   alternatives. We concluded that in the initial phase of NCICS
   development, CCI ontologies should be adopted as a base consisting of
   construction entities, spaces, and elements, with the gradual addition
   of complexes of buildings and infrastructure, along with roles and
   phases of the building life cycle (BLC). An explanatory NCICS
   development note should be drawn outlining the principles of
   classification and identification; the ontological structure;
   development and updating possibilities; methods of integrating existing
   national and international classification systems; and methods of
   integrating data of construction products, time, cost, or other
   individual characteristics.},

Title = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) adoption and implementation
   enablers in AEC firms: a systematic literature review},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has gained much attention in recent
   years, as both a new innovation and methodology. Many architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) firms have reported significant
   competitive advantages following its implementation. Despite the variety
   of benefits that BIM offers, its potential has not yet been fully
   realised. A key reason for this can be located in the difficulties of
   implementation at the organisational level; a process that demands
   significant changes in organisational business structure. However, there
   exists little extensive study on the analysis and synthesis of the
   literature surrounding organisational BIM implementation. This paper
   presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on studies from 2004 to
   July 2019 to allow for a thorough synthesis of the existing BIM
   literature, innovation management, and information technology domains to
   identify BIM adoption and implementation enablers. Of the 80 selected
   studies, 27 enablers were identified to contribute to a more
   comprehensive utilisation of BIM at the organisational level. These
   included strategic initiatives, cultural readiness, learning capacity,
   knowledge capability and IT leveragability, network relationships,
   process and performance management, and change management practices. The
   role each implementation enabler has in IT-equipped innovations
   generally and to BIM implementation specifically is discussed
   throughout. The results of this paper seek to aid AEC firms in gauging
   the organisational readiness of the implementation process as well as
   the required interventions and capability development for successful BIM
   implementation overall.},

Title = {Development of social sustainability assessment method and a comparative
   case study on assessing recycled construction materials},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1654-1674},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sustainability analysis should include the assessment of the
   environmental, social, and economic impacts throughout the life cycle of
   a product. However, the social sustainability performance assessment is
   seldom carried out during materials selection due to its complex nature
   and the lack of a social life cycle assessment tool. This study presents
   a single score-based social life cycle assessment methodology, namely
   social sustainability grading model, for assessing and comparing the
   social sustainability performance of construction materials using a case
   study on recycled and natural construction materials.
   The proposed method is developed based on the methodological framework
   provided by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of
   Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry guidelines published in 2009 and
   the methodological sheets published in 2013, the indicators and
   sustainability reporting guidelines provided by the Global Reporting
   Initiatives and ISO 26000 for social responsibility of products, and the
   indicators provided by the Hong Kong Business Environment Council
   Limited for construction sustainability. A twofold research approach is
   proposed in this model: the first one is the qualitative research based
   on expert interviews to identify, select, and prioritize the relevant
   subcategories and indicators, and the second one is the operational
   research based on the case-specific survey to collect the required data.
   A social sustainability index was proposed for the interpretation of the
   results effectively. A case study on construction materials was
   conducted to illustrate the implementation of the method using
   case-specific first-hand data.
   The major outcome of this study is the systematic development of a
   social sustainability assessment tool based on the established standards
   and guidelines. The case study showed that four subcategories are
   crucial social concerns for construction materials (i.e., health and
   safety issues of the materials, health and safety of workers, company's
   commitment to sustainability, and company's policies on energy and water
   consumption). Based on the sustainability index proposed, using recycled
   aggregates from locally generated waste materials scored higher (about
   31-34\%) social sustainability than using imported natural aggregates.
   In addition, recycled aggregates and natural aggregates achieved
   ``sustainable{''} and ``neutral{''} rating sustainability levels,
   respectively. However, several subcategories (e.g., health and safety,
   working hour, forced work, training and social benefits of workers, and
   quality of the materials and information disclosing to public) are still
   needed to improve the social sustainability performance of recycled
   aggregates.
   An integrated social life cycle assessment method is presented in this
   study for assessing the social sustainability of construction materials.
   In addition, the reported case study in this paper is one of the first
   attempts for social sustainability assessment of recycled construction
   materials, and the method can be applied to other recycled
   materials/products for comparative analysis. However, several critical
   factors, such as integration in other life cycle methods and software,
   sensitivity analysis, and more case studies, are still needed for
   further improvement of the developed method.},

Title = {Limitations of machine-interpretability of digital EPDs used for a
   BIM-based sustainability assessment of construction assets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {96},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Construction assets are complex systems that require the analysis of a
   huge amount of data from materials and processes in order to perform a
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Information from construction products and
   materials are usually provided with Environmental Product Declarations
   (EPDs), which will be incorporated in LCA or Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) software for sustainability assessment purposes. This
   research studied digital EPDs available from Programme Operators, in
   order to identify the limitations for an automatic computer transfer of
   EPD-data into software tools without previous human interpretation of
   the content. Several implemented solutions were analysed, such as the
   international standard EN ISO 22057, the ILCD+EPD format, IFC or Smart
   CE. The research includes the evaluation of the scientific literature
   and the ISO, IEC and CEN/CENELEC standards related to sustainability
   assessment of buildings and infrastructures, EPDs or BIM. The study
   identifies limitations for computer-interpretability of digital EPDs,
   such as the definition of scenarios and the unique identification of the
   elements and performance characteristics. The discussion and conclusions
   assess the identified limitations and provide some preliminary solutions
   for future research. The results can be applied to other construction
   productrelated data and/or to EPD or LCA data from other sectors. The
   significance of this research relies on bridging the gap between digital
   EPDs and BIM, reducing the cost and time required for the LCA of built
   assets, supporting the application of science-based policies and the
   measurement of ESG indicators used by public and private organisations
   in relation to buildings and infrastructures.},

Abstract = {A generic methodology is presented for time-dependent reliability
   analysis of systems consisting of repairable and/or non-repairable
   components. The time to failure and repair time of components are
   considered as random variables, which are modeled by general
   (non-exponential).probability distributions. The time-dependent failure
   and repair rates are derived for each individual component of the system
   by solving a set of renewal equations. The component level information
   is used to compute the system failure rate and availability. The
   application of the proposed method is illustrated by the optimization of
   the life cycle cost of a structural system. It is noted that most of the
   literature on structural system reliability analysis focuses on systems
   with non-repairable components only. Thus the proposed approach is a
   significant generalization of the current approached for computing the
   life-cycle cost. The proposed method can be applied to a variety of
   infrastructure systems, such as bridges, buildings and power systems.},

Abstract = {The Directive 2010/31 UE (EBPD) introduced the ``Nearly Zero Energy
   Buildings{''} linked to cost optimality, where energy benefits are
   related to economic benefits. The ``Cost Optimality{''} methodology is
   applicable both to new and existing buildings, as introduced in the
   Regulation 244/2012. This methodology was largely applied to existing
   building, but the literature on historic buildings lacks. However, given
   the potential of energy retrofit of this kind of buildings, it would be
   appropriate to develop a specific methodology for the economic
   valorization of the heritage, considering also the conservation and the
   historic value of the patrimony. In fact, on the one hand this
   methodology could be useful for the ``energy valorization{''} of a
   historic building in relation to the minimum requirements of European
   and national legislations and budgets. However, on the other hand, we
   noted the absence of shared information at national level and examples
   of the ``historic reference buildings{''}. For this reason, case studies
   on historic buildings become an important starting point to create
   common typological and repeat-able models for applying this methodology.
   This research aims at evaluating the economic benefits of energy
   retrofit of a traditional historic masonry, using the ``Cost
   Optimality{''} methodology. This method is structured into the following
   parts: (i) definition of the type of masonry; (ii) selection of the
   insulation systems; (iii) assessment of the energy benefits related to
   the insertion of various insulation materials; (iv) evaluation of the
   Life Cycle Costing; (v) evaluation of the optimal insulation performance
   and costeffectiveness; and (vi) comparison of energy consumption and
   Life Cycle Cost to de-fine the most appropriate interventions for the
   historic wall. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Urban mining potential to reduce primary material use and carbon
   emissions in the Dutch residential building sector},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {180},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Urban mining is regarded as an important strategy to replace primary raw
   materials in the building sector. This study presents a bottom-up
   dynamic building stock model to explore the potential of urban mining to
   reduce primary material consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   in the residential building sector of the Netherlands. The model builds
   upon geo-referenced individual buildings, making it possible to analyze
   the spatiotemporal pattern of material supply from demolition and
   material demand for construction and renovation. The main results can be
   summarized as three points. (1) Urban mining cannot meet future material
   demand due to the new construction caused by population increase and its
   limited ability to supply the required kinds and amounts of materials.
   Therefore, large amounts of primary materials still have to be consumed
   in the future. (2) The generation of demolition wastes and the
   requirement for materials will be mainly concentrated in the big cities
   (e.g. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague). (3) The GHG emission
   reduction potential of urban mining is very small and is not as large as
   the transition to a greener electricity mix. Recycling together with a
   greener electricity mix would reduce annual GHG emissions by about 40\%
   in 2050 compared to 2020. This study provides a tool to link future
   material inflows and outflows in space and time. It further helps to
   assess the performance of strategies aimed at closing the material loops
   and reducing GHG emissions in the building sector.},

Abstract = {Buildings demand a significant amount of energy during their life
   cycles, hence, effective design measures need to be adopted to ensure
   efficient energy usage and management in buildings. This study proposes
   a framework based on various performance parameters to enable
   decision-makers utilizing standard procedures and software to empower
   the process of sustainable energy use and management in buildings,
   through a parametric analysis in different climatic conditions.
   Experimental design is adopted within the framework via the use of
   various performance parameters related to the building design (i.e.,
   construction materials for exterior walls and roofs, as well as a set of
   window-to-wall ratios). Results indicate that climate data plays a
   fundamental role in the choice of design factors that are best suited
   for effective energy consumption in buildings. In particular, sub-type
   climate classifications, as opposed to the primary climate group, have a
   minor influence. Around 15\% improvement in the energy consumption in
   buildings is noticed due to changes to the design factor such as the
   window-to-wall ratio. Insights that can be gleaned from this study
   include the impact of space area, exterior openings and material
   thickness and choice for the envelope of the building in all climate
   classifications, aiding in the design of low-energy buildings.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a descriptive term for the
   technologically advanced, collaborative and information-centric
   processes used to drive design, construction and operation of the built
   environment. BIM is essentially value creating collaboration through the
   entire life-cycle of an asset (building or infrastructure), underpinned
   by the creation, collation and exchange of shared 3D models and
   intelligent, structured data attached to them. BIM is also about a shift
   in culture that will affect the way the built environment and
   infrastructure works and how it is delivered. Historically the health
   and safety record of the construction industry in the UK is relatively
   poor as compared to the manufacturing industries. BIM and the digital
   environment it operates within now allow us to use design and
   construction data in a more intelligent way. It allows data generated by
   the design process to be re-purposed and contribute to improving
   efficiencies in other areas of a project. This evolutionary step in
   design is not only creating exciting opportunities for the designers
   themselves but it is also creating opportunity for every stakeholder in
   any given project. From designers, engineers, contractors through to
   H\&S managers, BIM is accelerating a cultural change. The paper
   describes the idea behind a research project at the University of
   Birmingham that uses BIM as a platform to elucidate construction,
   operation and maintenance health hazards and using the principles of
   prevention devise mechanisms for their control.},

Abstract = {In this on research-based article, models presented further are
   representing complex concepts and facilitating their understanding. The
   models describe the categorization of the recorded knowledge obtained
   from the analysis of the monitored processes. Some of these models are
   descriptive (for example, the Venn diagram representing the
   interconnection of BIM spaces), others are predictive (e.g. a model
   representing the effects of BIM on the life cycle of a project), and
   others will be instructive-clarifying the sequence of actions that
   follow on to achieve a predefined output, such as a workflow model,
   representing authorization, identification, classification, aggregation,
   and usage. We can look at BIM as a framework modelling set of minimal
   sets of principles needed to model the basic building characteristics,
   along with a clear categorization of knowledge in identified and
   recorded models. Taxonomy is an effective and efficient way to organize
   and consolidate knowledge. A well-structured taxonomy allows for
   ``meaningful gathering of experience{''}. As we develop specialized
   taxonomies for organizing BIM domain knowledge, we will try to adopt the
   guidelines introduced by research. That is, the taxonomy is expected to
   be complex and complete; including classes that covering all the
   phenomena of our interest; based on decision-making rules, which are
   simple and stingy to assign instances to classes; and classes should be
   mutually exclusive. Moreover, because taxonomy is here as a tool for
   better understanding, these classes should be comprehensible and look
   natural.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the
   years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science
   and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been
   explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing,
   automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented
   approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering
   industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on
   external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A
   rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of
   DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum,
   building information modeling (BIM) is pervasively utilized in the
   planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction
   phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this article, we
   present a phase-based development of DT in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industry. We commence by presenting
   succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service, and establish
   a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a
   systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at
   each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling
   technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the
   Internet of things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to
   reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil
   engineering projects, and nudge researchers to think more holistically
   in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering
   applications.},

Title = {Building information modelling-enabled multi-objective optimization for
   energy consumption parametric analysis in green buildings design using
   hybrid machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {300},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Green buildings (GB) have been widely promoted in various nations.
   However, the post occupancy evaluation suggests many GB cannot well
   fulfill the expected targets. To overcome the mismatch among GB's
   multiobjectives, this paper develops an efficient and intelligent hybrid
   method using BIM-DesignBuilder (BIM-DB), Grey wolf optimization (GWO),
   random forest (RF) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
   (NSGA-II) to achieve the optimization of design parameters. The BIM
   model and DB simulation tool were used to obtain data samples of
   envelope and air conditioning system design parameters, and their life
   cycle carbon emission (LCCE), economic cost (EC) and predicted mean vote
   (PMV). The RF model was used to achieve high precision prediction. The
   GWO was used in the hyper-parameter optimization. The NSGA-II algorithm
   was applied to multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal design
   parameters. A building case shows: (1) The RF model had an excellent
   prediction performance for LCCE, EC and PMV. (2) BIM-DB can be used to
   obtain low error and high reliability building simulation data sets. (3)
   The RF-NSGA-II intelligent algorithm can reduce the LCCE of the building
   in the entire cycle by 16.6\%, reduce the EC per square meter by 2.0\%,
   and greatly improve the thermal comfort by 18.3\%, representing good
   application value. This research provides a way of thinking for the
   multiobjective optimization of green buildings from the perspective of
   data mining and guidance for the parameter selection of the envelopes
   and air conditioning systems of new and existing buildings to more
   scientifically and effectively design green buildings.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current paper is to gain insight in the manner in
   which security is taken into account when building information systems.
   In particular by comparing the concepts of Agile Scrum and DevOps, along
   the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), using Open
   Software Assurance Maturity Model as a measure, and the Lucky Clover
   Model to address the soft-and hard factors, in terms of Content,
   Process, Relation and Culture, which lead to a new framework. The
   initial results based on desk research confirm the general notion of
   there is limited coverage of security in such frameworks. There is only
   partial coverage of security in the DevOps approach and does so
   primarily in the later stages of the SDLC, and it also embraces cultural
   aspects more. Cultural aspects relating to shared value and behavioral
   aspects are not operationalized. Given the impact of security in the
   ever digitalizing society nowadays, the recommendation is that security
   is not just a feature but should be an inherent part of the iterative
   software development approach starting with the Minimal Viable Product
   version. Hence security by design is embraced by the team. Secondly,
   security is not only a technical nor procedural issue. Hence it is not
   only the hard controls (Content and Process) that should be taken into
   account. Also, soft controls (Relations and Culture) should be in
   managerially addressed in a balanced manner.},

Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry comprises
   30\% of the extraction of resources and 25\% of the solid waste. Studies
   have indicated that the adoption of sustainable techniques to lessen
   this environmental impact is being inhibited by demolition waste, the
   lack of standards, and software homogenization. This relates to the
   linear way of using resources, and practices such as circular economy
   (CE) could be a key driver to achieving sustainability. This paper
   presents the material passports (MPs) tool for implementing CE in the
   AEC industry. MPs can provide information about how to assess materials
   at different life-cycle phases and their reuse at their end-of-life
   (EOL). Thus, this paper explores frameworks for deconstruction
   information model (DIM)-based MPs within building information modeling
   (BIM). DIM-based MPs provide information to enhance efficient demolition
   while recognizing valuable materials at the EOL. To achieve this goal, a
   literature review was conducted to understand how BIM could enable the
   use of MPs and what attributes should be addressed. This study aims to
   contribute to the implementation of CE in the AEC industry by developing
   tools that will allow us to understand how to benefit from materials by
   lowering the exploitation of resources for future construction.},

Title = {Tackling uncertainty in life cycle assessments for the built
   environment: A review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {231},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The building and construction sectors contribute around 38\% of global
   energy-related carbon emissions. LCA plays an important role in
   environmental assessments of products and buildings. In some countries,
   assessments are now being required as part of the planning submissions
   for building projects. And existing building environment certifications
   systems, such as BREEAM and LEED, require a form of carbon assessment.
   This has increased the demand for manufacturers to produce environmental
   product declarations (EPDs) to support assessments and design decisions
   at building scale, whilst also being used for product procurement. LCA
   results are often presented as deterministic values and uncertainty is
   often ignored. This is particularly dangerous in the case of comparative
   LCA where, for example, the intention can be to reduce carbon emissions
   by selecting a product or design alternative with a lower footprint.
   This paper reviews the approaches for dealing with uncertainties in LCA
   in general, and in the specific application of LCA to construction
   products and buildings. Buildings are complex and representing this in
   an LCA, which is a model of reality, can be challenging. The largest
   impact savings are achieved during the early stages of design where
   uncertainty and variability in design are high. Therefore, addressing
   and communicating uncertainty here is even more critical. Barriers, such
   as access to uncertainty information in EPDs and the lack of a
   consistent uncertainty procedure, are discussed. Recommendations for
   future improvements include reporting of uncertainty information and
   data quality assessments in EPDs, accessible digitised EPD information
   and integration of uncertainty analysis in building LCA software. As in
   previous reviews, both building carbon assessments and traditional LCA,
   suggest, there needs to be a great improvement in the transparency and
   reporting of assumptions and uncertainties. This applies to both
   products, in the form of EPDs, and building LCA results in academic
   literature and industry reports.},

Title = {Building material reuse: An optimization framework for sourcing new and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {479},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The process of sourcing Reclaimed Construction Materials (RCMs) is
   predominantly manual and hindered by the limited digital presence of
   RCMs. However, the advancing technological landscape provides an
   opportunity to create a modular framework that can assess the value
   proposition of New Construction Materials (NCMs) and RCMs for a project
   before acquiring them. A field study in the Kitchener/Waterloo region
   inspired the development of a framework that has three underlying
   systems encompassing digital tools for data collection and analysis: (1)
   The Real Environment uses 3D scanners and a spreadsheet software, (2)
   The Model Environment uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) software
   and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool, and (3) The Core Engine uses an
   optimization program. Real-world data collected from RCM stores (The
   Habitat for Humanity) and NCM stores (The Home Depot) are used for a
   realistic demonstration of the framework. By practically applying the
   framework to source window and door components for a modeled
   multi-residential building design, an integrated selection of 35\% RCMs
   and 65\% NCMs was proposed for the building design. Furthermore,
   sensitivity analysis is also performed for validation. The framework may
   disrupt the ongoing building design practices that deem material reuse
   problematic by enabling flexible sourcing of used and new building
   materials. A modular and iterative framework for facilitating reuse is
   thus contributed.},

Abstract = {The impact of buildings on the environment, energy consumption and
   climate change is significant, as they use a large amount of resources
   across their life-cycle. Since windows play an important role in the
   overall energy and environmental performance of buildings, emerging
   technologies are focused on the optimization of these building
   components. Among window design technologies, electrochromic (EC)
   devices have received growing interest for their ability to dynamically
   manage the daylight and solar energy entering buildings. Near-infrared
   switching electrochromic (NEC) glazed windows use a novel EC window
   technology that is able to continuously provide high transparency while
   modulating solar heat gains. This study evaluated the manufacturing
   phase of NEC windows to understand if their use phase performance comes
   at acceptable manufacturing burdens. This study also identified which
   constraints are connected to the market shift to the novel technology,
   which can provide the research community with useful information to
   better design the technology as it develops. A comparative
   ``cradle-to-gate{''} energy and emissions analysis was carried out
   between NEC and conventional EC windows.
   The obtained results for the Global Warming Potential of the
   conventional EC device was 85 kg CO2-eq/m(2) and the Cumulative Energy
   Demand was 1680 MJ-eq/m(2). Results for the NEC device were found to be
   50 kg CO2-eq/m(2) and 1050 MJ-eq/m(2), with the reduction primarily due
   to replacing the energy intensive thin film deposition used in
   conventional EC with a solution-based coating process. Finally, when an
   entire window is modeled (EC device, frame, glazing and sealing), the
   difference over conventional EC, in terms of primary energy consumption,
   ranged for the whole window manufacturing from 15\% to 21\%, depending
   on the material of the frame. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A critical review of the use of 3-D printing in the construction
   industry},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {21-31},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {3-D printing, which is an automated production process with
   layer-by-layer control, has been gaining rapid development in recent
   years. The technology has been adopted in the manufacturing industry for
   decades and has recently been introduced in the construction industry to
   print houses and villas. The technology can bring significant benefits
   to the construction industry in terms of increased customization,
   reduced construction time, reduced manpower, and construction cost A few
   isolated products and projects have been preliminarily tested using the
   3-D printing technology. However, it should be noted that such tests and
   developments on the use of 3-D printing in the construction industry are
   very fragmented at the time of the study. It is therefore necessary for
   the building and construction industry to understand the technology, its
   historical applications and challenges for better utilization in the
   future. A systematic review shows that 3-D printing technology, after
   years of evolution, can be used to print large-scale architectural
   models and buildings. However, the potential of the technology is
   limited by the lack of large-scale implementation, the development of
   building information modeling, the requirements of mass customization,
   and the life cycle cost of the printed projects. It is therefore
   expected that future studies should be conducted on these areas to
   consolidate the stability and expand the applicability of 3-D printing
   in the construction industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Environmental Processes Assessment of a Building System Based on
   LCA-Emergy-Carbon Footprint Methodology},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sustainable architecture holds research significance as a necessary
   approach to address climate change. However, the lack of a clear
   definition and diverse research methods present obstacles in this field.
   To overcome these challenges, this study adopts an integrated approach
   that combines ecological and low-carbon aspects and considers the entire
   life cycle system. The highlight of this article is the integration of
   two research methods to assess the sustainability of a building system
   from both ecological and carbon footprint perspectives. This approach
   has not been extensively explored by researchers thus far. The aim is to
   quantitatively explore and evaluate the sustainability performance of
   building systems. The research findings reveal that, among the five life
   cycle stages, the operational stage of a building exhibits the highest
   proportions of emergy consumption and carbon emissions, accounting for
   approximately 89.4\% and 90\%, respectively. From an emergy analysis
   perspective, newly constructed building systems demonstrate qualified
   sustainable parameters (Emergy Sustainability Indicator (ESI) = 2.7 >
   1)). However, as the building system ages and operates over time, the
   overall sustainable parameters gradually decrease, eventually becoming
   unqualified. Furthermore, carbon emissions analysis indicates that total
   carbon emissions accelerate with the aging of the building, highlighting
   the necessity of continuous inputs of material flow, energy flow, and
   information flow to maintain the building system's sustainability. The
   cross-feedback model emerges as the most effective correction method
   among the input processes, although data collection poses a challenge
   due to its nonlinearity. This study provides a fresh perspective for
   architects and building managers, offering insights that contribute to
   mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable practices in the
   built environment.},

Abstract = {Purpose Reuse and recycling building materials depend on an efficient
   set of information and tracking, which can be obtained by the materials
   passport (MP) tool. Although MP introduces principles of circular
   economy (CE) and brings environmental, social and economic benefits, it
   is little-explored in the construction sector. The purpose of this study
   is to explore the adoption of the MP in the sector to raise awareness
   about this tool. This analysis leads to the conception of a model and
   identifies the main challenges and opportunities to increase MP
   implementation in the sector. Design/methodology/approach Through a
   systematic literature review, based on the descriptive and thematic
   analysis, articles were selected, and analyzed to (1) review the MP
   state-of-the-art in the construction sector; (2) propose a materials
   passport model and (3) list the main challenges and opportunities to MP
   adoption. Findings The studies about MP were concentrated on strategies
   to implement general concepts and business opportunities. The MP model
   was proposed to overcome the lack of studies and understanding showed in
   the review. The model aimed to improve the recovery and reuse of
   materials across a building's life cycle. Challenges and opportunities
   were raised to direct decision-makers and support the development of
   this tool. A systematic regulation in the construction value chain and
   policy systems is crucial for creating digital platforms for data
   management of buildings' material. Originality/value This study
   developed an MP model to enable the management of building materials at
   different stages of the building's life cycle and contributes to future
   developments of the studies on this knowledge domain.},

Abstract = {Purpose Food systems are key drivers of environmental impacts, which may
   be assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). Canadian agri-food LCA
   research has been limited by the unavailability of common life cycle
   inventory (LCI) data resources characterizing processes in
   Canadian-specific supply chains. We address this issue through
   identification and evaluation of publicly available Canadian agri-food
   LCI data for possible inclusion in the forthcoming Canadian Agri-food
   Life-Cycle Data Centre (CALDC). Methods A data-reporting template was
   developed based on comparison of the ILCD and ecoSpold2 data-reporting
   formats, which contains all fields required for minimum compliance with
   both formats. Canadian agri-food-related practitioners at academic,
   government and industry organizations were then identified via web and
   literature searches, along with associated, publicly available resources
   containing Canadian agri-food LCI data tables. These data sets were
   classified by process type and geography, and then screened on the basis
   of their reported metadata against the identified reporting template to
   determine which data sets are currently reported in sufficient detail to
   warrant inclusion in the CALDC. This screening focused, in particular on
   metadata, and the identification of potential areas of improvement in
   metadata reporting. Results and discussion The identified data-reporting
   template contained 65 mandatory fields for LCI data, 58 of which related
   to metadata. Identification of available Canadian agri-food LCI data
   sets indicated a high degree of coverage in the field crop sector, and
   the need for significant further development with respect to data in the
   livestock, poultry, dairy, and agricultural support sectors. Screening
   of the data sets against the reporting template indicated that none of
   the identified data sets are currently reported in sufficient detail to
   warrant inclusion in the CALDC. In order to enable their inclusion,
   metadata reporting needs to improve in several areas-in particular, with
   respect to reporting of the percentage of supply represented by the data
   sets, and information regarding critical review of the data sets.
   Conclusions Comparison of ILCD and ecoSpold2 reporting formats yielded a
   data-reporting template, the use of which ensures compliance with both
   formats. Provision of this template will help facilitate
   interoperability between LCI databases and LCA software across all
   sectors. Application to publicly available Canadian agri-food sector
   data indicated that the scope of available LCI data sets in Canada must
   increase in coverage, quantity, and metadata reporting completeness in
   order to adequately support agri-food LCA modelling activities and
   associated sustainability initiatives.},

Abstract = {In an effort to complement energy-efficiency oriented methods of
   environmental building study, this research seeks to understand building
   as a metabolic thermodynamic network, and investigates performance and
   sustainability with system-level principles and biological indicators.
   This approach introduces two system evaluation metrics: (i) solar
   emjoule (sej) of emergy (spelled with an ``m{''}) and (ii) bits of
   information. In this way, emergy-information indicates the intensive
   organization of building energy flux in association with global
   environment development. Findings from a comparative analysis of a
   net-zero energy building (NZEB) and a non-NZEB show that buildings
   increase network complexity, resilience, and adaptability as they reduce
   nonrenewable inputs with energy feedback loops. The consistent tendency
   of maximizing information and complexity at the expense of efficiency
   demonstrates that building thermodynamic networking parallels the
   general ecosystems developmental phenomenon maximum power at optimal
   efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This work presents a Self Sovereign Identity based system proposal to
   show how Blockchain, Building Information Modeling, Internet of Thing
   devices, and Self Sovereign Identity concepts can support the process of
   building digitalization, guaranteeing the compliance standards and

   and traceability of all information produced by stakeholders, or
   generated by IoT devices appropriately placed, during the entire life
   cycle of a building artifact. By exploiting the concepts of the Self
   Sovereign Identity, our proposal allows the identification of all
   involved stakeholders, the storage off-chain of all information, and
   that on-chain of the sole data necessary for the information
   notarization and certification, adopting multi-signature approval
   mechanisms where appropriate. In addition it allows the eligibility
   verification of the certificated information, providing also useful
   information for facility management. It is proposed as an innovative
   system and companies that adopt the Open Innovation paradigm might want
   to pursue it. The model proposal is designed exploiting the Veramo
   platform, hence the Ethereum Blockchain, and all the recommendations

Abstract = {The method of requirements engineering originates from software
   development and describes the process of determining, documenting,
   validating, and managing requirements. The engineering approach in the
   process of identifying requirements offers the possibility to apply the
   systematic and methodical procedure to other branches not related to
   software development. The application of requirements engineering in the
   phase of requirements identification in the context of digital factory
   building models is investigated. In the life cycle phases of a factory
   building, different planners have a need for information from a digital
   building model. In order to identify these information requirements in
   the reconstruction phase of a factory, the method of requirements
   engineering will be used and adapted. The method of identifying and
   prioritizing information requirements adapted for digital building
   models is presented. The traceability of requirements is also integrated
   into the adapted method. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Presold homes refer to houses that are sold before construction has
   begun or while the construction is still underway. To facilitate the
   selection and purchase of houses by clients, construction companies
   usually use sample houses, models, or videos to show the appearance of
   new houses being constructed. Clients have numerous opportunities to
   participate in the spatial planning and spatial allocation of the houses
   because these houses have not yet been constructed, and clients can
   direct the style and materials used for interior partition walls and
   furnishings. However, when discussing housing styles with their clients,
   construction companies often depend on their imagination to create
   three-dimensional images depicting the interior layout of houses.
   Construction companies can neither immediately present new styles when
   clients request changes to partition walls or styles nor estimate the
   costs of the changes. Consequently, clients cannot immediately decide on
   such changes, which then leads to poor communication between the two
   parties. Accordingly, this study designed a system that integrates
   building information modeling (BIM) and virtual reality (VR). Through
   this system, clients can change and immediately view house styles in
   immersive VR and decide on whether the changes meet their demands.
   Furthermore, the designed system is linked to a unit price database for
   materials. When clients make alterations in the system, it automatically
   calculates the costs of the changes and then helps the client determine
   whether the changes are within their budgets. The results of this study
   indicate that the designed system can accurately and rapidly achieve
   cost estimation. Furthermore, the proposed system ensures consistency
   between BIM and virtual environment information, thereby promoting the
   application of BIM in the stages of a building life cycle subsequent to
   building design.},

Abstract = {Design for deconstruction (DfD) increases reusable components extracted
   from old structures by considering the ease of deconstruction from a

   methods for evaluating DfD performance, quantifying the benefits of DfD
   for practical application is difficult. This study proposes a tool based
   on building information modeling for DfD to provide automated DfD
   performance eval-uation results that include the mathematical evaluation
   score, CO2 emission, and cost. To validate the tool, we conducted a case
   study, assuming a steel structure design. Accordingly, it enables the
   development of decon-struction options and designs that reduce CO2
   emissions and costs by up to 40.1\% and 1.3\%, respectively, when
   compared to initial alternatives. Reuse can reduce CO2 emissions and
   costs that increase per the deconstruction options. The study highlights
   the importance of analyzing the environmental load and cost of various
   decon-struction options that have been excluded from previous studies.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a practical approach that can
   manage the construction projects' life cycle activities and be used by
   the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) to ensure the
   excellent quality of the projects, reduce cost and facilitate
   communication among contractor players. The development of the BIM uses
   in the construction industry has widely spread in many countries,
   unfortunately not in Malaysia even though it started in Malaysia since
   2004. Several universities worldwide offer BIM courses in their program,
   while many others are under the process of integrating BIM into their
   curricula. Most of the universities lack the realization of the
   importance of BIM application, BIM teaching strategy, and plans to
   overcome the barriers to integration of BIM into the curriculum. This
   paper presents the current state of BIM education in the engineering
   program in the Faculty of Civil Engineering (FCE) as a case study. A
   detailed literature review and questionnaire survey performed for this
   purpose, followed by statistical analysis. The research presented the
   status of BIM education in FCE and formulated a framework that will
   provide guidelines for those universities which are not currently
   implementing BIM or just started developing BIM curriculum. More
   practical project-based class assignments that supported students with
   learning how to apply different formal project management methods to
   real-world project management problems will be adapt. The program in the
   universities will be able to produce graduates who are equipped with the
   necessary knowledge and skills of modern tools such as BIM before they
   enter into their professional careers.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop the four-node-based finite element model for
   estimating the techno-economic performance of the building-integrated
   photovoltaic blind (FEM4-nodeEIPB), which can be used by decision-maker
   in the early design phase. In developing the proposed model, this study
   uses various research methodologies such as energy simulation, finite
   element method, life cycle cost analysis, policy analysis, and visual
   basic application. Compared to the simulation results, the mean absolute
   percentage error of the proposed model was determined to be 4.54\%,
   showing that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model was found to
   be excellent. Furthermore, the practical application was conducted for
   the `S' elementary school facility in South Korea, which allows
   potential readers to easily and clearly understand the operating
   mechanism of the proposed model as well as its usability and
   extendability. The proposed model can be used to conduct the detailed
   analysis of the techno-economic performance of the BIPB by the type of
   utilization plan and to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing
   the value of the investment. Furthermore, the proposed research
   framework can be extended to any other technology, industry, and country
   in the global environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The second recommendation of the working group 2.14 ``Digitalization in

   respect to the life cycle of the specialized model subsoil. Furthermore,
   the minimum requirements regarding the implementation of geometrical and

   consequent use of the specialized model subsoil in context with BIM it
   is necessary to standardize the data with respect to the model level as
   well as the object level by means of properties which have to be
   defined. These recommendations describe the essential requirements for
   standardized geotechnical properties which still have to be developed.
   Therefore, data-related requirements for creation as well as the
   attribution of the specialized model subsoil are discussed.},

Abstract = {BIM promises improvement in project delivery efficiencies such as
   reduction in costs and errors and timely completion. Benefits are also
   expected in sustainable construction aspect with research efforts being
   extended to sustainable design and assessment. These efforts are still
   been explored for the purposes of unifying quantification methodologies,
   the standardization of system boundaries, terms of references and
   sustainability measures. Embodied energy and CO2 are two common measures
   that have been widely used in the construction sector. Although a number
   calculation system exists, they are not useful to the iterations that
   occur at the early project life cycle stages. At the procurement stage,
   professionals often rely on schedules and bill of quantities with no
   reference to sustainability credentials. It is therefore important to
   integrate sustainability measure with concepts in standard measurement
   methods. As such, we propose a framework to integrate sustainability
   credential with the concepts in rule of building measurement. We
   conclude that this framework can be applicable to any rule of building
   measurement and it is implementable in a computer programmable
   environment.},

Title = {BIM-based energy consumption assessment of the on-site construction of
   building structural systems},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-14},

Abstract = {Purpose Steel and reinforced concrete are among the most common
   structural materials used in the construction industry. Cost and the
   speed of construction have been usually the main criteria when selecting
   a building's structural system, whereby the environmental impact of the
   structural material is sometimes ignored. Availability of an easy-to-use
   tool for environmental assessment of the structural alternatives could
   encourage this evaluation in the decision making. The purpose of this
   paper is to introduce an automated tool for the environmental assessment
   of the on-site construction processes of a building structural system,
   which calculates the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the
   structural system as a parameter for comparison.
   Design/methodology/approach This assessment tool is implemented using a
   building information modeling (BIM) platform to extract structural
   elements and their key attributes, such as type, geometrical and
   locational data. These data are processed together with a productivity
   database to calculate machine hours, and then predefined energy and
   carbon inventories are used to assess the energy consumption of the
   structural system in the erection/installation stage. Findings This
   assessment tool provides an automated and easy-to-use approach to
   estimate energy consumption and carbon emissions of different structural
   systems that are modeled in a BIM platform. The results of this tool
   were within the ranges reported by the available studies.
   Originality/value This research project presents a novel approach to use
   BIM-based attributes of the structural elements to calculate the
   required efforts, i.e. machine hours, and assess their energy
   consumption and carbon emissions during construction processes.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To address environmental challenges, the Architecture, Engineering,
   Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry, which is known for its
   high resource consumption and waste production, needs to switch to a
   circular economy (CE). This approach focuses on reducing, recycling, and
   reusing materials to narrow, slow, and close material loops. However,
   one of the main problems which the AECO industry is still facing is the
   lack of common, standardized, and automated procedures to consider the
   recyclability and presence of hazardous materials. To address this
   problem, this study focuses on extending the recyclability rate from the
   material to building scale, considering the presence of hazardous
   materials based on the European Waste Catalogue (EWC), hence defining a
   new KPI. It adopts Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFCs) and integrates them with bespoke programming
   in Python to develop a standardized and automated procedure that
   complies with Italian regulations. The new KPI will help clients and
   designers to rate the overall recyclability of a building and to choose
   the best combination of materials and components. The procedure includes
   data acquisition, transmission, and data/model integration, resulting in
   practical and trackable measures that could be globally scalable.
   Scenario analyses are also developed to consider the impact of
   maintenance attitude on waste production.},

Abstract = {BIM modeling technologies are gradually becoming mandatory and necessary
   in a life cycle of a building or structure. The main difference between
   BIM and other types of design is the collection and comprehensive
   processing of all architectural, technological, economic, operational
   and other information about the building in a single informational
   environment. Moreover, all elements of the model are interconnected and
   interdependent, which ensures the maximum proximity of the model to the
   real situation. The advantages of BIM technology for cultural heritage
   sites are operational guidance and quality control of restoration and
   construction works, minimizing the probability of errors in projects,
   cost reduction and optimization at operation phase. Technological scheme
   of highprecision information modeling of cultural heritage objects
   includes data acquisition, modelling of structural elements and
   accumulation of attributive information in a specialized software
   environment, quality control, visualization. The data acquisition stage
   is based on analysis of existing data and documentation, executive
   surveys. For this purpose, terrestrial laser scanning is a perfect
   surveying tool due to its speed, accuracy, completeness of data and
   level of detail. The difficulty of determining the technical
   characteristics of the elements and their physical properties, can be
   partially solved with excessive information provided from laser
   scanning, and the complexity of modeling deformations and deviations,
   restricts the level of development and detail (LOD) of the BIM model but
   define use of mixed LOD (LOD200-500) for a cultural heritage object. The
   factors that determine the LOD of BIM modeling are: the current state of
   the object, surveying accessibility, availability of documentation etc.
   Considering such modeling features provides the creation of a
   informational model that determines the functionality of the object, in
   respect with its cultural, historical and architectural value.},

Abstract = {The use of building information modeling (BIM) for infrastructures is on
   the rise but the use of the life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) integrated
   within the BIM environment itself to analyze multiple design
   alternatives and set up a proper maintenance plan has not yet been
   developed. It is possible to integrate evaluation of maintenance and
   waste recovery strategies, minimizing costs and the use of raw
   materials. A visual programming tool was exploited to set up an
   application that applies the LCCA methodology to a road pavement project
   in the early design phase, returning the total maintenance cost updated
   to the year of construction, the number of maintenance interventions,
   and the residual value of accumulated fatigue damage. The execution of
   the LCCA tool dynamically updates the properties of the BIM model with
   the resulting pavement management plan and returns multiple outputs,
   giving to the user the possibility of making further assessments and
   store the data as needed. The developed application shows that BIM is a
   promising tool to implement more complex and useful analyses that can
   reduce the maintenance planning time and allow the designer to choose
   between multiple alternative solutions already in the early design
   phase, bringing consistent cost savings through the possibility of
   finding the minimum cost solution based on the specific project needs in
   compliance with the quality and safety criteria to be guaranteed for the
   road category.},

Title = {Seascape connectivity: ontogenetic migration for <i>Haemulon
   flavolineatum</i>},
Journal = {REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {In the seascape, species migrate between ecosystems to complete their
   life cycles, and such ontogenetic migrations create functional
   connections between ecosystems. Nevertheless, the scarcity of
   information on patch distribution, species life history and ecology
   limits its application in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) management. We
   use a potential connectivity network approach to analyze how Haemulon
   flavolineatum might move through a complex and diverse seascape by
   simulating part of its life cycle migrations among three ecosystems
   (reef, mangrove, and seagrass) in the MPA of Bahia Portete-Kaurrele
   (BPK), Colombia. We used available ecosystem cover maps to conduct
   habitat fragmentation analyses and evaluate structural connectivity in
   BPK using eight indices that describe ecosystem patches and how they are
   related. With published information on the H. flavolineatum home range
   and its ontogenetic migration distances, we estimated the potential
   functional connectivity (CONNECT and migration distances) between
   ecosystems by building bipartite graphs. The benthic habitat
   configuration of the BPK could allow Haemulon flavolineatum to complete
   at least two stages of its life cycle (stage 5 mangroves to reefs being
   more likely than stage 4 seagrass to mangroves). Ontogenetic migrations
   is possible since, patches of different ecosystems were highly
   intermixed (76\%) rather than grouped (58\%); reefs showed higher values
   of structural indices (patch area, largest patch, shape complexity,
   functional links) than mangrove (shortest distance to the nearest
   neighbor) and seagrass (representativeness); and juveniles migrate from
   mangroves to reef patches along the bay, but they could be isolated by
   distance when moving from particular seagrass to mangrove patches. Our
   methodological approach, which integrates ecological information
   (evidence-based ranges of species migration distances between habitat
   patches) and the seascape (spatial configuration of habitat patches and
   fragmentation) is novel for a marine fish species with ontogenetic
   migration to search for the likelihood of completing its life cycle
   stages. We discuss the need for ecological information on French grunts
   and the need to validate future models and scenarios.},

Title = {An Integrated BIM-IoT Framework for Real-Time Quality Monitoring in
   Construction Site},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Effective quality management is essential for ensuring construction
   quality, adhering to schedules, and controlling costs. The application
   of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for quality control during the
   construction phase presents challenges, particularly with the real-time
   monitoring and tracing of onsite quality data. In response, we propose a
   framework that integrates Internet of Things (IoT)-based quality data
   with four-dimensional (4D) BIM for enhanced quality monitoring and
   acceptance. This framework includes (1) automatic segmentation of 4D
   BIM, (2) collection and mapping of quality data, and (3) real-time
   monitoring and assessment of quality. We validated our framework in a
   large-scale building project in Wuhan, China, focusing on concrete
   engineering quality acceptance. The results demonstrate that our
   integrated framework effectively captures and integrates live quality
   data in real-time into 4D BIM models for ongoing monitoring and
   assessment. The contribution of our research lays the foundation for the
   development of an integrated BIM-IoT framework for real-time quality
   monitoring, improving its efficiency and accuracy during quality
   acceptance in construction.
   This study presents a practical solution for real-time quality
   monitoring and acceptance at construction sites through the integration
   of 4D Building Information Modeling with IoT technologies. By
   facilitating real-time quality monitoring and data capture, the
   framework significantly enhances decision-making processes. Construction
   managers can use this system to promptly detect and resolve quality
   issues, thereby reducing rework costs and likelihood. Additionally, this
   integrated framework ensures compliance with stringent quality
   standards, providing a reliable method to meet all construction project
   specifications. The capability to continuously update the 4D BIM model
   with live data enables dynamic resource management and optimizing
   workerpower. Consequently, this approach leads to improved project
   outcomes, higher-quality buildings, and greater client satisfaction. In
   a case study involving a large-scale high-rise building project, the
   framework demonstrated its effectiveness by integrating live quality
   data into 4D BIM for ongoing monitoring and acceptance. The results
   underscored the framework's potential to provide stakeholders with
   timely information and implement corrective actions, significantly
   enhancing the efficiency and reliability of construction quality
   acceptance.},

Abstract = {While initial costs in building economics cover a small portion of the
   costs incurred during its life cycle, most occur in construction,
   operation, and subsequent processes. Despite its numerous contributions
   to building economics, the construction industry is slowly adapting to
   digital technologies. To overcome the barriers and crown the assets with
   their proper management, dynamic applications of digital tools and
   techniques of Industry 4.0 need to emerge in the construction industry.
   Therefore, this study aims to present an integrative approach that
   combines quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques to critically
   review the available literature on the potential contributions of
   digital construction technologies to building economics through the
   post-design phases of the life cycle. The primary focus of the
   investigation is how digital technologies can overcome prevalent
   problems and how they can impact building economics. The study
   contributes to the field by providing an awareness that will inform
   researchers and practitioners of the trends, gaps, and more profound
   exchange of ideas in future research efforts.},

Abstract = {Photovoltaic system is a technology for the production of electricity
   from renewable sources that is rapidly expanding thanks to its
   capability to reduce the energy consumption from traditional sources and
   to decrease the air pollution. During the operational phase, there are
   no emissions and the only input is represented by solar power. However,
   it should be noted that, considering the entire life cycle of a plant,
   photovoltaic systems, like any other means of electricity production,
   give rise to emissions, that focus especially in the manufacturing stage
   and installation of components.
   The present work aims at evaluating the environmental impact, and
   therefore the actual sustainability of this technology, examining a
   ground-mounted 1778.48 kW(p) photovoltaic plant, realized by
   TerniEnergia S.p.A. and located in Marsciano (Perugia, Italy). The
   analysis is conducted using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA), which allows to consider all stages of the life cycle, from the
   extraction of raw materials to the plant's disposal ({''}from a cradle
   to grave perspective{''}). In particular, the study takes into account
   the soil preparation, the installation of fence and electrical
   substations of low and medium voltage, the mounting of support
   structures, also with reference to hot dip galvanizing process, the
   production of modules, their installation, the wiring apparatus and the
   network connection. The transport of all components to the installation
   site is considered for each stage that is examined. The end of life
   scenario of the plant is also evaluated. The possibility to collect many
   detailed information in the construction site, during the building
   phase, adds value to the study. The analysis is carried out according to
   UNI EN ISO 14040 and UNI EN ISO 14044, which regulate the LCA procedure.
   The LCA modelling was performed using SimaPro software application and
   using Eco Indicator 99 methodology. The results of the analysis allows
   to calculate some important parameters like EPBT (Energy Pay-Back Time),
   EROEI (Energy Return on Energy Invested), CO2 emissions and GWP100
   (Global Warming Potential). Finally, the environmental impact of
   photovoltaic plant is compared to that of some traditional energy
   production systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Factors Influencing BIM Adoption for Construction Enterprises in China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {The construction industry is one of the important pillars of the Chinese
   national economy. BIM, as a new information technology tool, provides an
   intelligent digital representation of buildings to support diverse
   activities and brings about a wide range of benefits throughout the life
   cycle of projects. However, BIM has not been widely adopted in
   construction enterprises in China. It is necessary to make a
   comprehensive and systematic analysis of the influencing factors for BIM
   adoption. This paper sums up 13 influencing factors from four aspects,
   namely, technology, economy, institution, and environment aspect. The
   questionnaire survey and statistical analysis were used to collect and
   process data which is applied to determine the influencing factors.
   Based on relevant literature, a hypothesis model was established by the
   structural equation modeling method. SPSS software and AMOS software
   were used to test the model. Then, the key factors influencing BIM
   adoption are induced. The results show that the key factors that
   influence BIM adoption in China include personnel quality, investment in
   personnel training, BIM standardization, and the influence of senior
   managers in the organization. Combined with the above conclusion, this
   paper puts forward some suggestions for promoting BIM adoption and
   specific measures to realize the wide application of BIM technology in
   the Chinese construction industry.},

   Structural Equation Modelling Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The construction sector is one of Yemen's most important economic
   pillars. Building information modelling (BIM) is a new information
   technology implementation that can create an intelligent digital design
   of buildings to support a variety of tasks and provides a wide range of
   benefits throughout the project life cycle. However, BIM is not widely
   embraced in Yemeni construction firms. Compared with other countries,
   Yemen presents a unique case for BIM adoption due to the ongoing war in
   the country, which will assist in rapid rebuilding processes. Thus, a
   complete and systematic investigation of the factors affecting BIM
   adoption in the Yemeni construction industry is required. This study
   utilises five categories of impacting factors: Technology, Process,
   Policy, People, and the Environment to model the strategic
   implementation for BIM in the Yemeni construction industry. A random
   sample was used to achieve homogeneity and increase the consistency and
   quality of data. Purposive sampling was used to choose participants for
   the framework validation. The data were analysed using partial least
   squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), and the key factors
   influencing BIM adoption were determined and modelled. The results show
   multivariate results indicate a high correlation within the measurement
   model for all factors affecting BIM adoption in Yemen. In addition, the
   developed model was deemed to fit because the analysis result of the
   model's coefficient of determination test (R-2) is BIM adoption having
   0.437, Environment at 0.589, and People having 0.310, demonstrating high
   acceptance. Moreover, the results reveal a high correlation between
   policy and people (>0.50), while the environment significantly affected
   BIM adoption (0.304). Overall, the model illustrated how various factors
   influence BIM adoption. The created framework highlights the importance
   of understanding BIM adoption concepts and challenges in the Yemeni
   construction industry. It is believed that this study highlights the BIM
   implementation in developing countries such as Yemen and the possibility
   of implementing the proposed method in other countries to develop their
   own BIM implementation strategy.},

Abstract = {Critical decisions about whether and how to integrate sustainability
   measures into the life cycle activities of green buildings are made in
   the early architectural design phase. To this end, researchers have
   advocated the use of various green building simulation technologies
   (GBSTs) to perform sustainability analyses to support integrated
   architectural design processes, cross-disciplinary communications, and
   evidence-based decision making. However, the adoption of GBSTs in
   architectural design practices remains limited. Building on the
   technology acceptance model, this paper investigates the determinants
   and mechanisms that influence the adoption of GBSTs in practice.
   Empirical data collected from architectural designers in Taiwan through
   qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey show that perceived
   usefulness is a strong predictor of designers' intentions to adopt
   GBSTs. Job relevance, result demonstrability, compatibility, and
   competitive advantage are also important determinants of GBST adoption.
   Practical recommendations are offered to encourage greater adoption of
   GBSTs in architectural design practices. Theoretically, this research
   extends the technology adoption literature in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) industry by broadening and deepening
   the understanding of context-specific determinants of GBST adoption.},

Title = {Building Construction Information System Using GIS},

Abstract = {The stages of building construction vary with respect to activities and
   procedures. Execution schedules and two-dimensional (2D) drawings are
   commonly used to identify hazards in construction. Geographic
   information systems (GISs) can provide stakeholders, construction
   engineers and contractors with the required data during building
   construction. Planners can visualise 2D drawings and three-dimensional
   (3D) models using a GIS model that logically links their components with
   the activities in the schedule to establish the construction sequence.
   This study suggests the use of a GIS in building information modelling
   to construct a building construction information system by integrating
   2D drawings and 3D models with the activities database in the GIS model.
   GIS modelling can be used to generate and update schedules, databases
   and geospatial analyses within a single platform, which is a major
   requirement in the construction industry. Combining a GIS model in
   construction with its surrounding topography by linking 2D drawings and
   databases of activities or components of a building can produce a safe
   execution sequence. If a hazardous situation is identified during the
   analytical review process, it can be prevented within the GIS platform
   prior to the actual implementation. If defects are identified during and
   after construction, the cause of the defects and suitable mitigation can
   be determined. The methodology is tested using a real-life project in
   Riyadh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results conclude that GIS
   modelling can be employed to establish an information system for all
   stages of building construction and to create an archived system for
   efficient project documentation.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The emergence of Digital Twin (DT) technology presents unique
   opportunities for society by facilitating real-time data transfer from
   the physical environment to its digital counterpart. Although progress
   has been made in various industry sectors such as aerospace, the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) sector
   still requires further advancements, like the adoption of these
   technologies over traditional approaches. The use of these technologies
   should become standard practice rather than an advanced operation. This
   paper aims to address the existing gap by presenting a comprehensive
   framework that integrates technologies and concepts derived from
   purpose-driven case studies and research studies across different
   industries. The framework is designed to provide best practices for the
   AECO sector. Moreover, it aims to underscores the potential of DT for
   optimization through overseeing and digital management of the built
   environment across the entire life cycle of facilities, encompassing
   design, construction, operation, and maintenance. It is based on an
   extensive literature review and presents a holistic approach to
   outlining the roles of Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other key
   enablers within the DT environment. These digital tools facilitating the
   simultaneous evaluation of associated benefits, such as resource savings
   and future prospects, like monitoring project sustainability objectives.},

Abstract = {The modeling of land use impacts on biodiversity is considered a
   priority in life cycle assessment (LCA). Many diverging approaches have
   been proposed in an expanding literature on the topic. The UNEP/SETAC
   Life Cycle Initiative is engaged in building consensus on a shared
   modeling framework to highlight best-practice and guide model
   application by practitioners. In this paper, we evaluated the
   performance of 31 models from both the LCA and the ecology/conservation
   literature (20 from LCA, 11 from non-LCA fields) according to a set of
   criteria reflecting (i) model completeness, (ii) biodiversity
   representation, (iii) impact pathway coverage, (iv) scientific quality,
   and (v) stakeholder acceptance. We show that LCA models tend to perform
   worse than those from ecology and conservation (although not
   significantly), implying room for improvement. We identify seven
   best-practice recommendations that can be implemented immediately to
   improve LCA models based on existing approaches in the literature. We
   further propose building a ``consensus model{''} through weighted
   averaging of existing information, to complement future development.
   While our research focuses on conceptual model design, further
   quantitative comparison of promising models in shared case studies is an
   essential prerequisite for future informed model choice.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the growing survey capability for continuous and
   frequent inspections of road pavement conditions has raised questions
   regarding the optimal solutions for data management. Considering
   traditional approaches, classical Pavement Management Systems seem
   inadequate for exploiting the potential of similar data, especially for
   visualization and infrastructure modelling. The development of BIM
   procedures may be helpful although the existing solutions are not ready
   for handling road condition and maintenance management. Furthermore, the
   recent international regulations gradually adopt BIM in all
   infrastructure projects, as reference model. Then, as a preliminary
   approach, in this paper, a solution for presenting and elaborating
   pavement condition information in an I-BIM environment is proposed. This
   procedure simplifies representation and elaboration of survey
   information regarding structural and functional conditions of pavements
   in a realistic 3D environment, exploiting smart object potential.
   Specific routines have been coded for upgrading and elaborating specific
   extended attributes related to pavement condition. This approach
   represents an important evolution compared to traditional methodologies,
   as a modern and `user-friendly' decision support tool for road agencies,
   combining in a single environment all the life cycle phases of the
   infrastructure. The proposed approach has been tested, in a preliminary
   form, on an existing motorway, with positive results.},

Abstract = {Compared to other industries, the built environment is still the largest
   and one of the least efficient consumers of resources. Existing measures
   and procedures for resource recovery and reuse are focused on the
   demolition phase, when the composition of materials and structures is
   mostly unknown and hard to be analysed. Therefore, these measures are
   somewhat inefficient for overall high-rate material recovery. The
   enhancement of the integrated semantic planning process by the
   introduction of the IFC unified data standard and BIM technology is a
   first-time opportunity to track, analyse, document and simulate all
   relevant players, parameters and processes with an impact on the
   resource and material efficiency through the entire life cycle of a
   building in the design phase of a building project. The presented work
   explores the potential of IFC to serve as a framework for achieving a
   higher material efficiency in the built environment. A proposed design
   check approach for the simulation and optimisation of material
   efficiency in a building over its life cycle is based on a system of key
   parameters and actions organised in logic trees. The parameters and
   actions are translated into IFC objects. Additionally required IFC
   objects and properties are identified and described.},

Title = {A new method for calculating the embodied carbon emissions from
   buildings in schematic design: Taking ``building element{''} as basic
   unit},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the schematic design stage, accounting for the embodied carbon
   emissions (ECEs) from buildings during design optimization is
   indispensable for saving energy and reducing emissions from the source.
   Since the traditional inventory analysis method is more widely applied
   in the mature construction drawing design stage or with a detailed bill
   of quantities, developing a method suitable to provide design feedback
   during the schematic design stage is urgently needed. The key issues of
   the method that need to be solved are the lack of design information and
   the difficulty in obtaining quantities. To address the limitations, this
   paper proposes a BIM-based calculation method that takes the ``building
   element{''} (BE) as the basic unit, and the accuracy is verified by a
   frame-structure case study. For this method, it is imperative to create
   carbon emission factors (CEFs) of the BEs as the basis of calculation
   combined with the quantities extracted from the model schedules by
   encoding, which can significantly contribute to the calculation. The
   results show that this method has good accuracy and high efficiency and
   can identify potential hotspots of ECEs, which conforms to design
   process and habits and provides design feedback function for carbon
   emission reduction (CER). At the schematic design stage, the application
   of this method can quantitatively evaluate the ECEs and optimize the
   design from the BE level so that the concept of low carbon design can be
   truly put into practice and the energy savings and emission reductions
   of buildings can be controlled as early as possible.},

Abstract = {The current discussions concerning the method of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) are driven by visionary and idealistic approaches. The
   emphasis is placed on the opportunities offered by the model-based
   documentation and exchange of project data in the entire project life
   cycle. On the one hand this vision is important, because only the
   promotion of numerous advantages of alternative und collaborative
   methods will lead to a necessary change in the construction industry. On
   the other hand these big pictures of future project realisation methods
   leave the impression that those ideas have nothing in common with the
   actual situation in construction projects. However especially general
   contractors try to benefit from the use of digital methods and generate
   own 3D-models for the cost estimation - independent of existing
   structures. In this report the current practice of a modelbased tender
   phase will be described to emphasise the special view oft he
   construction companies and the resulting advantages. Finally two ways to
   ensure a consistent digital chain are briefly described.},

Abstract = {In the evolving field of civil engineering studies, a significant
   transition is evident from fundamental to new-generation research
   approaches. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at
   analyzing these shifts, focusing specifically on the performance of
   students in educational buildings thought the integration of modern
   technologies such as the Internet of Things, life cycle assessments, and
   building information modeling. Covering the literature from the late
   twentieth century to the early twenty-first century, the review
   emphasizes advancements in sustainable infrastructure, eco-friendly
   designs, digitalization, and advanced modeling. A comparative analysis
   reveals that while the fundamental articles are primarily focused on
   indoor air quality parameters, the new-generation articles prioritize
   technological integration to address broader environmental concerns and
   for improved building performance. Challenges in the education sector,
   such as insufficient energy use, high maintenance costs, and poor
   working conditions, are also discussed, showcasing their impact on
   student learning outcomes. The methodology employed for this review
   included a comprehensive search in databases such as Scopus and Web of
   Science, using keywords such as ``school buildings{''}, ``IoT{''},
   ``BIM{''}, and ``LCA{''}, ensuring a robust and diverse collection of
   academic articles. The findings show that new trends supplement existing
   topics, suggesting an integration rather than a replacement of
   traditional practices. Consequently, future research efforts will need
   to include a broader range of information to fully account for the
   evolving landscape in this field.},

Abstract = {The developments of the latest technology in the field of Digital
   Cultural Heritage (DCH) are revolutionizing the methods of surveying,
   representing and managing the built heritage. The integrated use of 3D
   survey instruments such as laser scanning, digital photogrammetry and
   the new holistic way to represent the architecture, based on the
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), allows the collection, analysis and
   archiving of a large amount of data, by increasing information sharing
   among a great number of experts involved during the life cycle of the
   building. The paper focuses on the connection between Italy and Czech in
   terms of vaults patterns and construction techniques. The two case
   studies are the frame vault of the chapel of the Italian Cultural
   Institute and the barrel vault with lunettes of the Klementinum Baroque
   Library. They are both unique examples of the great expertise of
   architects and craftsmen that worked in Bohemia across the 17th and 18th
   centuries. Most of them were from the North of Italy, like the ones that
   worked in the building sites of the two case studies. The in-depth study
   of the construction techniques and the complex shapes needs the use of
   new scan-to-BIM modeling requirements, based on the definition of
   geometric primitives useful for the generation of intelligent
   three-dimensional models able to integrate different types of data.
   Finally, the acquired data are included in a database that collects
   information coming from both Italian and Czech studies, raising
   awareness among citizens of the richness of their built heritage.},

Abstract = {Daylight analysis and optimization are pre-requisites for
   energy-efficient and sustainable infrastructure. Conventional practices
   of designing and providing artificial lighting often ignore the
   consideration of the availability of natural daylight for the
   infrastructure. This paper aims to analyze the availability and
   potential of natural daylight reviewing the sky component type at a
   designated location, real-time sensor-based illuminance measurement
   on-site and BIM-based daylight simulation. Consequently, a sensor
   prototype was deployed to the metro rail station for automated
   optimization. Firstly, the sky component type of Ahmedabad was
   determined based on the literature review. Subsequently, sensors were
   integrated at the strategic grid point location covering the entire
   metro rail station to collect real-time Illuminance for daylight factor
   calculation. Furthermore, BIM-based sun path and shadow analysis and
   daylight simulation were carried out to suggest the possibility and
   potential of daylight savings. Finally, based on all the analysis and
   results, a newly designed sensor-based prototype was developed and
   equipped to enhance automated optimization for daylight savings, which
   resulted in 29\% energy savings monthly. This approach significantly
   helps the project stakeholders to enhance building energy performance

Abstract = {Many hazards fail to be recognized on construction projects because of
   the complex and dynamic nature of construction environments, resulting
   in life-threatening accidents and fatalities. Researchers and safety
   experts have attempted to identify potential safety hazards using
   emerging technologies. In particular, building information modeling
   (BIM) has attracted considerable attention due to its ability to
   increase cooperation between all stakeholders involved in a construction
   project in order to reduce safety issues. Given the importance of BIM in
   improving hazard recognition as the first step in the process of safety
   programs, there is a shortage of systematic reviews of this necessary
   safety factor. In response to this need, this paper explored the impact
   of BIM on hazard recognition skills. To fulfill this purpose, two
   databases were examined, and related articles were reviewed. The
   research papers selected for this study were categorized based on the
   specific phase of construction. This categorization aimed to determine
   which phases in the overall life cycle of construction have been
   predominantly examined, as well as identify the phases that require more
   effort in hazard recognition using BIM. Furthermore, the findings
   provide insights into the most effective methodologies for each
   construction phase, which is summarized for easier access by
   researchers. The systematic review results provided a reference for
   safety management in the construction industry to reduce the number of
   workplace accidents using an established technology.},

   Green Pyramid Rating System},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Green construction management is an approach that aims to promote
   sustainable solutions in building design and construction. However, the
   complexity and variability in design scenarios often pose challenges to
   implementing these practices effectively. This study proposes a
   collaborative framework for green construction management that leverages
   automated and semi-automated simulations to facilitate performance-based
   decision making. The framework utilizes the green pyramid rating system
   (GPRS) as a third-party certification assessment provider. It employs
   various BIM analysis software tools, including Dynamo codes in Autodesk
   Revit and add-in plug-ins using Revit API, to extract information and
   parameters from the BIM model. The data are used to perform quantitative
   calculations and comprehensive analysis that aid decision makers in
   investigating, analyzing, improving, and assessing sustainability
   aspects throughout the project. The proposed framework enables a
   structured approach to green construction management that incorporates
   the building variable consecutive level of details/development (LOD) and
   life cycle phases. A case study of an office building in the new
   administrative capital in Egypt demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   framework in promoting sustainable solutions. The collaborative
   framework for interoperability design decisions proposed in this study
   provides a valuable tool for implementing green construction management
   practices. The use of automated and semi-automated simulations,
   following the GPRS, helps to ensure that sustainable solutions are
   advocated, interrogated, and refined throughout the project. The
   framework's structured approach enables decision makers to investigate,
   analyze, improve, and assess sustainability aspects effectively.},

Abstract = {The recent developments of road pavement survey technologies guarantee
   acquisition of detailed data regarding the main functional and
   structural indicators, at a very high frequency and levels of accuracy
   and precision unconceivable few years ago. The relevant information,
   regarding surface distresses too, is thus available in economical,
   high-speed and high-resolution forms, with limited disturbance on
   traffic and road agencies issues. However, the availability of such a
   mass of data poses interesting questions concerning the most efficient
   processing and analysis methods, for optimizing maintenance operation
   planning. Unfortunately, the PMS adoption is not very common and
   widespread, as they are significantly complicated and sophisticated,
   with critical consequences in their actual and intense practical use.
   Then, there is a need of simplifying the pavement maintenance process,
   by defining smart tools actually supporting the operators in the
   analysis and decisional phases. BIM (Building Information Modeling)
   procedures can absolutely represent a strategical solution. Indeed, BIM
   models, already widely adopted in the structural fields, have been
   recently introduced in the infrastructural design phases, simplifying
   the entire life-cycle of the construction, with representation clarity,
   mistake reduction, and money savings. However, although the BIM
   advantages have been significantly exploited in the design phases,
   pavement maintenance has not been directly involved in the BIM
   processes. Then, this paper focuses on a methodological analysis of the
   problem, aiming to propose a novel BIM-based approach for managing
   pavement maintenance. The goal is to define proper ``smart objects{''},
   based on specific relational databases, that may represent a more
   suitable instrument for handling pavement condition and quality
   information, in a user-friendly software environment. The potentialities
   of the modern survey technologies may be integrated and optimized in a
   BIM process, involving in parallel both design and maintenance.},

Abstract = {Application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the AEC
   industry has been evolving. With new developments and increasing
   capabilities, BIM is reshaping the design, construction, and operation,
   and maintenance processes and revolutionizing the entire functions of
   building life cycles. To maximize BIM benefits and take advantage of its
   capabilities, it is imperative that project stakeholders define specific
   roles and responsibilities within projects; to employ professionals with
   high levels of BIM proficiency, expertise, and knowledge. This study
   aims to classify the construction firms into different clusters based on
   their BIM capabilities, implementation, BIM levels, and type of BIM
   roles they employ for construction projects. It will further predict and
   classify BIM levels at company level according to its usage. The
   methodology was based on a survey design which consisted of application
   an online questionnaire that was distributed to AEC professionals in the
   industry. 61 suitable responses were analysed, using different
   supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including
   Cluster Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (k-NN), Random Forest,
   and Gradient Boosting. The findings showed most firms were not applying
   BIM on their projects and the majority of those that did were not
   utilizing it in its full potential. Firms were further classified in
   terms of BIM levels and types of BIM applications they utilize on
   construction projects. The results showed that Random Forest had the
   highest performance and the most accuracy, comparing with KNN and
   Gradient Boosting, even though the performance and predictions results
   produced by all models were in proximity of one another.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling is growing more relevant as digital models
   are not only used during the construction phase but also throughout the
   building's life cycle. The digital representation of geometric, physical
   and functional properties enables new methods for planning, execution
   and operation. Digital models of existing buildings are commonly derived
   from surveying data such as laser scanning which needs to be processed
   either manually or automatically throughout various steps. Aligning
   point clouds along the coordinate system's main axes (also commonly
   known as pose normalization) is a task benefitting any point cloud
   processing workflow, be it manual or automated. With the goal of
   automating this task, we compare various existing methods and present
   our own approach based on point density histograms. We conclude this
   paper by comparing and discussing all methods in terms of speed and

Abstract = {Over the years, international researches about Facility Management has
   become increasingly important, also thanks to the advent of the BIM
   methodology which integrates information from all phases of the process,
   and closes, ideally in a circular way, the life cycle of a building.
   Within the abundant maintenance operations of the buildings
   characterizing the Facility Management phase, one of the important
   aspects is the H\&S planning and management for operators and
   maintenance technicians. This research uses a dynamic BIM-based approach
   for Health and Safety management during O\&M phase, connected to the
   programmed maintenance cycles, for a historical industrial plant.
   The case study presented is the former Fiat plant in Rivalta (TO),
   currently being converted into a warehouse and logistics facility by the
   FCA Group. Information comes from the project documents, from the
   Building Maintenance Plan and from the H\&S Maintenance dossier of the
   building installations should linked together. All of them are going to
   constitute the information component (LOI) relating to the BIM object.
   During the construction of the BIM model, the position of each object is
   valuable information, fundamental for the right choice of equipment and
   fittings necessary for the correct execution in safe, of maintenance
   operations. The safety of workplaces is related, for example, to access
   procedures to intervention area or to the correct selection of fall
   protection systems.
   First, an analysis on information necessary for the management of a safe
   O\&M in a BIM environment is carry out. BIM should not be only a
   digitizing way for work's file, it's not only a sheet containing
   processes and procedures identified by the safety coordinator; BIM, in
   this area, can be used as intelligent tool for risk assessment and,
   consequently, a methodology that can be used for choosing the most
   appropriate systems, in order to safeguard the workers H\&S.},

Abstract = {The Traditional Malay Houses (TMH) in Malaysia are considered as
   vernacular architecture, built and designed by the locals with
   thoughtful considerations and appreciation for nature. There are various
   beneficial features in technical and environmental contexts of a TMH
   that should be investigated further and applied in the present-day built
   environment. Due to its modularity and ingenious construction method, it
   is possible for a TMH to be dismantled, relocated and reconstructed in a
   new environment, also known as adaptive reuse practice. In Malaysia, a
   new trend has already emerged among built heritage lovers, business
   owners, individuals and universities to take the challenge of adaptive
   reusing abandoned traditional Malay houses for heritage conservation and
   tourism purposes.
   This paper aims to explore Building Information Modeling (BIM) usage to
   analyze the building and environment performance of a typical TMH in an
   adaptive reuse experiment. The analysis is important in order to
   maximize the building performance of the TMH once it has been
   constructed at the new location. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   the process of creating and organizing building data during its life
   cycle. Characteristically it uses three-dimensional building modeling
   software with smart parametric object features to increase efficiency in
   building design and construction. With the development of simulation
   technology in BIM, it is possible to evaluate the environmental
   performance of a building before the real construction begins. An
   on-going research project to dismantle, relocate and reconstruct a TMH
   has been used as a case study to explore the aim of this study. The
   Malaysia's Green Building Index (GBI) and Leadership in Energy and
   Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines were used to evaluate the design
   and performance of the TMH. A framework was acquired from literatures to
   establish the correlation between BIM for sustainable design analysis
   and the GBI and LEED assessment. The focus of this study is the building
   orientation and daylight performance. The framework was then justified
   by the case study. Through the usage of BIM software, in this case
   Autodesk Revit Architecture, the selected TMH was parametrically
   remodeled in order to coordinate any changes and maintain the
   consistency of the building components. The BIM model was then simulated
   for its building performance through secondary software, Autodesk Green
   Building Studio and the results were analyzed.
   The study eventually recommended improvements on the performance of the
   TMH through modification of some of the architectural components without
   losing the originality and heritage values of the building. Besides
   that, this study may also be served as a platform to promote the
   practice of adaptive reuse for heritage and conservation purposes
   through effective planning using BIM and its simulation tools.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm of
   procedures intended for use in building maintenance management (BMM),
   called SIAPME. Design/methodology/approach With basis on a literature
   review, an exploratory practical exercise was carried out, drawing up
   the SIAPME model and comprising several organisational charts with
   interconnections. Findings This study offers an overview of an
   alternative set of well-founded and integrated strategies for asset
   management. Overall, the basic characteristics of the outlined model
   seem to be in agreement with various existing models. Research
   limitations/implications - SIAPME's ambitious goal is to serve as a
   well-founded strategic basis for the development of an advanced software
   solution. However, it still lacks empirical validation, which could be a
   lengthy process. Practical implications - This research can provide a
   valuable input for a more in-depth discussion on the identification and
   correction of gaps for many systems currently in use. For instance, it
   is believed that an eventual SIAPME software solution may have potential
   for full compatibility with building information models, particularly
   focusing on the life cycle phase of utilisation, operation and building
   maintenance. Originality/value Through SIAPME procedures, a building
   manager will be allowed to have a very broad perspective of its
   functions, covering nearly all the fundamental aspects for efficient and
   integrated maintenance, with optimal control of all players in the
   process. As a concept idea and by introducing emerging and technological
   issues, the model can be advantageous for BMM.},

   public and private sectors supported by personal interviews with
   respondents either individually or in groups. Three hundred copies of
   the forms were distributed to the companies, firms and engineering
   departments of the various ministries of the state. After the data was
   obtained, two software (SPSS and SmartPLS) was used for analyzing the
   data and constructing the measurement model. The results showed of all
   the benefits constructed within three key components. The first is
   knowledge support for management in term of (costs, data, processes),
   the second is effective design performance and the third is effective
   construction performance and all these components were modeled as a
   measurement model.},

Abstract = {A building drainage system is an essential facility for building
   construction. The faulty performance of drainage equipment invalidates
   the entire system and threatens people's health. A comprehensive tool
   for diagnosing the drainage systems of existing buildings, based on an
   empirical approach and levelling methodology was validated by studying
   53 building drainage systems. Drainage system faults or problems were
   explicitly detected for facilitating decision-making regarding
   retrofitting. This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy and
   diagnostic tool that involves using a personal computer and mobile
   device application to diagnose faults in existing buildings. The
   proposed diagnostic tool can enable applying building information
   modelling in managing the performance and infection risk of building
   drainage systems.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling is a methodology, which is able to take
   into account many data, both geometrical and non-geometrical, in order
   to evaluate at the actual condition of the asset. The project has the
   scope of evaluating the conditions of different school buildings, in
   order to develop a way to choose the best-tailored management solution
   to the owner. A further step is the management and planning of design
   solutions during the life cycle customized on monitored buildings'
   conditions. The research work focuses on providing a support decisions
   concerning the gap between the present building state laws and the
   current state of the existing buildings. The process will be developed
   in an expanded BIM environment, using sensors, which will give back the
   state of the consistency of the actual conditions to enable the
   buildings to adapt themselves in the best way into their specific
   constraints and boundaries. The results of the study are (i) a complete
   workflow to make decision and the possibility to shape the decision
   process on an objective through a scientific approach, (ii) evaluate the
   current state of the asset and (iii) manage maintenance in the lifespan.
   Further development will take in consideration all the aspects related
   to management of big data environment generated by a smart buildings

Abstract = {The excessive use of fossil fuels has led to global warming and air
   pollution. To solve these problems, interest in new renewable energy
   system (NRE system) has increased in recent years. In particular,
   photovoltaic, solar thermal heating, fuel cell and ground source heating
   system are actively implemented for achieving the zero energy building.
   Since the initial investment cost of the NRE system is quite expensive,
   it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study from the life cycle
   perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to develop the process for the
   implementation of NRE system in a building for the optimal design. This
   study was conducted with four steps: (i) establishing the basic
   information for the system installation; (ii) selecting key factors
   affecting system performances; (iii) making possible alternatives of the
   system installation; and (iv) selecting optimal system by considering
   environmental and economic effect. The proposed process could enable the
   final decision-maker to easily and accurately determine the optimal
   design of the NRE systems from the economic and environmental efficiency
   in the early design phase. The process could also be applied to any
   other NRE system and could be extended to any other country in the
   global environment.},

Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) have witnessed a paramount increase in applications
   in multidisciplinary engineering systems. With advancements in
   structural health monitoring (SHM) methods and implementations, DT-based
   maintenance and operation stages have been implemented significantly
   during the life cycle of civil infrastructure. Recent literature has
   started laying the building blocks for incorporating the concept of DTs
   with SHM of large-scale civil infrastructure. This paper undertakes a
   systematic literature review of studies on DT-related applications for
   SHM of civil structures. It classifies the articles based on thematic
   case studies: transportation infrastructure (i.e. bridges, tunnels,
   roads, and pavements), buildings, off-shore marine infrastructure and
   wind turbines, and other civil engineering systems. The proposed review
   is further uniquely sub-classified using diverse modeling approaches
   such as building information modeling, finite element modeling, 3D
   representation, and surrogate and hybrid modeling used in DT
   implementations. This paper is solely focused on applications relating
   DTs to SHM practices for various civil engineering infrastructures,
   hence highlighting its novelty over previous reviews. Gaps and
   limitations emerging from the systematic review are presented, followed
   by articulating future research directions and key conclusions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel vision of paperless and visual lifecycle
   building management tools based on the coupling between Building
   Information Models (BIM) and Augmented Reality (AR) called Lifecycle
   Building Card. As the use of BIM increases within the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industries, new opportunities emerge to
   help stakeholders and maintenance operators to leverage the BIM dataset
   for lifecycle issues using realtime environments and simulation. In
   particular, a tighter coupling of BIM with computer vision techniques
   could enable innovative lifecycle management tools based on AR concepts.
   In this context, this work explores the possibilities and derives
   theoretical and practical concepts for the use of BIM enhanced by AR for
   supporting maintenance activities in buildings. An implementation of a
   wireless spatially aware display is presented as a first step toward the
   stated vision.},

Title = {Quantitative approach for evaluating the building design features impact
   on cooling energy consumption in hot climates},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {211},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Architectural building design practic in hot climate regions has
   high-priority in the design process. Thus, selecting appropriate
   Architectural Design Features (ADFs) at the early design stage provides
   significant opportunities to control heat flows, maximize building
   energy performance, reduce excessive energy consumption cost, and
   preserve a comfortable temperature for occupants. In this research, an
   ArchitecturalBased Energy Impact Scoring System (AEISS) was developed
   based on inputs from 10 expert architects, and it consists of seven ADFs
   and 40 multiple design options. The proposed system provides a simple
   decision scoring system for designers to evaluate design alternatives
   and optimize the energy consumption of buildings in the early design
   phase. A simple user-friendly program for the AEISS was developed to
   assist the designers in generating the design alternatives scores.
   Energy simulation analyses were performed to validate the applicability
   of the proposed AEISS by integrating 3-D BIM models of three different
   design alternatives of a residential building in Saudi Arabia with
   Ecotect analysis software. A detailed analysis was performed to evaluate
   the energy impact of the selected ADFs and to compare the alternatives
   in terms of energy consumptions and cost-efficiency. The simulation
   results proved that the proposed AEISS gave responsive results and is
   capable of providing stakeholders with the optimum decision to select
   the design alternative with high energy performance and low consumption
   cost. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Design optimization of noise barrier tunnels through component reuse:
   Minimization of costs and CO2 emissions using multi-objective genetic
   algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {298},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Reuse is known to be an effective method to increase the sustainability
   of the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, which
   account for a majority of CO2 emissions and waste generation. However,
   despite the environmental benefits involved, additional costs and
   increased design difficulty limit the application of reuse. This paper
   proposes an optimal design method that minimizes the CO2 emissions and
   costs of the noise barrier tunnel. In the proposed method, information
   on reusable steel beams from the building information modeling data of
   the noise barrier tunnel is extracted, and the optimization problem is
   defined. In addition, designs and component procurement plans aiming to
   minimize CO2 emissions and costs are derived using a multi-objective
   genetic algorithm. The results of the case study show that depending on
   the situation, CO2 emissions are reduced from 1\% to 92\% and costs are
   reduced by up to 25\% relative to the case without reuse. As in previous
   studies, CO2 emission could be reduced herein through reuse, but an
   increase in costs was observed in some cases. This study contributes to
   the literature by providing optimal alternatives for designers through
   an optimal design method integrating strategies to overcome barriers to
   the practice of reuse. The case study results also highlight the need
   for an assessment through the entire life cycle, including the
   modification and in-spection processes of reusable components that are
   generally excluded. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Industry 4.0 opens to the sector of building constructions a new
   perspective, especially in relation to the digitalization of information
   and to the use of Big Data Analytics to manage them. Gathering data on
   new and existing buildings to provide a more and more complete view on
   the outcomes of the choices of construction, in order to ideally
   optimize the designing process, has already been identified as one of
   the main purposes. Yet, despite the available data are much less, the
   same vision can also make it possible, by enhancing and emphasizing
   monitoring activity in this field, to build another kind of database,
   involving an aspect that is equally crucial for a building and its
   components: the building management phase, that is to say the planning
   of maintenance activities, the cost of which cannot be overlooked.
   Looking ahead to the possibility of developing such database, multiple
   ways of making use of it to guide designers in the choices related to
   life cycle planning, unfold. Considering a necessary step that of
   realizing tools to evaluate such choices according to at least one
   parameter, in order to guide designers towards choices that are
   consistent with their purposes, this work investigates the possibilities
   in this field, and proposes a software tool to elaborate strategies and
   compare them on the basis of the cost parameter. Finally, hypothesis of
   inclusion of this kind of software in a BIM platform are suggested, in a
   view of facility management of BIM 7D.},

Title = {Potential of Computed Aided Facility Management for Urban Water
   Infrastructure with the Focus on Rainwater Management},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the information modeling of buildings and its
   subsequent extension to the information modeling of cities, which can be
   considered as the main topics of the construction industry development.
   It offers new knowledge for city management, facility management and
   other fields of construction sector. Information modeling of buildings
   and cities creates a suitable basis for the creation of various
   simulations (acoustic, thermal, environmental influence, sunlight or the
   spread of pollution) and analyses. Simulations and results obtained from
   them can help us in the decision-making phase, they predict problems or
   unexpected situations during the life cycle of cities and buildings, and
   thus make it possible to prevent their occurrence. In the second part of
   the contribution, an innovative model, the so-called R-WIM, is
   presented. BIM modeling methods were used for the research and extended
   to the public environment. The expansion of the public environment
   digitization enables to obtain a sufficient amount of information about
   the public space and then subsequently combine them with static weather
   data. This model deals with Urban Water Infrastructure with the focus on
   Rainwater Management and has been developed for the particular needs of
   individual municipalities in the process of solving problem situations
   associated with rainwater, which is very current due to climate change,
   and municipalities require appropriate tools to predict the behavior of
   rainwater so that various compensatory measures can be created.},

Title = {An LCA-BIM integrated model for carbon-emission calculation of
   prefabricated buildings},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {203},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Carbon emissions from the building sector account for around half of
   China's national CEs and have been the obstacle to reaching China's
   two-carbon goal. However, whether the prefabricated technique can
   mitigate CEs for the building sector is still argued by studies. In
   consideration of this, this study proposes an LCA and BIMsimulation
   integrated model to comprehensively calculate CEs of prefabricated (PBs)
   and traditional cast-insitu buildings (TBs). The BIM simulation is
   verified by an analytical method. The results show that the total carbon
   emission intensity (CEI) of PB is 9.61 \% lower than that of the TB,
   showing a significant advantage in CE reduction potential and can be
   chosen as the developing direction in the future. The main CEs come from
   the operation and maintenance stage, where the TB emits 11.02 \% higher
   CEs than those of the PB. For the materialization stage, where CEs are
   centralized in a short period, the difference between CEIs of the PB and
   TB is 3.32 \%, which is not significantly different. The collected data
   and calculated results in this study can be quite beneficial to future
   sustainability studies in the same research domain, especially the
   integrated application of BIM and LCA. This study also contributes to
   knowledge by proposing a comprehensive CE calculation model and
   providing reasonable measures for CE reduction, which is beneficial to
   the sustainable development of the building sector to achieve China's
   two-carbon goal.},

Title = {Hierarchical SVM for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds for
   Infrastructure Scenes},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The incorporation of building information modeling (BIM) has brought
   about significant advancements in civil engineering, enhancing
   efficiency and sustainability across project life cycles. The
   utilization of advanced 3D point cloud technologies such as laser
   scanning extends the application of BIM, particularly in operations and
   maintenance, prompting the exploration of automated solutions for
   labor-intensive point cloud modeling. This paper presents a
   demonstration of supervised machine learning-specifically, a support
   vector machine-for the analysis and segmentation of 3D point clouds,
   which is a pivotal step in 3D modeling. The point cloud semantic
   segmentation workflow is extensively reviewed to encompass critical
   elements such as neighborhood selection, feature extraction, and feature
   selection, leading to the development of an optimized methodology for
   this process. Diverse strategies are implemented at each phase to
   enhance the overall workflow and ensure resilient results. The
   methodology is then evaluated using diverse datasets from infrastructure
   scenes of bridges and compared with state-of-the-art deep learning
   models. The findings highlight the effectiveness of supervised machine
   learning techniques at accurately segmenting 3D point clouds,
   outperforming deep learning models such as PointNet and PointNet++ with
   smaller training datasets. Through the implementation of advanced
   segmentation techniques, there is a partial reduction in the time
   required for 3D modeling of point clouds, thereby further enhancing the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the BIM process.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become a widely accepted method for
   environmental assessment of buildings, but is still not commonly applied
   in design practice. The biggest potential for optimization and reduction
   of GHG emissions lies in the early stages of the design process.
   Therefore, a design-integrated approach for LCA is needed. The goal of
   this paper is to describe the development of a parametric LCA tool for
   application in early design stages in the Swiss context. The envisioned
   users of the tool are primarily architecture and engineering students,
   but also practitioners. The integration of LCA throughout the design
   process is solved through a modular strategy. In the early stage,
   pre-defined components are selected to model a complete LCA. In the
   following design steps when more information is available, individual
   materials can be input with higher level of detail. The Bombyx tool is
   developed as a plugin for Grasshopper based on Rhinoceros3D and includes
   an SQL material and component database. Users are able to choose
   different materials and building systems and quickly modify the
   building's geometry while continuously receiving the calculated
   environmental impact in real-time. Visualization of the results, e.g.
   colour code indicate how the design performs in relation to a benchmark
   or optimization potential. The project is developed in open source to
   broaden the user and developer community and foster new ideas, designs
   and implementations in Bombyx.},

Title = {A budget for the ecological footprint of buildings is possible: A case
   study using the dwelling construction cost database of Andalusia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, the ARDITEC research group has developed a
   methodology for the calculation of the ecological footprint of buildings
   throughout their life cycle. The model starts with the evaluation of the
   information in the budget on whether they are urbanization,
   construction, renovation, or demolition projects, and evaluates its
   impact employing databases of Life Cycle Analysis. In the present work,
   the methodology is adapted in order to be valid in the determination of
   project budgets that simultaneously calculate the economic cost and its
   ecological footprint. The boundaries of the problem are the ones already
   defined in the Andalusian construction cost databases. The database has
   a pyramidal structure (basic elements or units) enables either the
   impact of work units to be combined or the cost or impact to be
   determined of different stages (earthworks, foundations, structures,
   etc.). The present work evaluates, for the first time, all the basic
   elements in dwelling construction, approximately 7000 items. Finally, a
   case study of the urbanization and construction of dwellings in
   Andalusia is presented. The economic control of the budgets provides the
   opportunity to introduce the control of the environmental impact by

Title = {MODELLING THE KEY ENABLERS OF ORGANIZATIONAL BUILDING INFORMATION
   MODELLING (BIM) IMPLEMENTATION: AN INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELLING
   (ISM) APPROACH},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation is a dynamic process
   and there are a number of influential variables that may change
   throughout. There is little research on the dynamics of the change
   environment and the AEC organizations' approaches to BIM adoption and
   implementation. A considerable number of BIM enablers have been
   identified and/or developed in the extant literature. However,
   stipulating BIM implementation enablers per se provides only a static
   view that is not adequate for describing effective management of BIM
   implementation in Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
   organizations. This study is the second part of an ongoing research
   about BIM implementation enablers. In the first paper ``Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) adoption and implementation enablers in AEC
   firms: a systematic literature review{''} (Abbasnejad et al., 2020) the
   organizational BIM enablers have been identified. The aim of this second
   paper is to (1) further review and validate the key BIM implementation
   enablers using both the existing literature and expert interviews, and
   (2) develop a structural model of the key enablers using the ISM
   technique to understand the mutual interaction of these enablers and
   identify the driving enablers and the dependent enablers. Twentyeight
   enablers for BIM implementation were initially identified from the
   literature and subsequent discussion with experts from academia and
   industry has been conducted to select most key BIM implementation
   enablers. Eleven enablers were finally chosen based on the literature
   review and expert interviews and the Interpretive Structural Modeling
   (ISM) technique has been adopted to evaluate the contextual
   interrelationships among them. MICMAC (Matrix Impacts Cross-reference
   Multiplication Applied to a Classification) analysis was employed to
   classify the eleven enablers based on their dependence and driving
   power. The results indicate that there is no enabler in the autonomous
   cluster and this therefore signifies that all enablers are required for
   the implementation of BIM. BIM leadership and top management support
   have been identified as the enablers with the highest driving power in
   the initial stages of the BIM adoption and implementation process and
   for that reason, these enablers demand a that there are other enablers
   that will be impacted.},

Title = {Assessing Environmental Impact Indicators in Road Construction Projects

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Environmental pollution is considered to be one of the main concerns in
   the construction industry. Environmental pollution has become a major
   challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution
   caused by construction projects. There are different types of
   environmental impact indicators, such as the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP),
   human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these
   environmental impact indicators can be linked to different phases of the
   construction projects. The overall environmental impact indicators can
   be divided into direct, indirect, and operational emissions. This paper
   presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based methodology for the
   assessment of environmental impacts in road construction projects. The
   model takes into account the overall life cycle of the road construction
   project, which is divided into: manufacturing phase, transportation
   phase, construction phase, maintenance phase, operational phase,
   recycling phase, and deconstruction phase. A case study is presented to
   demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. The proposed model
   solves a major problem for road construction project teams who want to
   assess the environmental impact indicators associated with their project
   prior to the start of the execution of their projects.},

Title = {Integration of BIM and Energy Consumption Modelling for Manufacturing
   Prefabricated Components: A Case Study in China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Prefabrication is undergoing significant growth in the building and
   construction sector in China. Meanwhile, the integrated measurement and
   reduction solution for energy consumption is quickly becoming an
   important target of scientific efforts and research, especially in
   prefabricated buildings. Embedded energy consumption requirements can
   potentially be reduced during the manufacturing process of prefabricated
   components: the opportunity for its reduction can be significant. This
   paper aims to propose a BIM and LCA integrated approach that enables the
   energy consumption of prefabricated components in the manufacturing
   stage to be extracted and calculated in order to obtain a clear, precise
   understanding of the energy consumption management in prefabrication. To
   enhance the energy consumption description of prefabricated components,
   this paper clarifies the contents of energy consumption inventory and
   related calculation formula in raw material extraction and production,
   material transportation, and factorized production of prefabricated
   components, respectively. Specifically, considering that current
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard does not accommodate entities
   with energy consumption information or relationships, it applies the IFC
   extension method to connect the energy consumption inventory with the
   BIM model. The proposed approach is applied and verified in a case study
   from China. This study reveals that energy consumption control should be
   investigated in the element level considering the differences of various
   prefabricated components' requirements in the manufacturing stage.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Improving the energy performance of existing buildings is one of the
   main strategies defined by the European Union to reduce global energy
   costs. Amongst the actions to be carried out in buildings to achieve
   this objective is working with passive measures adapted to each type of
   climate. To assist designers in the process of finding appropriate
   solutions for each building and location, different tools have been
   developed and since the implementation of building information modeling
   (BIM), it has been possible to perform an analysis of a building's life
   cycle from an energy perspective and other types of analysis such as a
   comfort analysis. In the case of Spain, the first BIM environment tool
   has been implemented that deals with the global analysis of a building's
   behavior and serves as an alternative to previous methods characterized
   by their lack of both flexibility and information offered to designers.
   This paper evaluates and compares the official Spanish energy
   performance evaluation tool (Cypetherm) released in 2018 using a case
   study involving the installation of sunlight control devices as part of
   a building refurbishment. It is intended to determine how databases and
   simplifications affect the designer's decision-making. Additionally, the
   yielded energy results are complemented by a comfort analysis to explore
   the impact of these improvements from a users' wellbeing viewpoint. At
   the end of the process the yielded results still confirm that the
   simulation remains far from reality and that simulation tools can indeed
   influence the decision-making process.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Interest in intrinsically low-energy construction materials is becoming
   mainstream, and bio-based materials form a key part of that group of
   materials. The goal of this study was to analyse the environmental
   impact of applying a sol-gel coating on hemp shiv, in order to improve
   the durability of this innovative bio-based material, using a
   regionalised LCA model, taking into account regional specific
   peculiarities. This study analysed the environmental performance of
   using bio-based materials in the building envelope compared with
   traditional synthetic construction materials, and compared the impact of
   a regionalised approach with a global approach. The carbon footprint of
   treated hemp shiv in a wall with a U-value of 0.15 W/m(2).K was compared
   to untreated hempcrete and a reference cavity wall with the same
   U-value. Considering the environmental damage caused by the production
   of hemp shiv, nitrogen fertiliser was the hotspot. The LCA results
   showed that, using innovative bio-based materials in construction,
   treated hemp shiv with sol-gel can decrease the carbon footprint of a
   building envelope through carbon sequestration. Using the more accurate
   site-specific information in life cycle inventory and impact assessment
   methods will result in more consistent and site-appropriate
   environmental results for decision-making.},

Abstract = {The management of data, information and knowledge through the project
   life cycle of buildings and civil infrastructure projects is becoming
   increasingly complex. As an attempt to drive efficiencies and address
   this complexity, the United Kingdom Government has mandated that
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) methods must be adopted in all
   public sector construction projects in 2016. Emerging from the US
   Department of Defence, BIM is an approach to the co-ordination of design
   and production data using object-oriented principles as described in ISO
   29481-1:2010. The underlying philosophy of BIM is to ensure the
   ``provision of a single environment to store shared asset data and
   information, accessible to all individuals who are required to produce,
   use and maintain it{''} (PAS 1192-2:2013). A key aspect of BIM lies in
   the notion of `interoperability' between various software applications
   used in the design and construction process and a common data format for
   the efficient exchange of design information and knowledge. Protagonists
   of BIM argue that this interoperability provides an effective
   environment for collaboration between actors in the construction process
   and creates accurate, reliable, repeatable and high-quality information
   exchange. This UK government mandate presents numerous challenges to the
   architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professions; in
   particular, the characteristics of BIM Level 2 remain explicitly
   undefined and this created a degree of uncertainty amongst the promoters
   and those professionals charged with delivering projects. This research
   casts a critical lens on the current literature in the domains of
   object-oriented modelling of infrastructure and the associated
   implications for procurement and project management. A mixed-methods
   approach using questionnaire analysis and secondary case study analysis
   was used to enact an inductive research approach that captures a range
   of data on the practical issues and considerations associated with the
   integration of BIM in the industry.},

Title = {Methods for the Automated Assignment and Comparison of Building Damage
   Geometries},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Condition assessment of structures supports effective repair,
   restoration or reconstruction works on buildings of infrastructural or
   cultural importance and is therefore an important contribution to
   building and infrastructure sustainability. Due to increasing ageing and
   external influences continuous monitoring is obligatory to maintain the
   structures. Throughout the entire life cycle, digital scans of changing
   damages and the building geometry, up to the degree of a digital twin,
   can be acquired using modern inspection methods. This allows for the
   automation of condition assessment processes to locate, quantify and
   predict damage progression at a structure related to building
   information models. However, the usual inspection documentation as
   performed in the past neither includes an assignment of damages to
   digital building models nor relates the history of recordings to a
   damage entity, which consequently makes a direct condition state
   comparison unfeasible.
   The paper presents voxel based methods for the automated assignment of
   geometrical representations of damages to elements of a corresponding
   building model as well as to past damage scans, which describe the same
   damage entity. Furthermore, the comparison and computation of discrete
   geometric changes based on the assignments is shown. Additionally, the
   clustering of scanned damage geometries into interest areas for the
   usage in planning processes for further inspections is presented. The
   resulting set of methods enables an automated condition comparison of
   damages on each surveyed state of the structure and supports the
   integration of inspection data to building information models.},

Abstract = {Purpose The utilisation of building information modelling (BIM)
   technology is rapidly increasing among construction professionals across
   the world. Notwithstanding, recent studies revealed a low level of BIM
   implementation in the context of the Nigerian construction sector.
   Moreover, previous studies have established that BIM application comes
   with its share of various barriers. Therefore, this study aims to carry
   out an on-site survey on barriers to the application of BIM on
   construction sites in the Nigerian construction industry.
   Design/methodology/approach An extensive review of literature on BIM
   barriers was conducted, from where 33 factors were identified as
   significant BIM barriers peculiar to the developing countries. A
   questionnaire was developed and distributed to the targeted respondents,
   who are practicing professionals in the Nigerian construction industry,
   based on the identified barriers. The data collected were analysed by
   using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings The
   principal component analysis revealed that 27 barriers were peculiar to
   the Nigerian construction industry. The ``lack of familiarity with BIM
   capacity, habitual resistance to change from the traditional style of
   design and build, and poor awareness of BIM benefit{''} were identified
   as the three most critical barriers hindering BIM application on
   construction sites in the Nigerian construction industry. Practical
   implications This study reveals key information on the peculiar barriers
   to BIM application in the Nigerian construction industry. The avoidance
   of these barriers will not only assist various construction stakeholders
   in the successful implementation of BIM application on a construction
   project but also promote information management systems and productivity
   within the construction industry to a great extent. These will further
   improve post-construction activities. Originality/value This study
   provides a substantial understanding of BIM state of the art in the
   context of barriers hindering BIM application on construction sites in
   the Nigerian construction industry.},

Abstract = {This article mainly discussed the present application and development
   trend of the Building Information Model (BIM) in the field of
   architectural heritage management in China. BIM could create consistent
   relationship between geometric information and non-geometric properties
   in a building model, and had prominent technological characteristics
   such as design parameterization, data visualization, statistics
   automatization and work cooperation. So it not only could solve the
   problems of ``Information Silo{''} among the traditional databases and
   of ``Information Cutout{''} in the information managements, but also
   could provide a new development orientation for the Building Lifecycle
   Information Management (BLM) of architectural heritages in China. Now,
   as a new management technology, BIM should be developed in three aspects
   for BLM of architectural heritages: the customized development on
   specialization functions in the BIM software, information interchange
   among the different software, the interoperability managements on GIS
   and BIM.},

   barriers to DfD practices. The results of phenomenology reveal 26
   barriers under five key barrier categories. The barrier categories to
   DfD are `lack of stringent legislation and policies', `lack of adequate
   information at the design stage', `lack of large enough market for
   recovered components', `difficulty in developing a business case for
   DfD', and `lack of effective DfD tools'. After this, the study
   identifies the strategies for overcoming these barriers. The paper,
   therefore, addresses the need for actions within the construction

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {133},
Pages = {228-236},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered as the most suitable way to
   assess the environmental impact of buildings. Due to its extensiveness
   and complexity, but also due to a lack of knowledge amongst architects,
   the LCA methodology is currently most often applied as a post-design
   evaluation and not used to support or optimize design decisions during
   early design stages. Therefore, this paper looks at possible solutions
   to apply LCA, including operational energy demand simulation, in early
   design from two different perspectives: design-oriented user
   requirements, derived from literature, a survey, interviews and a focus
   group with architects, and LCA simplification strategies based on a
   literature review. Both perspectives are discussed and merged into an
   evaluation framework that can be used to check the suitability of
   LCA-based environmental impact assessment (EIA) tools for use by
   architects during early design stages, but also to develop new
   design-supportive LCA-based EIA tools. In turn, this can contribute to
   an increased uptake of these tools in building practice.},

Title = {Implementation of Building Information Modeling Technologies in Wood
   Construction: A Review of the State of the Art from a Multidisciplinary
   Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {This research raises questions about the possibilities and options of
   using the BIM methodology associated with software for the wood design
   and construction of structure modeling along an asset's cycle life.
   Likewise, several academic and research initiatives are reviewed. In
   this sense, this paper aims to establish an appropriate link between two
   agendas that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   industry, academia, and governments normally handle separately. By
   conducting several literature reviews (book, journals, and congresses)
   and extensive software tests (BIM software: Revit v2023, Archicad v27,
   Tekla, and wood plug-ins: AGACAD, Archiframe, Timber Framing 2015,
   WoodStud Frame, etc.), the state-of-the-art was assessed in both fields,
   and several cases linking BIM and wood are shown in detail and
   discussed. Various theoretical samples are modelled and shown, and the
   advantages and disadvantages of each technique and stage are explained.
   On the other hand, although wood construction has been most common for
   hundreds of years, this is not the case of BIM software developments
   associated with this materiality. Furthermore, since the appearance of
   materials such as steel and reinforced concrete, all software
   developments have focused on these materials, leaving aside the
   possibility of developing applications for use in wood projects.
   According to that previously discussed, it can be concluded that BIM for
   wood has been used more frequently in academia, that both fields have
   several common processes, and, in many cases, that only a few BIM-wood
   tools have been used, thus disregarding the high potential and high
   level of benefits that result with the application of these
   methodologies for the complete building life cycle (design,
   construction, and operation).},

Abstract = {Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) has become the ideal tool
   for professionals studying building conservation and restoration. The
   BIM model allows one to identify structural deformations following
   three-dimensionally resolved models. In addition, this methodology is
   specifically designed to register parametric construction models, as an
   information manager by adding semantic components to the model,
   including information on the different transformations of the historical
   artefact, and allowing continuous progress in the building's life cycle.
   In this work, graphic information and data related to conservation
   projects are compiled that allow a management of all the documentation
   integrated in the same Project, from all the disciplinary fields related
   to the heritage conservation and rehabilitation process. Specifically,
   from the geometric identification and the restoration documents, it is
   intended to develop an experimental application where both terrestrial
   laser scanning records and the use of image processing routines can
   allow automatic operations to monitor alterations in facades, in order
   to subsequent control by conservation experts. For this, a building with
   certain characteristics has been chosen, such as the Miguel de Manara
   palace in the city of Seville. A building that has a main facade of
   43.30 metres in length by 6.75 metres in height and, in which its facade
   rotates in an angled guideline to adapt to the urban planning of the
   time. The analysis is based on the applicability of two segmentation
   algorithms and the construction of the multilayer enclosure model where
   the different stratigraphies of the results obtained are exposed.},

Abstract = {The development of a flexible and comprehensive data structure for
   product models for serving all possible downstream applications in CIC
   environments have been the subject of research for many years. Although,
   international initiatives have been established such as STEP and
   IAI/IFCs, these standards have been setup to mainly act as a common
   platform for project data exchange only. Thus, the integration of
   project information between construction applications has not been fully
   addressed. This paper discusses the SPACE approach to integrating
   project data cross its life cycle. It firstly explains the building data
   model which supports the building design information and secondly it
   outlines the interaction between the building data model and the other
   application models in the form of EXPRESS-G diagrams. This integration
   approach currently supports five application; specification,
   construction planning, site layout planning, interim valuation and
   virtual reality.},

Abstract = {Today, built facilities consume nearly 40\% of the global energy and
   produce about 30\% of CO2 emissions and solid waste. To decrease these
   rates, the evaluation, simulation and optimisation of energy efficiency
   of products for built facilities and facility components should be
   performed in various real-life scenarios before their actual use in
   practice. This paper presents a suggested Virtual Energy Laboratory
   where the involved multiple players can monitor the energy efficiency of
   a facility in all phases of the building life cycle by examining
   simultaneously various climatic, usage and design variations. To enable
   such simulation studies the Virtual Laboratory will provide for a huge
   number of parallel computations with varying simulation parameters from
   product data catalogues, climate data, user profiles and BIM model data
   using cloud technology. Moreover, it will also allow examining energy
   relevant product components like HVAC equipment or facade elements in
   different virtual building scenarios by simultaneously running
   simulations of the same component on different BIM data or climatic
   conditions. The paper describes the first steps of the Virtual
   Laboratory realisation including the developed principal software
   architecture and a first rapid prototype implementation. The presented
   work is done in the frames of the EU projects HESMOS (2010-13) and ISES
   (2011-2014).},

Abstract = {In recent years, machine vision systems have been introduced into the
   electronics manufacturing industry for control and inspection
   applications. For some applications, great benefit has been derived, but
   serious limitations affecting flexibility and the system life cycle have
   been exposed. This paper proposes a model for building integratable
   vision machines capable of deriving benefit from support information,
   providing facilities to ease change and improve flexibility. A proof of
   concept implementation is discussed using information storage based on
   both the relational and the object-oriented models. The paper
   presupposes the need for an integration infrastructure such as that
   specified by CIM-OSA or as implemented at Loughborough University of
   Technology by the Systems Integration Group as the CIM-BIOSYS (Computer
   Integrated Manufacturing Building Integrated Open Systems) integration

Abstract = {It is long recognized by the industry practitioners that how well
   preproject planning is conducted has great impact on project outcome.
   Through industry project data collection and model analysis, this
   research intends to investigate the relationship between preproject
   planning and project success. In early stage of the project life cycle,
   essential project information is collected and crucial decisions are
   made. It is also tit this stage where risks associated with the project
   are analyzed and the specific project execution approach is defined. To
   assist with the early planning process, Construction Industry Institute
   (CII) has developed a scope definition tool, Project Definition Rating
   Index (PDRI) for industrial and building industry. Since its
   introduction, PDRI has been widely used by the industry and researchers
   have been using the PDRI to collect preproject planning information from
   the industry. Scope definition information as well as project
   performance are collected and used for this research analysis. This
   research summarizes preproject planning data collected from 62
   industrial projects and 78 building projects, representing approximately
   \$5 billion in total construction cost. Based on the information
   obtained, preproject planning was identified as having direct impact on
   the project success (cost and schedule performance). Two techniques were
   then used to develop models for predicting cost and schedule growth:
   statistical analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). The research
   results provide a valuable source of information for the industry
   practitioners that proves better planning in the early stage of the
   project life cycle have positive impact on the final project outcome.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the approaches to analysis in order to optimize the
   construction facilities (buildings and complexes) information models
   management. Two criteria have been proposed and discussed for the model
   quality evaluation: model informational saturation criterion and model
   topicality criterion. Practical application of the first criterion
   enables to define the optimal plan of information model filling.
   Herewith, the optimization is carried out through the maximum volume of
   useful information. The criterion is used at all stages of the model
   life cycle during the course of the model data updating. The second
   criterion allows to evaluate the need in the model data update. Being a
   vector (in the space of the modelling object significant values) of
   deviation of the model data from the model object data, the criterion
   represents the need to initiate the model data updating procedure using
   the predefined rules},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has catalyzed transformative shifts
   across various industries, which has sparked broader research interests
   in the BIM lifecycle. However, studies that specify the stated
   requirements for different technologies and methodologies from the
   perspective of the BIM lifecycle and analyze research hotspots and
   future research trends at each stage are scarce. Employing scientometric
   theories and methods, this study conducts an in-depth comparative
   analysis of BIM lifecycle stages. The analysis encompasses several
   aspects like annual research output and knowledge flows, in the aim of
   unveiling disparities in the technological requirements, defining
   research boundaries, and illuminating lifecycle research trends.
   Findings indicate an ongoing surge in research across all BIM lifecycle
   stages with technologies like digital twins and artificial intelligence
   becoming prevailing trends. The cooperative design of BIM components,
   virtual-real world coordination, interactions among buildings,
   individuals, and environments, as well as the in-depth integration of
   BIM with the multifaceted fields of urban management have emerged as
   focal points in the planning, construction, management, and maintenance
   of BIM, respectively. Future BIM lifecycle research will necessitate
   interdisciplinary collaboration, emphasizing technological integration,
   common data environment (CDE) information sharing, open-source
   BIM/historic building information modeling (HBIM) system, and impactful
   exploration in areas like urban construction and historical
   preservation.},

Abstract = {Post-disaster reconstruction (PDR) is a dynamic, complex system that is
   chaotic in nature, and represents many challenges and issues. Recently,
   building information modelling (BIM) has been commonly utilized in the
   construction industry to solve complex and dynamic challenges. However,
   BIM has not been thoroughly considered for managing PDR, and there is a
   lack of comprehensive scientometric analyses that objectively examine
   the trends in BIM applications in PDR. A literature search was performed
   considering studies published from 2010 to March 2021 using the Scopus
   database. A total of 75 relevant studies were found to meet the
   inclusion criteria. The collected literature was analyzed using
   VOSviewer through scientific journals, authors, keywords, citations, and
   countries. This is the first study in its vital significance and
   originality that aims to investigate the current states of research on
   BIM applications in PDR and provide suggestions for potential research
   directions. The findings showed that ``Reconstruction{''} and ``Safety
   Management{''} have emerged as mainstream research themes in this field
   and recently attracted scholars' interest, which could represent the
   directions of future research. Five major research domains associated
   with BIM were identified based on the most frequently used keywords,
   namely ``Disasters{''}, ``Earthquakes{''}, ``HBIM{''}, ``Damage
   Detection{''}, and ``Life Cycle{''}. Moreover, a proposed conceptual
   framework of BIM adoption for PDR is provided. Accordingly, the outcomes
   of this study will help scholars and practitioners gain clear ideas of
   the present status and identify the directions of future research.},

Abstract = {Heterogeneous customer requirements in combination with technological
   improvements enable new or improved customer-driven business processes.
   The management of such processes requires a deep but flexible
   integration of enterprises. In this context new forms of cooperation
   like E-Collaboration, describing the efficient and effective
   collaboration of participants in a value-added network, arise. In order
   to manage customer-driven business processes across such networks,
   existing concepts for business process management need to be adapted and
   extended. In this paper an E-Collaboration architecture is presented,
   that shows how cross-enterprise, customer-driven processes can be
   planned, implemented and controlled. The architecture is based on the
   differentiation of global and local knowledge in the widely used
   Architecture for Integrated Information Systems (ARIS), developed at the
   IWi. Another important building block is the life-cycle-model that
   serves as a guideline for the process-oriented creation and operation of
   collaborations towards a common customer-driven production and bundling
   of goods and services.},

Abstract = {Worldwide the construction industry presents a significant demand for
   new technologies ensuring certainty, cost-effectiveness and time
   efficiency. Modern construction relies on digital resources, and one of
   the most prominent novelties is Building Information Modelling (BIM).
   Construction planning effectiveness is based on clear communication and
   integration between project planners and other participants, such as
   engineers, architects, suppliers, and workforce. The possible connection
   between 3 D models and time or scheduling potentially reduces
   misconception risks and lack of information to avoid re-scheduling and
   project delivery delays. This study aims to investigate the integration
   of Revit, Navisworks, Tally and Green Building Studio for identifying
   the challenges in applying 4 D BIM technology using a case study in a
   developing country (Brazil). The research method used comprised these
   steps: objectives definition, literature review, development of the 4 D
   analysis and evaluation, case study for validation with comparison to
   other comparable and contrasting studies, and discussion of the results.
   This paper demonstrates the feasibility and challenges to adopt BIM
   technology to thrive better communication for teams and stakeholders
   through the various construction stages via visual representation.
   Additionally, despite the obstacles and difficulties to integrate
   different software, it is beneficial to the decision-makers, not only
   focus on the constructability perspective but project's environmental
   impacts, such as energy efficiency and global warming effect.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is a natural-resource-consuming agent. As a
   result environmental criteria and other key factors must be integrated
   into construction processes throughout their life cycle. On the other
   hand, a more general concept of sustainability considers equally
   economic, social and functional factors. All these matters entail the
   management of much information and disciplines that require a specific
   methodology to quantify their real influence on constructive models. In
   recent years, there has been progress in favour of buildings being more
   environmentally friendly. However, sustainable construction has centred
   on residential and office buildings. It could be said that there is a
   lack of focus on sustainability in the construction of industrial
   buildings, which present specific characteristics that differentiate
   them from residential buildings. This paper aims to analyse the
   sustainable environmental requirements for an industrial building by
   defining a system of specific indicators to assess building behaviour
   against these requirements, ultimately generating an assessment model as
   a basis for measuring a building's `environmental sustainability index'.},

Abstract = {The promise of smart buildings (SBs) is a safer more productive
   environment for users and a more operationally efficient building for
   owners. The automation of building function is highly dependent on
   sensing devices and Smart Building Applications(SBAs), which are often
   only evaluated in situ post deployment, making re-development costly. In
   this paper we explore our experiences developing a Simulated Context
   (SimCon) Model which currently supports taking information from a
   Virtual Reality (VR) SB and converting it into three types of location
   context to conduct early rapid evaluation of location based SBAs. This
   model is expressed using the Sensor Modelling Language (sensorML). It
   also explores the integration of this model into the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) for modelling and simulating SBs. It also details
   usability evaluations of the SimConfig and SimConViz Tool for improving
   evaluation during the design phase of smart building development life
   cycle.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has grown as the major energy consumer in
   China's economy with the rapid development of urbanization, continually
   increasing the stress on the environment, healthcare, and economy.
   Therefore, this study developed an integrated framework for embodied
   energy quantification of China's buildings from a multi-regional
   perspective. This article builds on previous work on embodied energy
   quantification and develops an optimized algorithm that illustrated how
   the technological difference and the regional features are calculated as
   indices of embodied energy quantification at the project level, using
   multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis, structural path analysis
   (SPA), and process-based LCA model as the underlying methods. The
   structure of the proposed framework using calculative modules as well as
   the data sources are specified. The application of the analytical
   framework in real building cases demonstrates that it can provide
   valuable information of detailed embodied energy distribution through
   the whole supply chain. The implementation of the proposed framework can
   facilitate decision-makers to examine the effects of changes in
   geographical location, building type, and building structure on the
   total embodied energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Building product information is still mostly distributed, heterogeneous,
   unstructured, with inconsistent semantics and communicated using low
   technology means. Over the last decade, there has been little progress
   towards change. Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   practitioners still face challenges when searching and acquiring
   necessary information and re-using it in their ICT tools. Whilst
   manufacturer information is more focused on trade and business
   processes, the demand for precision technical data by designers and
   engineers is continually growing with more mature and complex standards
   and ICT tools used in energy performance analysis, Life-Cycle Cost
   (LCC), LifeCycle Assessment (LCA) and BIM processes. The majority of
   product manufacturers are small, regional companies, many with limited
   ICT capabilities and resources to keep up with this growing demand. In
   this paper we report on an enhanced approach to provide standard
   structured building product information with consistent semantics across
   multidisciplinary processes. The approach is based on Linked Data

Abstract = {When creating a product, a supplier faces the problem of designing the
   optimal contract to screen the manufacturer's private information. In
   this paper, we consider a manufacturer with private information about
   the cost type of production (N types defined in this paper) and its
   unobservable effort. Aiming to eliminate the negative effects on the
   green building market development caused by these two kinds of private
   information, we build a principal-agent model with asymmetric
   information. The optimal subsidy of the model is obtained by introducing
   the `spot check mechanism'. The results show that manufacturers with
   reasonable subsidies will not defraud the public about the actual
   quality of green buildings. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the
   probability of spot checks and subsidies on the optimal solution.
   Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the
   obtained results.},

Abstract = {The advancing digitization and related topics such as Industry 4.0 are
   becoming increasingly important for companies. Digital Twin is one of
   the most popular terms in the context of Industry 4.0. While not new,
   this approach has been brought to life with recent technological
   advances. Digital twins of products should help to analyze their life
   cycle and optimize development, operation, and service processes. For
   that, the necessary data must be collected and stored throughout the
   product life cycle and can also be provided for other tasks. The data is
   usually available in different formats and at different endpoints.
   Collection and integration of data into existing information systems are
   also complicated due to the typically large amount of data and typically
   manageable only with great effort. The structure and design of the
   digital twin are currently not standardized. Different are the
   structures, scope, and design methods. Regardless of building techniques
   and structure, a digital twin building platform must be defined to bring
   together models and data from different disciplines and to ensure the
   benefit of using the digital twin. In the present work, the various
   platforms that can be used to create a digital twin are examined and
   compared, since each platform has advantages and disadvantages.},

Title = {Occupant centric energy renovation strategy for hospital and restaurant
   building envelop using distinct modellingtools: A case study from
   low-income cultural context},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {A building envelope has a significant influence on the overall energy
   consumption of a building. Presently, Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) and Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tools are advanced and
   cost-efficient options for analyzing and improving the energy-efficient
   building envelop. However, existing BIM-BPS-based studies incorporate
   several buildings envelop parameters that account for static occupancy
   profiles. This contributes to higher discrepancies between the actual
   and simulated energy consumption. Also there is a dearth of studies
   about the hospital and restaurant building envelop by considering the
   local construction materials. Thus, the key aim of this study is to
   perform a stochastic occupant-centric building energy assessment for
   hospital and restaurant building envelop using agent based modelling
   (ABM) and BIM-BPS tools. Initially, stochastic occupancy, HVAC and
   lighting ON/OFF profiles were generated using a robust ABM-BIM approach
   followed by the real-time data gathering for verifications and energy
   model construction. Afterwards, the building energy performance was
   eval-uated using the BPS tools, while initial energy consumption data
   was calibrated using the pre-installed smart meter data in Chittagong,
   Bangladesh. The study also empowers the assessments of CO2 reduction,
   carbon credits, life cycle, and payback time analysis from the
   sustainable built environment perspective. The findings show the highest
   amount of monthly energy-saving for the hospital (Case 3) and restaurant
   (Case 3) buildings around 37.42 \% (July) and 32.52 \% (October),
   respectively, while considering the local envelop materials. Moreover,
   the maximum amount of CO2 reduction was 17.71 tons/year and 12.31
   tons/year, and the equivalent earned carbon credits were 88,539.5
   BDT/year and 61,524.1 BDT/year for hospital and restaurant buildings
   respectively. Additionally, the study calculates the payback period for
   both buildings by considering different local envelop materials. The
   findings of this study have presented a new framework between ABM, BIM
   and BPS based building envelop simulation, and contribute to proper
   building envelop material selection in low-income cultural contexts.
   Lastly, the study has pro-vided areas for further studies such as the
   need for a comprehensive model construction process, seasonal occupancy
   patterns, climatic factors, and composite materials study for different
   envelop systems which serves as limitations of this current study.(c)

Title = {Parametric building information modelling and optimality criteria
   methods for automated multi-objective optimisation of structural and
   energy efficiency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Modern high-rise buildings have complex and irregular envelope
   geometrics, which pose large uncertainty on the structural behaviour and
   energy performance. There have been limited attempts, and previous
   studies which targeted the optimisation of structural elements did not
   address the association of individual elements with the envelope shape
   of the overall building. This study presents a new Parametric BIM-based
   Optimality Criteria (PBIM-OC) method that enables multi-objective
   optimisation of envelope shape and element size for tall buildings. The
   study proposes a comprehensive parameterisation method to describe the
   complex geometrics of envelope shapes for high-rise buildings. The
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and multi-objective
   genetic algorithm (MOGA) were used to conduct multi-objective
   optimisation, providing optimal solutions for envelope shapes that
   maximise structural cost and operating energy efficiencies. The
   illustrative examples show a structurally inefficient building shape
   design can lead to a 60\% of structural cost difference. This study
   contributes a new parametric optimisation method that explores optimal
   designs and investigates the influence of geometric changes in building
   envelopes on performance solutions. The results provide insights into
   the relationship between building envelopes and structural efficiency,
   highlighting the trade-off between structural material cost and energy
   performance of high-rise buildings. Overall, this research provides
   valuable information for the construction industry to design tall
   buildings that are more efficient and cost-effective.},

Abstract = {The concept of a successful building project should be implemented
   across the project's lifecycle phases to obtain maximum profits without
   compromising the standard. Although BIM implementation in developing
   countries is limited, much research has focused on BIM drivers. However,
   there is less evidence to thoroughly investigate the influence of BIM
   barriers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study addresses
   barriers to BIM implementation in building projects in developing
   countries. It investigates the influence of BIM barriers on awareness of
   BIM during the project lifecycle. Thus, a comprehensive literature
   review is required to build a conceptual model. Subsequently, the
   Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was
   developed using a questionnaire survey tool. Data were collected from 90
   building experts in Nigeria. The model's outputs highlighted that cost
   and standards, process and economic, technology and business, and
   training and people are the most critical barriers to BIM implementation
   that should be avoided. Furthermore, the model prediction revealed that
   eliminating BIM barriers has a minor impact on sufficient knowledge
   throughout the building project lifecycle. The findings provide the
   basis for policy making in developing countries concerning the
   successful completion of projects by avoiding BIM barriers; it will
   likewise enhance the success of building projects through BIM.},

Abstract = {As a developing country and according to the situations of war and siege
   experienced by it Syria has a good percentage of the Middle East nations
   in the field of adopting new technologies and systems. This research
   demonstrates the awareness of BIM between Syrian engineers in the public
   sector and the possibility of mandating BIM in the near future. A
   quantitative statistic did achieve the research aim using both open and
   closed questionnaire. The research showed that Syrian construction and
   engineering workers know a little about the BIM. However, more than 44
   \% via 89 respondents reported that the full adoption of BIM in Syria
   will be within the next five years with the emphasis on the need to
   develop the BIM standard before the start. About 61 \% of the
   respondents believe that BIM can be useful in the design stage, while 21
   \% indicated that they can implement BIM in both design and construction
   stage of the project. Whatever the case, 49 \% of respondents found that
   BIM can solve 50-75 \% of the current building problems. Respondents
   identified the most expected benefits of BIM, also barriers and
   challenges that hinder the application of BIM: economic, technical,
   organizational, legal and human challenges. In addition to that, the
   risks were explained that may occur within the projects implemented
   using BIM. This study in association with Syrian organizations and
   universities showed the tendency towards the philosophy of building
   information modeling for the new generation of Syrian engineering. About
   37 \% of the respondents considered Syria government to be the main
   engine for the BIM adoptions; while more than 22 \% believe that the
   designer is the main engine to adopt and convince others about the
   benefits of BIM during the building projects life cycle. Unfortunately,
   due to the lack of the budget allocated for the training and
   rehabilitation of employees, or fear of the high cost of adopting this
   technology and the use of programs 31 \% of staff rely on self-training,
   and only 24 \% of them receive formal training in addition to their
   effort. Researchers believe that this research will be the first step
   towards soft moving to BIM in Syrian projects.},

Title = {OVERVIEW OF BIM CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE: REVIEW AND
   BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {500-514},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a revolutionary invention within
   the construction industry that essentially aids the design, construction
   and management of construction projects throughout their lifespan.
   Globally, the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry
   has for decades progressively adopted and implemented BIM. While there
   are several papers in this context, none have tried to extensively
   document BIM's comprehensive contributions and uses in the construction
   phase. Therefore, this paper aims to identify BIM's various
   contributions and uses in the construction phase and analyze publication
   trends, co-occurring keywords, contributing authors and countries. A
   systematic overview approach was used to review published articles on
   state-of-the-art of BIM in construction, supported by bibliometric
   network mapping analysis. A total of 409 documents were extracted and
   analyzed. The study's findings document BIM's various uses and
   contributions to the AEC industry, such as simulation of each stage of
   the construction process, virtual presentation of the building and site,
   visualization of progress, management of construction work, enhancement
   of safety, communication and collaboration, quick generation of reliable
   and accurate cost estimates, assistance in the fast realization of
   return on investment (ROI), and serving as a platform that hosts and
   documents various technological tools used during the construction
   phase. The bibliometric analysis reveals the most contributing scholars,
   countries, document sources, trend network mapping of co-occurring
   keywords, and publication trends. The primary practical implications of
   this study's discoveries can be exploited as a basis for further
   research and to influence the future direction of BIM in the AEC
   industry. The findings will enhance the wider spread, application and
   understanding of BIM in the AEC industry, thereby increasing BIM
   awareness and knowledge globally.},

Title = {Building information modeling and complementary technologies in heritage
   buildings: A bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Maintaining heritage buildings requires a delicate balance between
   preserving their history and implementing modern construction practices.
   Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) is a technology that has
   made significant strides in preserving and efficiently managing cultural
   and architectural structures. HBIM enables the documentation of historic
   buildings and improves decision -making throughout the life cycle of
   such assets. However, despite the progress made in this field, more
   studies that comprehensively analyze the current state of knowledge and
   the specific trends driving the adoption of HBIM in this context need to
   be conducted. Therefore, this study aims to examine the adoption of HBIM
   and its interaction with complementary technologies in heritage
   buildings through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis. The research
   method consisted of five main stages: (1) scope definition, (2)
   selection of bibliometric data analysis techniques, (3) data collection,
   (4) execution of bibliometric analysis, and (5) evidence analysis and
   synthesis. The analysis was conducted on 433 documents published between
   2008 and 2023 concerning the adoption of HBIM in heritage buildings. The
   results show impressive progress in HBIM, revealing the utilization of
   advanced technologies in data collection to create detailed models.
   Notably, significant developments have been made in restoring structures
   that focus on sustainability. Techniques such as photogrammetry, laser
   applications, and 3D modeling are being incorporated. These findings
   provide valuable information on the advancements, patterns, and emerging
   technologies in HBIM for preserving and maintaining historic buildings.
   Researchers can utilize this information to shape future research with
   an up-to-date and international perspective.},

Abstract = {In July 2015 the Spanish Ministry of Public Works launched the es.BIM
   Commission in order to implement Building Information Modeling (BIM) in
   Spain. The commission was created not only to promote the implementation
   of BIM in the Spanish construction sector, but also to encourage its use
   throughout the life cycle of civil and building constructions and to
   establish the way construction technicians will be trained.
   In addition, the es. BIM Commission established a milestone for the year
   2020 were all public facilities and infrastructure projects --for both
   new construction and rehabilitation--, must be presented with BIM.
   Despite the BIM initiative has been launched, Spain is taking a
   considerable delay in the adoption of this methodology.
   For this reason, the School of Building Construction (ETSEM) of the
   Technical University of Madrid (UPM) has decided to go ahead and
   anticipate the possible solution of commitment towards BIM training in
   the University. For this reason, a project to be implemented over the
   next four academic years of the Building Construction Degree was
   designed.
   The project was divided into several stages: a first stage comprising
   the dissemination of the project, a second stage focused on lecturers'
   training and finally a third stage focused on students' training. The
   students' training will be achieved, course by course, through several
   BIM Workshops associated with specific subjects.
   This paper presents the results achieved during the first year of the
   project's implementation. In particular, results from the teachers'
   training and the first BIM Workshop implementation in the subject
   ``Introduction to Construction{''}, are presented and discussed.
   The results show that students have a strong interest in BIM issues and
   are eager to advance their knowledge in BIM methodology. It is therefore
   important to involve lecturers from other subjects in order to provide
   more BIM workshops of specific contents. This will promote the formation
   of multidisciplinary workshops to enhance students' collaborative work
   using BIM methodology. Finally, it is necessary to conduct a review and
   update the existing School Teaching Plans in order to include BIM
   competencies in the skills of graduate Building ConstruYction Degrees.},

Abstract = {The current computer technology facilitates the processing of large
   volumes of information in architectural design teams, in parallel with
   recent advances in-flight automation in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   along with lower costs, facilitates their use to capture aerial
   photographs and obtain orthophotographs and 3D models of relief and
   terrain textures. With these technologies, 3D models can be produced
   that allow different geometric configurations of the distribution of
   construction elements on the ground to be analyzed. This article
   presents the process of implementation in a terrain integrated into the
   early stages of architectural design. A methodology is proposed that
   covers the detailed capture of terrain, the relationship with the
   architectural design environment, and its implementation on the plot. As
   a novelty, an inverse perspective to the remaining disciplines is
   presented, from the inside of the object to the outside. The proposed
   methodology for the use of UAVs integrates terrain capture, generation
   of the 3D mesh, superimposition of environmental realities and
   architectural design using building information modeling (BIM)
   technologies. In addition, it represents the beginning of a line of
   research on the implementation of the plot and the layout of foundations
   using UAVs. The results obtained in the study carried out in three
   different projects comparing traditional technologies with the
   integration of UAVs + BIM show a clear improvement in the second option.
   The use of new technologies applied to the execution and control of work
   not only improves accuracy but also reduces errors and saves time, which
   undoubtedly indicates significant savings in costs and deviations in the
   project.},

Title = {``Papering{''} Over Space and Place: Product Carbon Footprint Modeling
   in the Global Paper Industry},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS},

Abstract = {We are witnessing an explosion in carbon calculators for estimating the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., carbon footprint) of households,
   buildings, cities, and processes. Seeking to capitalize on the emergent
   ogreeno consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon
   footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon
   frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale,
   largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in
   globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly
   demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., biofuel
   production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle
   assessment (LCA)the principal method behind product-level GHG emissions
   footprint protocolsfrequently avoids these challenges by narrowly
   delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the omessinesso of
   space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and
   emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how
   complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change
   create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using
   industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information
   system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed
   pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with
   land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their
   integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled
   human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space
   dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to
   contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which
   to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers.},

Title = {A Review of Passive Solar Heating and Cooling Technologies Based on
   Bioclimatic and Vernacular Architecture},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increase in global average temperature, mainly due to the high rate
   of greenhouse gas emissions, has triggered severe global warming and
   climate change. In Europe, the building sector accounts for a
   significant portion of emissions and energy consumption, prompting
   attention on nearly-zero-energy buildings (nZEBs) and zero-carbon
   buildings, as they play a pivotal role in reaching the goal of climate
   neutrality by 2050. Passive systems offer a promising solution,
   optimizing energy usage by better adapting buildings to their local
   climates. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of passive heating and
   cooling techniques, exploring their contributions to contemporary
   architecture and showcasing their features and adaptability across
   different climates. Furthermore, the link between traditional and
   bioclimatic architecture is assessed. Recent years have witnessed a
   surge in publications on bioclimatic solar passive strategies,
   reflecting an intensified debate on climate change. Europe leads
   research in this area, aligned with initiatives like the Green Deal and
   Fit for 55. While dynamic simulation software is widely utilized for
   energy efficiency analysis, there remains limited integration of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and life cycle analysis (LCA) tools,
   which could enhance holistic assessments.},

Title = {Digital Twin Research in the AECO-FM Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current
   patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM)
   industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A
   bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from
   the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent
   scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the
   research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range
   of research from model-based information management to building
   information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings
   and smart cities. The `virtual-physical building integration', `building
   lifecycle management', and `information integrated production' subjects
   are highly in the focus of the research field. While `information-based
   predictive management' and `virtual-based information utilization'
   studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the
   AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of
   digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance
   throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns,
   gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and
   contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation
   approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge. The
   sample size is a limitation for this research since it is relatively
   small due to the newness of the subject. Future studies may include data
   related to practice-oriented innovations and industry-initiated
   improvements to achieve broader and more informed results.},

Abstract = {Wood products are gaining interest in the building sector, due to their
   potential in sequestering greenhouse gas emissions. However, increasing
   wood materials use in the built market can have unforeseen changes in
   the material supply chains. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA)
   allows the assessment of changes in material supply chain. To quantify
   and link those consequences, the affected physical flows need to be
   estimated. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) can bring to CLCA modelling more
   representative and quantitative information than the commonly used
   hypothesis in consequential modelling. Indeed, MFA considers physical
   constraints (technology performances and material availability), in
   addition to account for mass balance. The main objective of this
   presentation is to illustrate how such consistency is added to CLCA
   through an MFA of wood products in non-residential (NR) buildings in the
   province of Quebec (Canada). Wood flows are tracked to identify their
   end-use markets and trends in consumption. To overcome the lack of data
   and bring insights on the sector's dynamics, such as stock variations
   and potential discarded flows that supply recycling markets, residence
   time model and also extrapolation and correlation between physical and
   economic parameters are used. Results show how flows can increase in the
   market before reaching their physical constraints, such as the available
   wood stock in the forest. These insights will significantly enhance the
   data collection for CLCA. In conclusion, the MFA brings support to CLCA
   by proposing a framework to model changes in the construction market.},

Title = {Development of A BIM-Based Maintenance Decision-Making Framework for the
   Optimization between Energy Efficiency and Investment Costs},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Eco-friendly materials have been developed recently that have made it
   possible to significantly reduce the maintenance cost of buildings when
   they are appropriately used in renovation. Indeed, it became extremely
   important to consider the eco-friendly energy-saving effects on design
   alternatives during renovation. The present study proposes a framework
   for the optimum maintenance decision-making model for considering
   eco-friendly energy to help people interested in making decisions
   concerning renovation; it requires that both the environmental
   friendliness and economic feasibility of the target building be
   simultaneously considered. Several studies mainly cover the structural
   aspects for energy improvements based on innovation and technology.
   However, energy simulation in existing buildings needs some additional
   consideration regarding the economic analysis of energy savings and the
   recovery period of construction costs. A case study was conducted as a
   research method by utilizing the proposed framework, which aims to: (1)
   make energy simulations with different basic design assumptions; (2)
   perform the energy simulations through building information modeling
   (BIM) technology; and (3) analyze the economic feasibility of the
   alternatives. As a result, an alternative combination that can save the
   net maximum energy cost during the life cycle period and invest the
   lowest renovation costs has been recommended. Furthermore, effective
   guidelines were proposed on which items the building owner values,
   depending on his economic investment conditions in decision-making
   regarding the level of design, through a comprehensive review of the
   energy savings by design variable. It is expected that the research
   findings will be utilized in the decision-making process and for
   conducting further relevant research in future.},

Title = {A semi-automatic image-based object recognition system for constructing
   as-is IFC BIM objects based on fuzzy-MAUT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Month = {2019 MAY 18},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) could support different activities
   throughout the life cycle of a building and has been widely applied in
   design and construction phases nowadays. However, BIM has not been
   widely implemented in the operation and maintenance (O\&M) phase. As-is
   information for the majority of existing buildings is not complete and
   even outdated or incorrect. Lack of accurate and complete as-is
   information is still one of the key reasons leading to the low-level
   efficiency in O\&M. BIM performs as an intelligent platform and a
   database that stores, links, extracts and exchanges information in
   construction projects. It has shown promising opportunities and
   advantages in BIM applications for the improvement in O\&M. Hence, an
   effective and convenient approach to record as-is conditions of the
   existing buildings and create as-is BIM objects would be the essential
   step for improving efficiency and effectiveness of O\&M, and furthermore
   possibly refurbishment of the building. Many researchers have paid
   attention to different systems and approaches for automated and
   real-time object recognition in past decades. This paper summarizes
   state-of-the-art statistical matching-based object recognition methods
   and then presents the image-based Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM
   object creation application, which extracts object information by simply
   conducting point-and-click operations. Furthermore, the object
   recognition research system is introduced, including recognizing
   structure object types and their corresponding materials. This paper
   combines the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) with the fuzzy set
   theory to be Fuzzy-MAUT, since the MAUT allows complex and powerful
   combinations of various criteria and fuzzy set theory assists improving
   the performance of this system. With the goal of creating an effective
   method for as-is IFC BIM objects construction, this image-based object
   recognition system and its recognition process are further validated and
   tested. Key challenges and promising opportunities are also addressed.},

Title = {Seismic-Energy Retrofit as Information-Value: Axiological Programming
   for the Ecological Transition},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The research deals with the issue of the seismic and energy retrofit of
   historic building fabrics having as reference a historic district of
   Syracuse (Italy). The prospect of the ecological transition on the one
   hand and the public support funding on the other claim for a valuation
   programming approach implying the creation of multiple scenarios, each
   of which is inspired by a different and complementary degree of
   ``saliency and urgency{''}. These two dimensions of ``being worth{''} by
   a building aggregation having an its own shape and belonging to a larger
   and more complex urban system need to be addressed according to some
   axiological reference, in this case, the concerns of the efficiency and
   fairness of public spending. This experience concerns the creation of a
   value-based programming pattern of the seismic-energy retrofit process
   framed in a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment aimed at
   identifying the best intervention strategy among the several ones that
   can be generated in the logic of the parametric design. Both seismic and
   energy retrofit expected performances, in fact, can be scaled,
   complementing the extension and intensity of the interventions. This
   experiment takes advantage of the BIM multidimensional logic in line
   with the multiple scales and purposes implied by the relationships
   between individual/communal axiological profiles and present/future
   prospects. The experiment consists of the creation of an additive
   cost-oriented design platform based on which the different and
   progressive combinations of intensity and extension of the interventions
   can be compared and selected.},

Title = {BIM methodology for cost analysis, sustainability, and management of
   steel structures with reconfigurable joints for industrial structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {One of the main objectives set for future factories, and for Industry
   4.0, is to reduce the CO2 footprint of industrial plants and their
   buildings as much as possible. This objective must be compatible with
   economic savings, an essential requirement for investments in industrial
   production plants and their buildings. Industrial structures represent
   an important part of investments in industrial facilities and equipment.
   In order to achieve the objectives mentioned above, it is necessary to
   use fully reconfigurable and reusable structures. This work aims to
   propose and apply a methodology using BIM (Building Information
   Modelling) technology that allows for the analysis, control, and
   monitoring of economic profitability and sustainability ratios over time
   (for structures with reconfigurable joints compared to those with welded
   joints). The proposed methodology was applied to three different case
   studies, where various reconfigurations of the structures were done over
   time, obtaining the structure's economic profitability with
   reconfigurable joints from the third reconfiguration and environmental
   sustainability from the second reconfiguration. The results demonstrate
   that the BIM methodology presented in this work and applied to
   industrial structures is a fully adequate tool for analyzing the
   structures' costs and sustainability and controlling for monitoring
   these structures throughout the different reconfigurations.},

Abstract = {Information technology tools and methods have been in use in building
   industry for over three decades. Utilization of IT tools such as
   computer-aided design applications in the building design phase is
   pervasive. However, CAD drawings do not suffice the requirements of
   effective building models. IAI IFC models have been introduced as means
   of providing a higher level of data integrity and utilization potential
   in all phases of the building life cycle. In this context, International
   Framework for Dictionaries (IFD) can enrich design tools with
   specifications beyond geometric information (e.g. material,
   construction, schedules). These libraries can be equipped with
   ontologies and shared on the web. Having a semantically enriched,
   searchable library of building products can support designers to
   efficiently select those products that best match design constraints and
   criteria pertaining to specific projects. In this paper, we will present
   a case study of an IFD library for a specific building component
   (skylights) that has been implemented based on Semantic Web technologies

Title = {Sustainable Ventilation Strategies for a Medium-Sized Space with
   Regional Effect},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The analysis of ventilation strategies is fundamentally affected by
   regional climate conditions and local cost databases, in terms of energy
   consumption, CO2 emission and cost-effective analysis. A systematic
   approach is covered in this paper to estimate a local economic and
   environmental impact on a medium-sized space located in two regions
   during supply-and-installation and operation phases. Three ventilation
   strategies, including mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation
   (DV) and stratum ventilation (SV) were applied to medium-sized
   air-conditioned space with this approach. The trend of the results for
   three ventilation systems in the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life
   cycle cost (LCC) analysis is SV < DV < MV. The result of CO2 emission
   and regional LCC shows that SV is the lowest one in both regional
   studies. In comparison with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
   (HKSAR) during 20 Service years, the case analysis demonstrates that the
   percentage differences in LCC analysis of MV, DV \& SV in Guangdong are
   less than 20.5\%, 19.4\% and 18.82\% respectively. Their CO2 emission of
   MV, DV and SV in Guangdong are more than HKSAR in 10.69\%, 11.22\% and
   12.05\%, respectively. The present study could provide information about
   regional effects in the LCA and LCC analysis of three ventilation
   strategies emissions, and thereby help set up models for decision-making
   on high efficiency and cost-effective ventilation strategy plans.},

Abstract = {The increasing global industrialization and over-exploitation of fossil
   fuels has induced the release of greenhouse gases, leading to an
   increase in global temperature and causing environmental issues. There
   is therefore an urgent necessity to reach net-zero carbon emissions.
   Only 4.5\% of countries have achieved carbon neutrality, and most
   countries are still planning to do so by 2050-2070. Moreover, synergies
   between different countries have hampered synergies between adaptation
   and mitigation policies, as well as their co-benefits. Here, we present
   a strategy to reach a carbon neutral economy by examining the outcome
   goals of the 26th summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference
   of the Parties (COP 26). Methods have been designed for mapping carbon
   emissions, such as input-output models, spatial systems, geographic
   information system maps, light detection and ranging techniques, and
   logarithmic mean divisia. We present decarbonization technologies and
   initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, and we discuss carbon
   trading and carbon tax. We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as
   shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, and the
   development of low-carbon technologies, low-carbon agriculture, changing
   dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste.
   Developing resilient buildings and cities, introducing decentralized
   energy systems, and the electrification of the transportation sector is
   also necessary. We also review the life cycle analysis of carbon neutral
   systems.},

Abstract = {Multi-criteria-decision-making is a very effective tool for decision
   making in complex infrastructure projects.
   Building-information-modelling (BIM) and integrated-project-delivery
   (IPD) are adopted by the architecture engineering and construction
   industry because of their notable benefits to complex infrastructure
   projects throughout their project life cycle. Poor knowledge of the KPIs
   hinders integrated BIM and IPD adoption which results in affecting
   project timelines and budgets. This paper aims at evaluating the key
   performance indicators (KPI) of IPD and BIM for an infrastructure
   project of a metro rail construction located in western India. After an
   extensive literature review and experts' opinions, a list of 24 KPI was
   identified. Further, factor comparison method and fuzzy decision-making
   trial and evaluation laboratory were utilized to prioritize the
   identified KPIs and disclose their interrelationships based on
   influential weight, respectively. The findings revealed the 16 most
   critical key performance indicators (MCKPI) which are vital for BIM and
   IPD adoption in highly complex infrastructure projects. Their
   interrelationship was represented by a causal diagram showing cause and
   effects groups. The results indicated the four most influential and
   critical KPIs. They were accessibility and accuracy of information by
   BIM, facilitating access to real-time data, interoperability and
   compatibility of data, and minimizing claims and disputes. Hence, more
   consideration should be given to the MCKPIs to enhance the project
   performance of complex infrastructure projects like metro rail
   construction.},

Title = {A systematic taxonomic review of the application of BIM and digital
   twins technologies in the construction industry},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 23},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transition
   from Building Information Modelling (BIM) to digital twins (DT) in the
   construction industry. Specifically, the research explores the current
   state (themes and trends) and future directions of this emerging
   research domain.Design/methodology/approachA multi-stage approach was
   employed that combines scientometric and systematic review approaches.
   The scientometric analysis involves quantitative assessment of
   scientific publications retrieved from the Web of Science database -
   using software tools like VOSviewer and HistCite. The systematic review
   involved a rigorous synthesis and evaluation of the existing literature
   to identify research gaps, themes, clusters and future directions.
   Clusters obtained from the scientometric analysis of the co-occurrence
   network were then used as a subject base for a systematic
   study.FindingsEmergent findings reveal a rapidly growing interest in
   BIM-DT integration, with over 90\% of publications since 2020. The
   United Kingdom, China and Italy are the leading contributing countries.
   Five prominent research clusters identified are: (1) Construction 4.0
   technologies; (2) smart cities and urban environments; (3) heritage BIM
   and laser scanning; (4) asset and facility management; and (5) energy
   and sustainability. The study highlights the potential of BIM-DT
   integration for enhancing project delivery, asset management and
   sustainability practices in the built environment. Moreover, the
   project's life cycle operation phase has garnered the most attention
   from researchers in this field compared to other
   phases.Originality/valueThis unique study is comprehensive in its
   approach by combining scientometric and systematic methods to provide a
   quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the BIM-DT research
   landscape. Unlike previous reviews that focused solely on facility
   management, this study's scope covers the entire construction sector. By
   identifying research gaps, challenges and future directions, this study
   establishes a solid foundation for researchers exploring this emerging
   field and envisions the future landscape of BIM-DT integration in the
   built environment.},

Abstract = {Accounting for around 40\% of total energy consumption, buildings in
   industrialized countries are a particular focus for saving energy.
   Especially digital twins and building information modeling (BIM) can
   serve as a mean to improve operational processes, detect faulty
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) components which lead to an
   increased energy consumption and evaluate future renovation
   possibilities during a buildings life cycle. To enable these advantages
   a transition from existing HVAC diagrams to a machine-readable
   representation including spatial and functional interrelationship of all
   components as well as their semantic relationship is necessary.
   Especially in retrofit cases the manual transition is a time-intensive
   and an error prone process. The present work aims to develop a procedure
   for the (partially) automated recognition of HVAC diagrams and
   extraction of information about their intercorrelation. In order to
   achieve the desired results, we use multiple approaches of computer
   vision, both conventional as well as more recent ones using artificial
   intelligence such as ``Faster R-CNN{''}. The developed pipeline consists
   of three basic steps: Find symbols of components, find connecting lines,
   combine the extracted information into a machine-readable
   representation. Due to privacy issues, only very few real diagrams are
   available. To evaluate our approach we developed a data generator to
   train and test our pipeline. The obtained results show that to a large
   extend it is already possible to transfer relevant information from
   technical diagrams into a machine-readable format in order to reduce the
   effort of creating and validating digital twins and BIM for retrofits.},

Abstract = {Cultural heritage (CH) preservation and management play vital roles in
   conserving valuable properties and facilitating relevant historical
   studies on a country. The advanced technologies developed for CH
   preservation and management in recent years have made CH digitalization
   and documentation easy and have generated tremendous amounts of data for
   a wide range of applications. However, a great focus remains on the
   large amount of CH data, particularly on CH semantic interoperability,
   because various standards or schemas are applied during data generation.
   To achieve 3D CH semantic interoperability, this study proposes and
   comprehensively discusses an ontology-based approach for 3D tangible CH
   that includes 3D models, metadata, and their restoration information in
   the entire life cycle of the building information model (BIM). A
   tangible cultural heritage ontology is developed based on a top-level
   ontology, namely, the CIDOC conceptual reference model (CRM), for
   heritage information, metadata, and restoration. Access is achieved by
   mapping from the designated heritage in the national cultural heritage
   database with DC-based metadata to CIDOC CRM and from an enriched
   Heritage BIM with restoration information encoded as industry foundation
   classes (IFC) ontology to CIDOC CRM. The proposed framework can
   successfully combine a 3D model and its enriched information and is
   available for 3D model semantic accessing and integration. We focus on
   the discussion of Taiwan's traditional Southern Fujian architecture.},

Title = {Identification and Prioritization of Factors Affecting the Overall
   Project Cost of Healthcare Facilities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Planning for the delivery of a healthcare facility requires the
   management of a complex array of data variables that affect the
   development of the project scope and its cost estimate. The timing of
   key decisions can significantly affect costs; therefore, the early
   identification of factors that influence overall project costs is of
   paramount importance to healthcare facility owners. This study
   identifies and prioritizes key factors affecting healthcare facility
   costs based on the analysis of data collected from multiple projects.
   The database used for this study included information on project
   characteristics, building parameters, dimensions, and costs covering
   several phases of the project life cycle, from programming to
   activation. Initially, the study identified project characteristics and
   building parameters that influence overall owner project costs. Then,
   several quantitative methods were employed to rank these factors based
   on how they influence overall project costs. In the end, this study
   distinguished 39 healthcare-specific factors from 62 factors
   investigated in the research. Finally, it ranked the top 11 building
   factors that affect the overall costs of a healthcare project. (C) 2019

Title = {An IDM-Based Approach for Information Requirement in Prefabricated
   Construction},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Prefabricated construction promotes providing better productivity and
   project results. Building models, including their elements' fabrication
   details, are complex structures that need accurate information delivery
   among the project participants and their partial designs. This paper
   extends the IFC data model to support prefabricated construction. Also,
   it discusses the advantages of systematically managing exchange
   requirements in a database to facilitate generating IDM (Information
   Delivery Manual). The paper first introduces a BIM-based collaborative
   work mode by sharing and extracting the model views. The core of the
   sharing is the establishment of view exchange standard about the linked
   model and the definition of exchange requirements based on the design
   process, leading to the formulation of the IDM standard again from the
   perspective of the actual design. Process maps covering architecture,
   structure, plumbing, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering
   are made to show how to realize BIM-based collaborative work. Then the
   exchange requirements referred to the object and attribute of the BIM
   model which should be delivered in a special phase are defined in
   particular tables. To facilitate the automation of managing and
   exchanging requirements, a database management system is designed with
   its corresponding user-interface, which enhances the collaboration and
   delivery throughout the project life cycle. The proposed approach
   supports better information reuse and delivery among the project
   participants.},

Title = {Prospects for digital twin technology in the building modular
   construction and operation phases: A game theory-based analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {470},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Modular construction and operation significantly impact building
   lifecycle management, with various stakeholders playing key roles.
   Digital twin technology emerges as a cutting-edge tool for information
   exchange, management, and forecasting in the construction sector,
   offering comprehensive services for diverse stakeholders. However,
   research primarily explores potential applications and practical
   solutions, with limited focus on application strategies considering all
   stakeholders' interests. This gap hinders the transition of digital twin
   technology from theoretical to practical use. Addressing this, the paper
   employs game theory to develop models that analyze key stakeholder
   decisions during the modular construction and operational phases. It
   creatively introduces mathematical models for complex conditions in the
   operation phase and conducts numerical simulations. Findings show that
   the diffusion rate of digital twin technology significantly affects
   decision-making by main stakeholders in the construction industries in
   two stages. The diffusion rate in other industries influences the
   decision of facility management contractors from different backgrounds,
   yet its implementation ultimately depends on their status and
   profitability during the operation process. These diffusion rates are
   influenced by various factors like government subsidies, development
   costs, and revenues. To enhance the application rate of digital twin
   technology, the paper suggests initiating pilot projects, creating
   project pools, expanding industryuniversity-research collaborations, and
   implementing subsidies and incentive programs.},

Title = {Adoption of building information modeling in Chinese construction
   industry The technology-organization-environment framework},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1878-1898},
Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is recognized as a major
   innovation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   industry. Understanding the factors that influence the AEC's adoption of
   BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study provides empirical evidence for
   the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of
   Chinese construction industry. Based on the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation
   diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that
   integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of
   BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese
   construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets
   from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and
   conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach.
   Findings - The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a
   major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was
   an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant
   antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was
   significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction
   firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant
   impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more
   likely to adopt BIM.
   Originality/value - One of the first to apply the TOE framework to
   integrate three groups of factors that may explain BIM adoption in
   China. Such a comprehensive framework provides a much broader
   perspective of BIM adoption to evaluate the impacts of different
   antecedent factors. The authors conducted an empirical study based on
   survey data collected from two different types of companies, i.e.,
   engineering consulting firms and construction firms, representing the
   two parties in the principal-agent relationship of a construction
   project. One of the first to apply a sophisticated statistical approach,
   i.e., partial least squares, to analyze the data in the BIM literature.},

Abstract = {The new construction that is projected to take place between 2020 and
   2040 plays a critical role in embodied carbon emissions. The change in
   material selection is inversely proportional to the budget as the
   project progresses. Given the fact that early-stage design processes
   often do not include environmental performance metrics, there is an
   opportunity to investigate a toolset that enables early-stage design
   processes to integrate this type of analysis into the preferred workflow
   of concept designers. The value here is that early-stage environmental
   feedback can inform the crucial decisions that are made in the
   beginning, giving a greater chance for a building with better
   environmental performance in terms of its life cycle. This paper
   presents the development of a tool called LearnCarbon, as a plugin of
   Rhino3d, used to educate architects and engineers in the early stages
   about the environmental impact of their design. It facilitates two
   neural networks trained with the Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study by
   Carbon Leadership Forum, which learns the relationship between building
   geometry, typology, and construction type with the Global Warming
   potential (GWP) in tons of C02 equivalent (tCO2e). The first one, a
   regression model, can predict the GWP based on the massing model of a
   building, along with information about typology and location. The second
   one, a classification model, predicts the construction type given a
   massing model and target GWP. LearnCarbon can help improve the building
   life cycle impact significantly through early predictions of the
   structure's material and can be used as a tool for facilitating
   sustainable discussions between the architect and the client.},

Abstract = {The Swedish Transport Administration manages approximately 17,000 road
   bridges and 4,000 railway bridges. The Swedish Transport
   Administration's Bridge and Tunnel Management System (BMS) provides
   support throughout the process from assessment to priority action list.
   All bridges are inspected at least every six years. The inspections are
   performed according to a special methodology and the bridge inspector
   assesses both the physical and functional state of a bridge. At
   maintenance planning for a bridge, the total measures needed for a
   bridge are described to ensure expected functionality at the lowest life
   cycle cost. Several alternative maintenance strategies are established
   and the BMS provides support in finding the strategy that provides the
   lowest social costs in order to maintain the functional standard. When
   available grants are ready, the BMS can present a list of what measures
   are proposed to be implemented in the coming years, usually 3-4 years.
   This prioritized list is then used in the continued work of defining the
   action list and for procurement to take place cost-effectively.
   The rapid technological development opens up opportunities for new
   innovative ways of managing bridges. Drones can be used to inspect
   bridges and BIM can be used to store the data from building, maintaining
   and inspections of bridges. BIM is used when new bridges are built but
   because of the high demands on persistent formats to store data for the
   whole life span of a bridge the model files currently can ` t be used as
   a record of the asset. Instead the BIM models are transferred to 2D
   drawings that can be stored in a way that can be guaranteed to last
   during the bridge's life time. The paper will describe how the Swedish
   Transport Administration currently are working with these subjects in
   research projects and standardization.},

Abstract = {The inspection of building components plays a crucial role in reducing
   maintenance costs throughout the building's life cycle. Many buildings
   suffer from defects in the building elements, such as surface problems,
   cracks, and moisture problems. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has
   become a widely used digital tool for the construction industry,
   allowing for the virtual visualization, design, and simulation of
   structures. At the same time, progress in neural networks, a branch of
   artificial intelligence, presents encouraging potential for
   classification and evaluation. This article explores the fusion of BIM
   and neural networks to improve and simplify the building inspection
   procedure. Neural networks are implemented with BIM to conduct real-time
   analysis and predictions as part of an inspection framework. A data set
   consisting of 500 wall samples with defects from different buildings was
   collected through fieldwork. These data were then classified into five
   categories, ranging from D1 (No damage) to D5 (Collapse), based on
   expert opinions. A neural network was used to create a model that can
   show the severity of degradation of building elements. The BIM platform
   is utilized in the implementation of the proposed model to facilitate
   the exchange of information and enhance documentation during inspection.
   The visualization provided by BIM allows the facility management team
   and building owners to assess building elements through causality
   analysis using distinct color codes. A case study of an office building
   is featured in the paper to showcase the application of the proposed
   model for asset management. The color-coded system used in this study
   denotes low-performance conditions as red, medium performance conditions
   as yellow, and high-performance conditions as green. This article
   outlines the procedures for categorizing and ranking defects in building
   elements, specifically focusing on walls.
   This study explores innovative methods for assessing the condition of
   buildings, aiming to improve accuracy, efficiency, and predictive
   capabilities. Traditional building inspections are often subjective,
   time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it challenging to generate
   consistent and comprehensive evaluations. Our research addresses these
   limitations by integrating BIM and neural networks. BIM provides
   detailed digital models of buildings, which include comprehensive
   information about each component. This technology enables precise and
   consistent assessments, reducing the subjectivity inherent in manual
   inspections. Neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence, can
   analyze complex data patterns and detect potential issues early,
   allowing for proactive maintenance. By combining these two technologies,
   our approach offers a more efficient and objective method for building
   condition assessment. This integration not only saves time and resources
   but also enhances the ability to predict and prevent future issues,
   ultimately extending the lifespan of building components and improving
   overall building performance. These advancements are particularly
   relevant for property managers, maintenance teams, and construction
   professionals seeking to optimize building maintenance and management
   practices. The findings of this study can significantly benefit the
   construction and facilities management industries by providing a more
   reliable and advanced method for maintaining building health and safety,
   thereby ensuring sustainable and cost-effective building management.},

Title = {On the potential of integrating building information modelling (BIM) for

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {321-343},
Abstract = {Purpose Additive manufacturing (AM) and building information modelling
   (BIM) are emerging trends for which it has been claimed that both
   increase both efficiency and productivity in the construction industry.
   This study aims to synthesise and aggregate the literature addressing
   BIM integration in the AM of concrete structures and to exploit the
   joint value creation potential.
   Design/methodology/approach This study firstly applies a mixed-review
   method to achieve mutual corroboration and interdependency between
   quantitative and qualitative research approaches. Bibliometric mapping
   is applied to identify, map and synthesise the relevant literature.
   Scoping review is used to examine the extent, gap, range and nature of
   the research activity. Afterward, a cross-situational analysis, the
   threats, opportunities, weaknesses and strengths(2) matrix, is proposed
   and applied to exploit the joint value creation potential of different
   aspects of AM and BIM.
   Findings The study reveals a substantial interest in this field.
   However, progress in terms of integration is slow compared to the rapid
   development in interest in the two trends individually. The literature
   discusses or conceptualises such integration at building-scale, while
   prototyping or proof-of-concept processes are only rarely used. The
   study identified 12 joint value creation potentials through the
   integration of BIM in AM for concrete structures, which can create value
   by enabling more optimised designs, automated construction processes and
   data analytics that can apply throughout the building life-cycle
   process.
   Originality/value The advancements of BIM integration in the AM of
   concrete structures are analysed and joint value creation potentials are
   proposed. The study proposes a cross-situation analysis that can be
   applied to structure joint value creation potentials from the
   multi-dimensional integration of different factors and topics,
   especially for emerging technologies.},

Abstract = {Among pathogens that affect tomato, Alternaria spp. are important due to
   their implications in yield losses and the contamination of tomato
   products by mycotoxins. In this study, a systematic literature review
   was conducted to retrieve and analyze available data on the
   Alternaria-tomato pathosystem, with particular attention focused on the
   main biological processes included in the pathogen life cycle and
   mycotoxin production. We considered 110 papers (selected from initial
   2,138 papers) on five Alternaria species that were historically related
   or recently identified to cause damage to tomato leafage and fruits.
   Published mathematical models related to Alternaria diseases in tomato
   were also screened based on their aim and development methods,
   highlighting the wide use of empirical approach. Retrieved information
   was also evaluated for applications in building a mechanistic,
   weather-driven model that incorporates the key steps of the pathogen
   life cycle. This systematic review highlights several knowledge gaps,
   including the effect of wetness on infection and environmental
   requirements for mycotoxin production, and suggests paths for further

Abstract = {In the era of the great development of information technologies and
   telecommunications, a natural need to develop and implement a unified
   system of digital building information modelling has arisen. The rapid
   development of design technology in the field of architecture,
   engineering and construction leads to the continuous adaptation of the
   conceptual apparatus for building information modelling (BIM). BIM
   technology adopts a new definition as a universal tool for describing
   various elements of intelligent virtual 3D model of a building combining
   a series of sequential steps related to the investment, such as
   requirements of design, construction, operation and demolition
   optimizations and preparations. In the paper, the authors propose
   directions of research in the field of BLM (Building Lifecycle
   Management). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Integrated assessment across building and urban scales: A review and
   proposal for a more holistic, multi-scale, system-of-systems approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Humanity is facing major societal challenges that are complex and
   systemic in the nature of their drivers, interactions, and impacts.
   Because buildings and cities play a substantial role in these societal
   challenges, we need reliable approaches that can be used to assess their
   resilience and sustainability. Given that building and urban systems are
   usually tightly coupled, we critically review nine building-scale
   assessment frameworks and seven urban-scale assessment frameworks,
   ranking them from high to low in terms of the causality among component
   systems. We identify four major knowledge gaps that, to varying degrees,
   span the entire range of assessment frameworks: (1) causality among
   component systems and their subsystems is limited; (2) sustainability
   and resilience are too narrowly defined; (3) social systems are
   inadequately addressed; and (4) building-and urban scale assessments are
   poorly connected. To address these limitations, we briefly introduce
   several closely-related fields of research including integrated
   assessment and modeling, social-ecological systems research, land
   systems science, socio-environmental systems modeling, modeling of human
   behavior, multi-scale modeling, and multi fidelity modeling. Building on
   these rapidly emerging research domains, we conclude by proposing a more
   holistic, multi-scale, system-of-systems approach that connects across
   building and urban scales using several common systems.},

Title = {Policy Making Should Consider Time-Dependent Greenhouse Gas Benefits of
   Transit-Oriented Smart Growth},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2015},
Number = {2502},
Pages = {53-61},
Abstract = {Cities are developing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation plans and
   reduction targets on the basis of a growing body of knowledge about
   climate change risks, and changes to passenger transportation are often
   at the center of these efforts. Yet little information exists for
   characterizing how quickly or slowly GHG emissions reductions will
   accrue given changes in urban form around transit and whether benefits
   will accrue quickly enough to meet policy year targets (such as reaching
   20\% of 1990 GHG emissions levels by 2050). Achieving GHG reductions
   through integrated transportation and land use planning is even more
   complicated for cities because changes in emissions can occur across
   many sectors (such as transportation, building energy use, and
   electricity generation). With the use of the Los Angeles, California,
   Expo Line, a framework was developed to assess how financing schemes
   could affect the rate of building redevelopment and resulting life-cycle
   GHG emissions from travel and building energy use. The framework
   leveraged an integrated transportation and land use life-cycle
   assessment model that captured upfront construction of new development
   near transit and the long-term changes in household energy use for
   travel and buildings. The results show that for the same amount of
   development around the Expo Line, it is possible either to meet state
   GHG goals by 2050 (if aggressive redevelopment happens early) or not
   meet those goals by 2050 (if significant redevelopment does not start
   for decades). The time-based approach reveals how redevelopment
   schedules should be considered when strategies for meeting future GHG
   emissions targets are set.},

Title = {BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING: PROCUREMENT PROCEDURE},
Journal = {BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {180-197},
Abstract = {Traditional construction planning is being replaced by the building
   information modelling (BIM) approach, which seeks to digitalise all the
   construction procedures, including procurement. Successful
   implementation of BIM on the market requires the preparation of
   appropriate procurement documents.
   Purpose - to suggest the most suitable set of documents for public
   procurement in the context of BIM by analysing the documents that are
   necessary for implementing the stages of the building life cycle.
   Research methodology - in order to achieve the aim of the research, the
   in-depth analysis of different countries' procurement methodological
   documents and analysis of the scientific articles have been implemented.
   The methodology also includes expert interviewing, which was done in
   order to analyse the investigated standards.
   Findings - After analysing the procurement procedures of Norway, Spain,
   France, Poland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, a set
   of documents, including Employer's Information Requirements (EIR), BIM
   Execution Plan (BEP) and BIM protocol, was considered as the most
   suitable for BIM-based procurement processes. In addition, the basic
   principles of ISO 19650-2:2018 do not reflect the specific conditions of
   each country, so it is appropriate to examine the possibility of
   providing guidance in individual national annexes that reflects the
   peculiarities of national procurement.
   Research limitations - some research limitations were related to the
   challenges to access the literature, particularly the regulatory
   documentation associated with the public procurement procedure in a
   singular Country. Also, the difficulties with and accessing the document
   in the English language. However, in most of these cases, the document
   overview was analysed or translated from the native language.
   Originality/Value - existing related studies are mainly oriented on a
   particular region/country, and no general overview of European countries
   regarding BIM procurement procedures has been implemented. Additionally,
   a significant scientific contribution of this research is the review of
   the fundamental standards, which includes the general specification for
   information management in construction projects using BIM. Implemented
   analysis can serve as a basis for other authors to implement their
   research concerning their region, to suggest the most appropriate and
   suitable set of documents.
   Practical implications - this study contributes to the preparation of
   the Lithuanian market for the implementation of BIM and could help
   policy-makers to prepare the most appropriate procurement documents.},

Abstract = {The digital twins (DT) has quickly become a hot topic since it was
   proposed. It appears in all kinds of commercial propaganda and is widely
   quoted by academic circles. However, the term DT has misstatements and
   is misused in business and academics. This study revisits DT and defines
   it to be a more advanced system/product/service modeling and simulation
   environment that combines most modern information communication
   technologies (ICTs) and engineering mechanism digitization and
   characterized by system/product/service life cycle management,
   physically geometric visualization, real-time sensing and measurement of
   system operating conditions, predictability of system
   performance/safety/lifespan, and complete engineering mechanisms-based
   simulations. The idea of DT originates from modeling and simulation
   practices of engineering informatization, including virtual
   manufacturing (VM), model predictive control, and building information
   modeling (BIM). On the basis of the two-element VM model, we propose a
   three-element model to represent DT. DT does not have its unique
   technical characteristics. The existing practices of DT are extensions
   of the engineering informatization embracing modern ICTs. These insights
   clarify the origin of DT and its technical essentials.},

Abstract = {Coordination among different project disciplines is a critical stage in
   a prefabricated projects and it has obvious influence in the total cost

   unit is the component which is also regarded as the basic element of
   BIM. Taking advantage of BIM in building life-cycle management and
   coalescing the idea of omniclass and model view definition, this
   research suggests an approach to improve information integrated
   management, including information classification and information
   delivery, in prefabrication using ontological technologies. The
   development process contains three stages: 1) work scope definition,
   which is to set a research topic and limit work boundary; 2) knowledge
   flow map creation, which is to describe important work processes and
   data or knowledge exchange among the involved stakeholders; and 3)
   ontology development, which is to generate data sharing ontology and
   domain ontology generation, and define alignment rules and constraint
   rules based on the knowledge flow map. Through the proposed
   ontology-based approach, the stakeholders are able to create information
   which represents their views of the projects and make appropriate use of
   the knowledge iteration in the prefabricated projects. Finally, a case
   study on cost estimation and optimization in prefabricated project is
   undertaken for validation of this method.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Volume = {194},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Due to global climate change, carbon reduction has become a critical
   issue for the construction industry. Low carbon building has been
   adopted as a strategic objective, and its implementation demonstrates
   the enormous potential of reducing carbon emissions. Despite much
   research, some important research areas or gaps have not been
   identified, while simultaneously, few studies describe the knowledge
   roadmap for low carbon building research necessary to guide scholars and
   practitioners. The purpose in this paper is to provide a comprehensive
   and objective analysis of research areas regarding low carbon building
   using the scientometrics method. A total of 378 low carbon
   building-related publications were reviewed. Based on the keyword
   co-word analysis, document co-citation analysis and clustering analysis,
   the results show that 100 research keywords, 3 research hotspots and 5
   research domains are extremely important for the advancement of low
   carbon building. Based on the in-depth analysis of the findings, the
   knowledge structure with different prominences was developed, which
   grouped LCB research into five themes and various sub-topics.
   Significantly, this paper provides the knowledge roadmap needed to
   facilitate further research and applications for both academia and
   industry stakeholders to improve low carbon building. (C) 2019 Published

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a collaborative system used
   extensively in the design and management of the Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries. Current platforms manage
   the information as data centres (i.e. databases) related to graphical
   representations located in 3D parametric models. Today, these new
   technologies are nowadays being incorporated in heritage assets. This
   paper aims to establish a methodology, based on these efficient
   platforms, for studying built heritage, including historical and
   construction aspects by adding the chronology of those interventions
   made in the historic building. This case study is focused on the Palace
   of the Children of Don Gome, a historic building located in the city of
   Andujar, in Jaen (Spain). The interest of this case study lies in the
   historic innovations and areas added to this palace. Likewise, the
   collection and manipulation of the graphic information and data related
   to the interventions have been based on an interoperable 3D graphic
   model, which allows users to include all the related documentation from
   different disciplines associated with the conservation and heritage
   restoration processes. In this paper, the construction process carried
   out during the last restoration of the building is studied.
   Specifically, it analyses the last building intervention in 1989, in
   particular an area of the coffered ceiling slab in the northern nave,
   located on the first floor. Within this model, all the elements that
   constitute the roof of the tower, mudwall walls, slabs and coffered
   ceilings of the northern nave have been studied, using photogrammetry
   for data acquisition and 3D modelling, and these data are included in a
   3D digital model of the building generated using ArchiCAD software.
   Moreover, the system will be used to improve the management of the
   information obtained during heritage maintenance, creating a record of
   the whole building life cycle. As well as the historical documentation
   and graphical research, and the analysis of the procedures carried out
   during the last refurbishment of the building, new building construction
   system proposals have arisen which have been modelled to fulfil the
   Level Of Development (LOD) 300. Further analysis of these construction
   solutions used provides knowledge of how large 16th century palaces were
   built, and the kind of restoration conducted by architects at the end of
   the 20th century. The results obtained show how current BIM platforms
   are able to record construction and evolutionary aspects of a building's
   history, by identifying all the original elements and classifying them
   before their demolition. Also, by making a detailed inventory of the
   whole coffered ceiling in which the position and the temporal order
   (original - later addition) of the elements are included, it is possible
   to virtually replace those elements in their original positions,
   reducing the visual impact of the intervention. On the other hand,
   multiple errors in projects based on graphical systems of
   representation, mainly Computer-Aided Design (CAD), may derive from
   contradictions in the official sources consulted, such as the plans of
   the cadastre, the city council, and those produced through manual
   measurement procedures. However, in this paper, real graphical
   documentation has been generated using specific 3D surveying techniques
   for capturing geometry and accurate measurements, as well as by
   utilising the BIM system.},

Abstract = {Building sector is a major contributor to the emissions of pollutant
   gases, which are responsible for health-damaging effects of climate
   change. To quantify and reduce these emissions. This comparative study
   is presented between two buildings that could have a sanitary or any
   other type of use. Both buildings have similar characteristics, except
   for their structures, one made of metal and the other of concrete. The
   design, structural calculation and three-dimensional dimensioning were
   performed using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The budget and the
   product carbon footprint study were also carried out, to calculate the
   level of emissions of each building. The study determined higher
   emissions for the metal-structured building, with 621.234 tCO2/tmaterial
   compared to 446.707 tCO2/tmaterial for the concrete building. To reduce
   these emissions, measures related to the replacement of the previously
   selected materials, by other materials with lower emission rates and
   identical functionality were pre-sented, such as the replacement of
   metal building roof polyurethane, or the composition of cement for the
   concrete building. Both actions represented a reduction of 84.61\% CO2
   emissions for metal envelope building and 31.765\% for the concrete
   structure. The results of this work will help to select more sustainable
   materials to use in the renovation of existing buildings, or in the
   construction of new buildings. For example, health-related buildings,
   currently in high demand, given the current pandemic situation caused by
   COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Physical assets are, nowadays, more and more induded in the digital
   environment, providing huge amount of data, and involving a complex
   network of stakeholders. Many Information Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) are employed in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
   Operation (AECO), in order to tackle the digital transformation.
   Currently, one of the most acknovvl edged approaches for managing the
   new complexity of the built environment is Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). This article addresses the issue of the maturity of
   organisations, which adopt or are willing to adopt a BIM approach.
   Therefore, research aims at providing a critical review on BIM maturity
   of organisations operating in AECO. The BIM approach can be considered a
   step forward for supporting the development of digital processes able to
   foster the achievement of their business objectives. The scope of the
   research concerns the overall dynamics of the AECO sector concerning the
   digital revolution affecting management of the built environment
   processes along the life cycle of physical assets. Therefore, a
   literature review on Scopus databases has been carried out and most
   relevant dynamics in the literature production have been identified and
   investigated trough bibliometric, trend and cluster analyses carried out
   on the selected sample of articles. In summary it can be stated that the
   BIM maturity allow to evaluate organisations' digitalisation potential
   enabling the reengineering of business processes. Moreover, the
   evaluation of organisations' BIM compliant approaches can provide a
   sound assessment method during a bid process, contributing to the
   transparent and effective selection of the most virtuous firms.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Working with heritage is complex and projects often include scientific,
   structural, and documentary studies. Every step requires a systematic
   approach in which the contribution of the diverse experts that
   participate in the conservation of heritage assets is analysed following
   the logical sequence of the project execution phase. However, there are
   still no scientific contributions that record the complete process. A
   logical sequence, called a `systematic approach' in this paper, should
   start with data acquisition using remote sensing techniques, the
   insertion of point cloud data in a Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   environment, ontologies applied to HBIM (Historic BIM), data
   classification, and evolution towards the Digital Twin (DT) concept.
   This paper also analyses the modelling workflow of a case study, the
   construction of a column base of the Santiago church in Jerez de la
   Frontera (Spain). This component has been automatically modelled from a
   mesh in an Autodesk Revit family and through an adaptive mesh process in
   ArchiCAD. Furthermore, one of the objectives was the data organisation
   by following and extending a standard data structure of the column
   components. This paper presents a novel holistic approach from data
   capture, analysis of complex geometry, construction of the semantically
   enriched parametric model, and exchange of it among all involved
   professionals in open source IFC formats. This systematic approach
   therefore makes it possible to obtain a validated DT for the life-cycle
   management of architectural elements.},

Abstract = {The burden of the European construction and building sector on the
   natural environment is apparent from the data, which reveal the energy,
   materials, and water consumption, and the waste generation associated
   with the building sector. Yet, significant efforts in improving the
   environmental awareness and sustainability of the construction sector
   are arising through the introduction of the numerous regulations,
   directives, and initiatives. This review work provides an overview of
   the most relevant existing European policies and legislation for the
   built environment, and the construction materials in particular. The
   implementation of a comparative assessment against the key elements of
   the international legislation and efforts enables the definition of the
   responsiveness of the EU in enacting policies that ensure the
   environmental sustainability of the sector, as well as identifies
   prospects for further improvement. Working towards the increase of the
   sustainability of the construction sector in a framework of holistic
   life cycle considerations is promoted in the current legislation, where
   identifying opportunities for energy and cost savings, utilizing natural
   resources efficiently and achieving waste minimization is endorsed. This
   work can be exploited from both policy- makers and the scientific
   community as guidance for transforming in a truly green sustainable
   construction market. The conclusions of this work indicate that the
   sustainability of the built environment will come through the increased
   use of alternative, recycled, natural and unconventional construction
   materials and thermal insulation materials, the exploitation of
   prefabricated building elements, the integration of LCA with BIM, the
   employment of multi- objective optimization methodologies, and the
   development of country- specific data for the implementation of Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. These fields, as well as other factors
   such as globilisation and government intervention, are critical for
   fulfilling the vision of the European Union (EU) and will require
   systematic approach for their incorporation in the relevant policies to
   be developed and introduced in the near future.},

Abstract = {This article presents two types of data analysis, that can be used for
   processing building management data. Classical and intellectual.
   Classical analysis presents hard preset algorithmic data analysis, that
   can be more useful if structure of data is homogeneous and cannot be
   changed. Intellectual data analysis can be used if we have extremely
   large unstructured data sets. Data mining is becoming more and more
   relevant in modern world. Also, this paper presents an example of
   possible simple data storage in relational database Oracle and getting
   values from low-level devices method. The information obtained as a
   result of the data analysis(mostly intellectual) can be used for
   predicting future deviations and developing warning correcting
   algorithms, optimization and synchronization of building systems,
   development, research, construction of models, testing and pilot
   operation of the best scenarios of interaction between the building's
   engineering systems and the impact of these scenarios on the life cycle
   of the building.},

   Building Information Modeling (BIM) projects where coordinators and
   managers are willing to analyze behavioral patterns and efficiency of
   their modelers and to identify further training needs and opportunities
   to increase their performance.
   Abstract Collaborative work in Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   projects is frequently understood as the interaction of modelers in an
   asynchronous way through modification requests or via e-mail/telephone.
   However, alternative work methodologies based on creating a common and
   synchronous environment allow solving issues instantaneously during the
   design process. This study aimed to analyze the behavior and performance
   of BIM users with different specialties who were subjected to an
   experimental exercise in a collaborative environment. For this purpose,
   a process was devised to collect, sort, and select the data from the log
   files generated by the BIM software. A timeline of the experiment was
   populated with data on the intensity and types of commands used by each
   specialist, which allowed determining behavioral patterns, preferred
   commands, indicators of their experience, further training needs, and
   possible strategies for improving the team's performance. In the
   experiment, the mechanical designer's performance was 49\% and the rest
   approximately 64\%, with respect to that of the architect. An average
   rate of 1.66 necessary or auxiliary commands for each contributory
   command was detected. The average performance was 200-400 commands per
   hour, which intensified by the end of the experiment. Further training
   needs were detected for the plumbing designer to reduce the use of
   backwards commands. Conversely, the electrical designer showed a
   positive evolution regarding this aspect during the experiment. The
   analysis methods here described become useful for the aforementioned
   purposes. Nevertheless, combinations with methods from existing research
   might improve the outcomes and therefore the specificity of
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {Discussions on Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) have relied
   largely on partial or general equilibrium models. Such models are useful
   for integrating market effects into CLCA, but also have well-recognized
   limitations such as the poor granularity of the sectoral definition and
   the assumption of perfect oversight by all economic agents. Building on
   the Rectangular-Choice-of Technology (RCOT) model, this study proposes a
   new modeling approach for CLCA, the Technology Choice Model (TCM). In
   this approach, the RCOT model is adapted for its use in CLCA and
   extended to incorporate parameter uncertainties and suboptimal decisions
   due to market imperfections and information asymmetry in a stochastic
   setting. In a case study on rice production, we demonstrate that the
   proposed approach allows modeling of complex production technology mixes
   and their expected environmental outcomes under uncertainty, at a high
   level of detail. Incorporating the effect of production constraints,
   uncertainty, and suboptimal decisions by economic agents significantly
   affects technology mixes and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   of the system under study. The case study also shows the model's ability
   to determine both the average and marginal environmental impacts of a
   product in response to changes in the quantity of final demand.},

Abstract = {Safety is a major concern in the construction industry. Recent studies
   have shown that many construction fatalities are related to design and
   could have been avoided with proper design considerations. Nevertheless,
   designers have limited knowledge about construction safety and often are
   unable to identify how their designs may pose a risk during the life
   cycle of a building facility such as construction, operation and
   maintenance. Limited effort has been made to help designer to address
   these safety issues in the design phase. This study presents a
   structured DfS rule-based knowledge library to provide safety knowledge
   to designer. Using the DfS knowledge library, an Intelligent
   BIM-integrated risk review system is proposed to help designers identify
   risk related to their design element along with required design
   features. A risk register system is also developed in the BIM platform
   to follow up for any residual risk. The proposed risk review system has
   been examined with an illustrative case project. It is found that many
   of the risks could have been avoided/eliminated with the DfS knowledge
   library and intelligent risk review system early in the design phase.
   Thus, it would help to avoid any unexpected delay or costly design
   change late in the project to mitigate the risk.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is well established in Denmark.
   However, there has been a lack of focus on the value that can be
   generated by using BIM during the design and construction phase. In this
   paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept
   look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work
   method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction
   processes? A literature review established the main areas to further
   address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project
   and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation
   of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic
   design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a
   digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases
   and into the construction and O\&M phases with the use of structured
   data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In
   order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital
   construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further
   developed. The work also discovers and investigates how an academic
   institution can develop work methods through on-going development, tests
   and evaluation in collaboration with practitioners from the AEC
   industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, society has increasingly moved towards the
   adoption of digital solutions in almost every aspect of people's lives
   with the aim of enhancing daily activities. At the same time, the
   environmental impact of the built environment has attracted the
   attention of public opinion that is gradually perceiving the necessity
   of limiting its negative effects in order to safeguard the Earth and
   people's wellbeing. The Internet of Things is one of the biggest
   ecosystems that is bringing innovations encompassing digital solutions
   in almost every sector. On the other hand, the Building Information
   Modeling approach allows for data sharing among stakeholders,
   traceability, and the integrated management of the building or
   infrastructure life-cycle through a 3D informative virtual model. Our
   study reviews existing research works and technological solutions that
   integrate these two important topics to enhance the sustainability of
   the built environment, making it smarter. The presented review analyses
   the existing papers available in literature from January 2015 to
   December 2020, to present the best practices in this integration and
   discuss limitations of the identified solutions. Based on the outcomes
   of the analysis and aiming at the creation of a solid knowledge basis
   for the community interested in the sector, a comprehensive modular
   architecture has been proposed. Finally, new directions for future works
   are presented by discussing how the proposed architecture can actually

Abstract = {The Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has
   implemented vertical Building Information modeling (BIM) to increase the
   productivity and overcome the backwardness compared to other industries.
   The benefits of BIM deployment as a process in the AEC industry have
   caused the Non-Building (NB) industry to shift toward use of this
   concept. While the positive role of BIM implementation in the AEC
   industry has been proven and its levels go up increasingly, Civil
   Information Modeling (CIM) intends to apply the concept of BIM for the
   NB industry. As current research showed the lack of CIM deployment in
   NB, especially in the Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Construction (OGPC)
   industry, this research focuses on the transformation of CIM in the OGPC
   industry as part of the NB industry. Due to particular circumstances
   such as oil price fluctuations, complex and specialized nature, very
   strict climate and environmental regulations, project life-cycle costs
   and the increasing need to comply with sustainable development goals, it
   is required to enrich the OGPC industry by an effective concept like BIM
   to prevent its projects from moving towards uneconomical phases. This
   study is an action research that is organized in three parts through
   mixed methods approach including extensive literature review,
   semi-structured interview and focus group. This research is the second
   part of an ongoing CIM adoption study. It reveals the CIM uses for
   enriching the OGPC industry and introduces a simple CIM transformation
   framework for the OGPC industry firms. The challenges, limitations,
   gaps, and requirements for the faster transformation of CIM in the OGPC
   industry are highlighted and future needed studies are addressed.},

Title = {DATA TRANSFER BETWEEN DIGITAL MODELS OF BUILT ASSETS AND THEIR OPERATION
   \& MAINTENANCE SYSTEMS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {469-481},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance of built assets is crucial for optimising
   their whole life cost and efficiency. Historically, however, there has
   been a general failure in the transfer information between the
   designand-construct (D\&C) and operate-and-maintain (O\&M) phases of the
   asset lifecycle. The recent steady uptake of digital technologies, such
   as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the D\&C phase has been
   accompanied by an expectation that this would enable better transfer of
   information to those responsible for O\&M. Progress has been slow, with
   practitioners being unsure as to how to incorporate BIM into their
   working practices. Three types of challenge are identified, related to
   communication, experience and technology. In examining the last aspect,
   it appears that a major problem has been that of interoperability
   between building information models and the many computer-aided
   facilities management (CAFM) systems in use. The successful and
   automatic transfer of information from a building model to an FM tool
   is, in theory, achievable through the medium of the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) schema. However, this relies upon the authoring of the
   model in terms of how well its structure permits the identification of
   relevant objects, their relationships and attributes. The testing of
   over 100 anonymised building models revealed that very few did;
   prohibiting their straightforward mapping to the maintenance database we
   had selected for the test. An alternative, hybrid approach was developed
   using an opensource software toolkit to identify objects by their
   geometry as well as their classification, thus enabling their automatic
   transfer. In some cases, manual transfer proved necessary. The
   implications are that while these problems can be overcome on a
   case-by-case basis, interoperability between D\&C and O\&M systems will
   not become standard until it is accommodated by appropriate and informed
   authoring of building models.},

   Management},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are
   introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control
   towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect
   complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process
   optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle
   management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the
   real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of
   Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with
   proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building
   asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability,
   interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM
   to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were
   performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability,
   interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides
   decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation
   of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of
   CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as
   integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.},

Title = {An integrated optimization and sensitivity analysis approach to support
   the life cycle energy trade-off in building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The building design process plays a central role in efforts to implement
   energy-efficient practices. However, unilateral design choices based
   solely on reducing operational energy use can significantly increase a
   building's embodied energy and life cycle energy use as there is a
   trade-off between embodied and operational energy. To support such
   trade-off problems, multi-objective optimization represents a useful
   approach that produces a set of optimal solutions from where a solution
   can then be selected and progressed within the design process. Selecting
   one solution from the set of optimal solutions can however be a
   challenging task as each solution has the potential to be chosen as the
   optimum. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore how
   solutions from a multi-objective optimization approach can be analyzed
   further to provide information to decision-makers when selecting the
   optimal design solution. An approach is proposed where the integration
   of post-optimization sensitivity analysis into a multi-objective
   optimization approach aims to support decision-makers in analyzing the
   optimal solutions provided by the optimization process. The
   applicability of approach is demonstrated using a case of a multifamily
   apartment building located in Sweden, where the aforementioned trade-off
   is explored for a set of energy efficiency measures. Thereby, a diverse
   range of optimal solutions that could result in up to 4520 GJ life cycle
   energy (LCE) savings relative to the case building's initial design was
   ini-tially identified using the multi-objective optimization. These
   solutions were then subjected to a sensi-tivity analysis where the
   results indicated that in general the lowest and highest sensitivity in
   terms of LCE use belonged to the insulation thicknesses in roof and
   walls, respectively. Furthermore, the thick-ness of exterior floor
   insulation yielded the greatest variation in the sensitivity. The
   findings of case study indicate that the post-optimization sensitivity
   analysis can add valuable information that complements the results
   obtained using a multi-objective optimization approach. Consequently, it
   can support decision-making on how to progress with the design in terms
   of what design parameters have a negligi-ble or significant impact on
   the objectives when they are varied, thus facilitating prioritization.

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {174988-175008},
Abstract = {As a major challenge and opportunity for traditional manufacturing,
   intelligent manufacturing is facing the needs of sustainable development
   in future. Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role
   for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the
   paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of
   sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole
   life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The
   sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes
   indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator
   importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project
   assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert
   judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal
   fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the
   complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is
   processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE
   II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage
   evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for
   intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented
   digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability
   assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability
   assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air
   conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were
   validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough
   extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator
   importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value
   determining method by accurate expert scoring.},

Title = {Utilizing intelligent technologies in construction and demolition waste
   management: From a systematic review to an implementation framework},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 21},
Abstract = {The rapid increase in global urbanization, along with the growth of the
   construction industry, highlights the urgent need for effective
   management of construction and demolition (C\&D) waste. Intelligent
   technologies offer a viable solution to this critical challenge.
   However, there remains a significant challenge in integrating these
   technologies into a cohesive framework. This study conducts a
   quantitative analysis of 214 papers from 2000 to 2023, highlighting the
   extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and building information
   modeling (BIM), along with geographic information systems (GIS) and big
   data (BD). A further qualitative analysis of 73 selected papers
   investigates the use of seven different intelligent technologies in the
   context of C\&D waste management (CDWM). To overcome current limitations
   in knowledge, future research should concentrate on (1) the
   comprehensive integration of technology, (2) inclusive studies
   throughout all lifecycle phases of CDWM, and (3) the continued
   examination of new technologies, such as blockchain. Based on these
   insights, this study suggests a strategic framework for the effective
   implementation of intelligent technologies in CDWM. This framework aims
   to assist professionals in merging various technologies, undertaking
   lifecycle-wide research, and narrowing the divide between existing and
   new technologies. It also lays a solid foundation for future academic
   work to examine specific intelligent technologies, conduct comparative
   studies, and refine strategic decisions. Regular updates on
   technological developments are essential for stakeholders to
   consistently enhance CDWM standards.},

Title = {BIM-based semantic building world modeling for robot task planning and
   execution in built environments},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From its internal representation of a building, or, its building world,
   a robot can retrieve a building's information for task planning and
   execution. However, a building is a complex construct composed of
   thousands of sub elements, therefore manually programming the complete
   lifecycle information in a robot can be impractical. Our study presents
   the creation of a semantic building world from a building information
   model (BIM) that can be used for robot operations. To describe static
   and dynamic elements, we create a Universal Robot Description Format
   (URDF) building world using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) that a
   robot can directly query information for task planning and execution. As
   the case study demonstrates, our study bridges the gap between BIM's
   lifecycle information and robot operations. By allowing robots to
   acquire information about operating environments, the proposed
   methodologies provide the foundation for studies attempting task
   robotization in different types of facilities throughout their
   lifecycles.},

Abstract = {Identification of alternative, sustainable materials, and technologies
   in traditional masonry work could decrease economic, environmental, and
   social impacts, such as energy usage and cost during the life-cycle of
   the building. In the present study, sustainable brick was developed
   using locally available industrial by-product (co-fired blended
   ash-CBA). Physico-mechanical, durability, and thermal conductivity tests
   were conducted on CBA bricks that fulfilled the requirements of Indian
   standard. Properties of the developed product were compared with the
   commercially available fly ash (FA) bricks. CBA bricks were found to be
   26\% lighter in weight with respect to FA bricks, which further caused
   the reduction in the dead load. In comparison with the FA bricks,
   embodied energy and thermal conductivity of the developed bricks was
   reduced by 23\% and 49.5\% respectively. The decreased thermal
   conductivity was helpful in reducing the operational energy demand of a
   building. The concept was briefed with a case study of a building over
   Nagpur (Maharashtra, India) that comes under the composite climatic zone
   as per SP 7: 2005. Building plan approved by the Indian standards and
   local government practice for single storey structure was modelled and
   analyzed in the simulation software (building information modelling
   tool) for the considered geographic location. With respect to FA bricks,
   CBA bricks reduced the peak-cooling load of a building by 8.3\%.
   Developed sustainable bricks were helpful in reducing the energy demand
   of the building in a cost effective manner. The study suggested that the
   application of novel sustainable building material with a computational
   approach strengthens the decision process.},

Title = {Development of a multi-objective optimization model for determining the

Abstract = {Measures to improve the building energy efficiency of deteriorated
   multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs) require trade-offs between
   economic and environmental feasibility, and therefore these aspects
   should be considered simultaneously. Towards this end, this study aimed
   to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining the
   optimal CO2 emission reduction (CER) strategies for MFHCs that can be
   used not only by experts but also by non-experts. This study used
   integrated multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm as an
   optimization methodology. The developed model, which considers the five
   optimization objectives (i.e., initial investment cost, net present
   value, savings-to-investment cost, CER, and marginal abatement cost) at
   the same time, can review a total of 31,200 scenarios combined with four
   energy saving measures (i.e., insulation, window, lighting, and shading
   systems). To verify the feasibility of the developed model, this study
   conducted a case study targeting `D' MFHC in South Korea. First, the
   accuracy of the calibration of the energy simulation model for `D' MFHC
   (coefficient of variation of the root mean square error: 12.84\%; mean
   bias error: 0.39\%) satisfied the criteria of ASHRAE Guideline 14;
   second, I8 (expanded polystyrene board - type 1 (No. 4))-L3 (LED
   lighting installed in louvered ceiling) and I8 (expanded polystyrene
   board - type 1 (No. 4)) - L4 (ceiling-mounted light) were determined to
   be the optimal CER strategy (integrated multi-objective optimization
   score: 0.2252). The developed model can help building owners make the
   optimal decision on green modeling by entering simple information (e.g.,
   region, total floor area, etc.).},

Abstract = {The exploitation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) for tracking
   and archiving the properties of structural construction components could
   be a potentially innovative disruption for the construction sector. This
   is because RFID can stimulate the reuse of construction components and
   reduce their wastage, hence addressing sustainability issues in the
   construction sector. To test the plausibility of that idea, this study
   explores the potential pre-conditions for RFID to facilitate
   construction components reuse, and develops a guidance for promoting
   their redistribution back to the supply chain. It also looks at how
   integrating RFID with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can possibly
   be a valuable extension of its capabilities, providing the opportunity
   for tracked components to be incorporated into new structures in an
   informed, sound way. A preliminary assessment of the strengths,
   weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the RFID technology is
   presented in order to depict its current and future potential in
   promoting construction components' sustainable lifecycle management,
   while emphasis has been laid on capturing their technical,
   environmental, economic and social value. Findings suggest that the
   collection of the right amount of information at the
   design-construction-deconstruction-reuse-disposal stage is crucial for
   RFID to become a successful innovation in the construction sector.
   Although a number of limitations related to the technical operability
   and recycling of RFID tags seem to currently hinder its uptake for
   structural components' lifecycle management, future technological
   innovations could provide solutions that would enable it to become a
   mainstream practice. Taken together these proposals advocate that the
   use of RFID and its integration with BIM can create the right
   environment for the development of new business models focused on
   sustainable resource management. These models may then unlock multiple
   values that are otherwise dissipated in the system. If the rapid
   technological development of RFID capability can be allied to policy
   interventions that control and manage its uptake along the supply chain,
   the sustainable lifecycle management of construction components could be
   radically enhanced. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {A novel blockchain-based system for improving information integrity in
   building projects from the perspective of building energy performance},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global population growth has long been intertwined with environmental
   concerns and sustainable development. The building sector, a significant
   energy consumer worldwide, contributes substantially to total energy
   consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. With the projected global
   population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, building energy
   consumption is expected to rise continuously, emphasizing the need to
   optimize energy performance for environmental sustainability. Despite
   efforts by many countries to formulate energy conservation objectives
   and strategies, empirical evidence reveals a substantial disparity
   between designed and actual building energy consumption, known as the
   building energy performance gap (BEPG). This gap poses a significant
   challenge to energy conservation efforts, and the lack of information
   integrity is a significant contributor to this gap. To address the
   challenge of inadequate information integrity in building energy
   projects, this research proposes an innovative solution based on
   blockchain technology. By utilizing blockchain's decentralized,
   transparent, and tamper-resistant nature, the proposed model aims to
   enhance information transmission mechanisms among stakeholders. Ten key
   energy-related stakeholders and various information flows within
   building projects are identified. Based on this, an exploratory
   architectural information management model incorporating blockchain
   technology is developed. The model features functionalities such as data
   recording, retrieval, transmission, and incentive mechanisms to ensure
   data immutability and reliable access security. Through a case study,
   the model's performance is evaluated in terms of storage cost, latency,
   and privacy, demonstrating significant time savings in uploading and
   transferring files. The proposed blockchain-based model offers a
   feasible solution to the challenges of inadequate information integrity
   in building energy projects, promoting collaboration and accurate
   information transmission. This model contributes to improving project
   outcomes and advancing sustainable development in the construction
   industry.},

Abstract = {Product and process models provide the necessary information framework
   for implementing computer systems for the
   architect/engineering/construction (A/E/C) industry. Although the focus
   of these models is slightly different, both are needed to provide a
   foundation for managing project information during the design and
   construction phases. Design information-''product'' information based on
   building components-needs to be integrated with construction management
   tasks, the `'process'' information necessary to build the components. It
   is therefore important to provide an integrated information model to
   bridge the gap between product and process information for a
   construction project, An integrated information model not only
   encourages those involved in construction to use and add to design
   information, but also provides richer information representation, better
   efficiency and data consistency, and the flexibility to support
   life-cycle information management. The research presented in this paper
   was performed under the auspices of the collaborative engineering
   research program at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Construction
   Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL), which is attempting to
   redefine existing design processes to make them more collaborative and
   to develop enabling technologies to support the new process. An
   important part of this research is the development of an integrated
   information model that allows agents to communicate/collaborate over the
   life cycle of the project. This paper presents an object-oriented model
   that integrates product and process information to support collaboration
   among design and construction agents, and two prototype construction
   agents for construction planning and monitoring project progress. The
   development of these two agents demonstrates the value of using
   integrated product and process models for managing facility information
   in the A/E/C industry.},

Abstract = {Rethinking the existing buildings is a non-deferrable imperative for the
   very life of the contemporary city. The implementation of
   well-established techniques in the architectural project, such as
   intelligent and ``informing{''} BIM modelling, the Life cycle analysis,
   the energy and waste management for the purpose of savings and of
   efficiency, can be applied in cases of reuse and transformation of the
   built heritage.
   The paper illustrates, through the presentation of a project carried out
   on a former hospital pavilion, the path followed. From the survey and
   the historical-critical analysis, through the study of the vocation of
   the building, up to the planning, to end with the yard. The
   interventions aimed at reducing energy consumption begin with the
   evaluation of materials, that are preserved as much as possible, to
   focus on the thermal and acoustic insulation of windows, roof, walls and
   floors, to the search for an appropriate energy source, in this case the
   geothermal. The result is that a historical organism, bound by the
   Superintendent, comes back to life with function of hospitality, in a
   carbon neutral intended production cycle.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to describe the development and testing of an
   employer's information requirements (EIR) template and guidance document
   designed to meet client and facility management (FM) needs in the
   building information modelling (BIM) process.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative design approach was used and
   triangulation of methods which included a focus group with the British
   Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM), semi-structured interviews
   with the case study Glasgow Life Burrell Renaissance Project who
   trialled the EIR and peer-reviews and interviews with BIM/CAFM experts
   from the BIM Academy and FM180.
   Findings - Specific guidance to help clients and facility managers
   prepare key BIM documents like the EIR are needed. They are aware of
   industry BIM standards and guidance but often not in detail. The Glasgow
   Life case study illustrated the EIR as a useful collaboration-tool to
   bring together stakeholders in early planning stages to understand
   client information needs.
   Social implications - Assets and buildings account for most of the
   energy and material use in society. A well-structured EIR will help
   ensure the right information is available to enable optimisation of
   running costs and utility-use over their whole life, thus contributing
   to long-term sustainability.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a new EIR template and guidance
   document ideal for practitioners in industry as a practical starting
   point to plan the client information requirements for BIM projects. It
   can be downloaded at www.bifm.org.uk/bifm/knowledge.},

Abstract = {Laser scanning for rapid spatial data acquisition is an established
   technology in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   sector with a wide range of applications. An understanding of the wide
   variation of technical requirements and considerations associated with
   these applications is critical to decision making about laser-scanning
   implementation on projects. Furthermore, significant industry
   transformations in the use of building information modeling present
   extraordinary opportunities for AEC professionals to employ the use of
   laser scanning in the context of holistic, collaborative workflows
   grounded in three-dimensional model-based design. This report analyzes
   the construction engineering requirements of laser scanning technology
   for applications across all phases of the project life cycle and
   proposes a multidisciplinary framework to integrate applications of
   laser scanning technology with the fundamentals of three-dimensional

Volume = {40},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The construction industry is faced with numerous challenges including
   low productivity, lack of research and development, and poor technology
   advancements. Advances in digital technologies such as digital twin (DT)
   has seen enormous utilisations in digitally advanced industries
   including the manufacturing and automotive industries. It presents an
   opportunity for the integration of the physical world to the digital
   world. DT technology has the potential to transform the construction
   industry and provide responses to some of its challenges. As a result,
   the concept of DT has attracted much attention and is developing at a
   rapid pace. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current
   state of DT applications in the construction industry. This study
   comprehensively reviews and analyses DT concept, technologies, and
   application in the construction industry using a systematic review
   methodology while incorporating the science mapping method. After a
   complete search of several databases and careful selection in line with
   the proposed criteria, 22 academic publications about DT application in
   the construction industry were identified and classified accordingly.
   The research analysed in detail the status, evolution of the concept,
   key technologies, and six areas of application in the lifecycle phases
   of a project: building information modeling, structural system
   integrity, facilities management, monitoring, logistics processes, and
   energy simulation. This research shows that there is a high potential
   for DT to enable solutions to the numerous challenges in the
   construction industry. Thus, this study raises the level of awareness
   and need for the application of DT in the construction industry.},

Title = {Conceptual Framework and Roadmap Approach for Integrating BIM into
   Lifecycle Project Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As a disruptive information and communication technology (ICT) in the
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry,
   building information modeling (BIM) enables project teams to manage a
   project via a model-based cooperative approach. Although it has a
   widespread impact on the industry, the systematic implementation of BIM
   in projects faces challenges. This study integrated BIM into the
   lifecycle of a building project with the introduction of a conceptual
   framework constituted by BIM Information Flow, BIM Model Chain, BIM
   Workflow, BIM Institutional Environment, and BIM-based Project
   Management Information System (PMIS). This conceptual framework
   identifies the key areas for integrating BIM into the project lifecycle
   and explains how BIM works for project management practice. Through an
   ethnographic action research approach, the study developed a BIM roadmap
   for the project lifecycle by systematically implementing BIM in the
   building project. The major findings and pieces of evidence derived via
   the implementation support the conceptual framework. The following
   discussions explain how BIM disrupts the project from the view of
   organization design and clarify the contributions of this study in
   project management, as well as BIM adoption and integration. Finally,
   the conclusions focus on the development of this research, the role of
   the conceptual framework to underlie the BIM roadmap, and the research
   limitations. Recommendations are provided toward future research works.},

Title = {Digitalization for sustainable buildings: Technologies, applications,
   potential, and challenges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {450},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In the fight against climate change, and to improve its sustainability
   standards, the building sector is trying to reduce its energy
   consumption and environmental footprint. Leveraging digitalization, in
   the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in
   revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is
   transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design,
   construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This
   study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable
   buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to
   examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital
   technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building
   Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive
   manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT),
   machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and
   cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building
   sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their
   functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends,
   challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that
   digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible,
   energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource
   utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing
   environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real -time data
   collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances
   energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30\%
   -50\% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040.
   While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of
   improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several
   challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks
   associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer
   awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations
   are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the
   adoption of digital technologies.},

Abstract = {This manuscript presents the bicriteria optimization of a polygeneration
   system to be installed in a tertiary sector building, considering
   economic and environmental objective functions. Electricity, hot water,
   steam, and cooling demands were considered. The bicriteria problem
   considered the annual costs and the annual carbon footprint. Updated
   environmental information was obtained through the application of the
   Life Cycle Assessment methodology and implemented within a Mixed Integer
   Linear Programming (MILP) model, along with economic and legal data.
   Solar photovoltaic energy and biomass were available, as well as natural
   gas and diesel. The energy system could import and export electricity to
   the electric grid. Individual optimal solutions were obtained from
   economic (annual costs) and environmental (annual carbon footprint)
   viewpoints were different, and the epsilon-constraint method was
   utilized to tackle these conflicting objectives. It was verified that
   significant reductions in annual costs could be obtained if the annual
   carbon footprint was partially compromised. A configuration based on one
   gas engine, two biomass boilers and three mechanical chillers was
   recommended, with an annual carbon footprint of 2,895,909 kg CO2-eq/year
   (approximately 570,000 kg CO2-eq/year less each year in comparison with
   the economic optimal) at a total annual cost of R\$ 1,429,435.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to provide a lifecycle building
   sustainability evaluation method to guide different stakeholders in how
   to apply sustainable practices and maintain the expected sustainability.
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) is selected to be a platform to
   integrate all the information to improve interoperability. Green
   standards are embedded in the BIM model and a rule-based system is
   developed to automatically evaluate the design and the building
   performance. Data are collected by using a Real-Time Location System
   (RTLS) and are used to update the BIM model. The as-built model is
   checked to see if it matches the sustainability aspects regarding the
   construction processes. During operation, energy consumption data are
   collected and analyzed. The performance of the building is checked to
   see if the designed features reach the sustainability goals. By
   integrating the BIM, RTLS, and other information, a prototype system of
   lifecycle sustainability evaluation is developed and tested.},

Abstract = {Today, many researchers working on the information management process in
   construction recognize the problem of modelling complex product-related
   data structures. Furthermore, many experts doubt whether an
   all-inclusive-product-model is a solution for an integrated information
   environment that should efficiently support the life cycle of a product.
   It seems that the rich experiences to the product modelling gathered
   during the last decade does not lead necessarily to better models but
   rather to the awareness that the more complex the product models are,
   the more rigid and the less usable they become in practice. These
   recognitions already led to some suggestions for the future integration
   methods and product modelling like building smaller domain oriented
   models and link them using mapping schemes. In this way, however, the
   complexity of the whole system hasn't decreased, even worse, it grew.
   The paper summarizes some deficiencies of complex product models and
   then introduces a solution, called Virtual product model, which is based
   on decomposition of a conventional product model. The concepts, basic
   components and an example of the virtual product model are described.},

Title = {Geometric parameter updating in digital twin of built assets: A
   systematic literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {73},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The use of Digital Twin (DT) is becoming increasingly widespread in the
   construction industry. Considering that buildings are complex geometric
   structures that may change throughout their lifespan, it is essential to
   maintain up-to-date DT geometry. Despite its importance, the
   relationship between a building's physical geometry and its DT
   counterpart remains under-researched due to technical, financial, and
   practical challenges. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview of current research on updating the geometry of DT in
   construction, identifying gaps and challenges for future research, with
   a focus on the life-cycle stages where updating the DT geometry is most
   relevant. Additionally, this paper examines the most used equipment and
   data collection methods, as well as the data processing and integration
   techniques used in DT. This study comprehensively reviews and analyses
   the DT concept, which involves the creation of a virtual model that
   accurately reflects the geometry of a physical object, and examines the
   DT concept from this perspective. Through a systematic literature review
   (SLR) and bibliographic analysis, this research examines various methods
   for updating the geometry of a DT. The methodology involved analyzing a
   final sample of 56 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. On the basis of the analysis, the study identifies six main
   directions that recent publications in this field have focused on. These
   directions highlight the main achievements and obstacles in the field
   and include the use of UAV/photogrammetry and laser scanning as data
   collection methods for building geometry, data visualization, updating
   the geometry of the virtual model in manufacturing, the application of
   DT in modular construction, and structural monitoring. Based on the SLR,
   this study has identified key areas that require further research and
   existing challenges in updating the geometry of the DT. Addressing these
   challenges will be critical to promoting the widespread adoption of DT
   in the construction industry. Therefore, the study highlights the
   importance of updating geometry data in the DT to improve the quality of
   the data and maximize the benefits of technology in the construction
   sector.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) creates a way for all parties to
   share, exchange, and manage building information throughout the
   lifecycle of the building. On the other hand, radio frequency
   identification technology (RFID) has become one of the key technologies
   for automatic data collection and information storage. RFID can store
   building lifecycle information and context-aware information in a
   distributed database, so it can be considered as a component of the
   building information model. Therefore a standardized definition of the
   RFID components in the BIM is required. This paper proposes a standard
   method for adding RFID data definitions to BIM, and maps RFID data to
   related items in the BIM database. This study also defines the
   relationship between RFID tags and building components, and proposes the
   use of predefined relationships. The method of associating BIM data and
   RFID data can automatically select data related to RFID tag data by the
   relationship defined in BIM. Finally, the technical feasibility of the
   proposed method is proved by actual case test in the existing BIM
   software.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling is a modern technique that has contributed
   in improvement of construction industries. Early detection of hazards
   during the life cycle of the project will contribute to protect the
   working environment from exposure to risks that will affect the time and
   cost. The changing nature of the sites makes it difficult in identifying
   the fall risks accurately. Based on BIM 4D simulation, the objective of
   this study is to create a computer model by using BIM technology to help
   accurately determine (a) the hazards of falling from the edges (b) the
   hazards from struck by falling objects, by relying on the opinions of
   safety experts in identifying potential risks and demonstrating the
   effectiveness of this technique in facilitating hazards acknowledgment.
   In this research, Iraqi safety rules and safety rules of OSHA were
   adopted. The research idea was applied to a school building project
   under construction as a case study to benefit from the research outputs
   in improving the safety of school's buildings projects. The results
   displayed that the model prepared by the researchers helped the safety
   managers in understanding the details and sequence of work easily, thus
   contributed to the precise identification of the falling hazards, use
   suitable safety equipment for each risk, in addition to the possibility
   of using this model as a training program for workers in the workplace
   to help give an idea of the nature of risk which they may be exposed it,
   increase safety communication and generate time schedule empty from
   risks. Safety managers believe that this model can contribute to improve
   workplaces safety and prevent time and cost losses due to reliance on
   inaccurate methods based on static 2D schemes and sense in risk
   identification.},

Title = {Exploring the Moral Hazard Evolutionary Mechanism for BIM Implementation
   in an Integrated Project Team},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Integrated project delivery (IPD) is a new emerging delivery system,
   contributes to increase value to the owner, reduces waste and maximizes
   efficiency in the life cycle of projects. However, IPD system has not
   yet shifted from pilot-alike or particular-purposed cases to large-scale
   applications. The huge advantages of building information modeling (BIM)
   are far from being exploited, which directly leads to the delivered
   outcomes below expectations, thereby causing obstacles to widespread
   application of IPD system. The reasons impeding the successful
   application of BIM has been a hot topic. Previous studies suggested that
   moral hazard behavior is a critical inducer leading to the undesirable
   outcomes. However, very few studies have studied the evolution mechanism
   of moral hazard behavior for BIM application. To fill this knowledge
   gap, this study proposed a novel model, aiming to capture dynamically
   the interactive behavior of BIM-based strategy selections using
   evolutionary game theory. Five parameters of monitoring cost,
   proprietary cost, incentive payment, punishment and speculative benefit
   are extracted and defined in the proposed model. Numerical simulations
   are conducted with MATLAB 2016a. The simulation results showed that when
   incentive payment is higher than the sum of speculative benefit and
   proprietary cost, interactive behavior of both game players will move
   toward the optimal portfolio strategy. Incentive payment and punishment
   have negative correlations with the probability of moral hazard behavior
   for BIM application. Parameters of speculative benefit and proprietary
   cost affect positively implementation probability of moral hazard
   behavior of employing BIM. This study can provide theoretical and
   managerial implications for integrated project managers and related
   government department to improve implementation of BIM and IPD system,
   and also contribute to its sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Construction projects have numerous variable factors affecting the value
   of life cycle-cost (LCC) and there is interaction between these factors,
   leading to complicated process. Therefore the current LCC models suffer
   from the absence of a standardized and a simple methodology of both the
   collection data and estimation LCC. Identification of the significant
   cost factors affecting the output of LCC is important step before
   embarking upon the collection of progress information. Furthermore,
   components of construction differ in their cost and time-importance, and
   thus management effort must be equivalently distributed. The concept of
   cost significant items (CSIs) is the best method to simplify estimation
   methodology as well as the collection data of construction projects. In
   general, The CSIs concept aims to determine the small number of items
   which represent a constant percentage of the LCC of construction
   projects. Therefore, this paper aims to present the explanation of each
   stage of LCC, the current classifications of asset components, the CSIs
   concept and previous practice of the significant cost items on the
   construction sector.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is facing a challenge to move towards a more
   sustainable sector with energy-efficient buildings and sustainable
   design features. Building design and construction process are
   conditioned by numerous sustainability regulations and assessment
   measures. With the increasing use of building simulations, the potential
   of improving design features and promoting efficient construction has
   become a routine practice, starting at early stages of design and
   carried out throughout the life cycle of a building. Nevertheless, the
   construction process is currently lacking the presence of integrated
   systems that allow dynamic compliance checking of design features with
   building regulations using instant results from building simulation
   tools. Such integrated system requires access to regulatory compliance
   data and appropriate information exchange mechanism between building
   information model, regulatory requirements and building simulations
   tools. This paper will present an initiative for developing an
   integrated system that facilitates managing building performance
   dynamically through an appropriate information management process
   combining sustainability regulatory and building simulations with
   building information modeling. The paper will present a valid
   implementation results of compliance checking against some criteria of
   BREEAM assessment process. The quantitative analysis of the results
   revealed that more than 50\% of compliance requirements cannot be fully
   automated and still requires users input. This is due to the fact that
   the IFC data model used for data extraction lacks a representation of
   certain domains of data.},

Title = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) for transportation infrastructure -
   Literature review, applications, challenges, and recommendations},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {257-281},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Transportation infrastructure is a critical component to a nation's
   economy, security, and wellbeing. In order to keep up with the rising
   population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective
   technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but
   also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain
   the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been
   widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and
   technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation
   industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review
   and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total
   of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure
   were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and
   published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main
   categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were
   reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze
   the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to
   help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this
   paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and
   critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation
   infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this
   domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends,
   applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and
   limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed.
   Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the
   foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed
   to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and
   industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective
   techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation
   infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for
   transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research
   has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results
   also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and
   schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing
   collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most
   challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation
   infrastructure.},

Title = {A bibliometric review of zero waste in the built environment using
   VOSviewer: evolution, hotspots, and prospects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The global construction industry presents a significant challenge to
   environmental sustainability, sparking increasing concerns regarding its
   environmental impact. Zero Waste (ZW) has become a comprehensive waste
   management approach within the construction sector. However, there is a
   notable absence of systematic reviews in this field. Bibliometrics has
   played a pivotal role in advancing new methodologies for systematic
   reviews. To address this gap, our study employs VOSviewer to
   systematically review the research domain of ZW, exploring research
   trends, international collaborations, primary authors, research domains,
   and literature. Our findings reveal a pronounced upward trend in
   research dedicated to achieving zero waste goals in the built
   environment, aligning with escalating global environmental concerns.
   Research in this realm has thrived notably in China, Australia, and
   England, with these countries contributing significantly to relevant
   studies. Co-occurrence analysis highlights key themes, such as
   construction waste reduction, sustainable construction, circular design,
   prefabrication, and Building Information Modelling (BIM). Notably,
   system dynamics and BIM have emerged as crucial modelling techniques.
   Moreover, this study emphasises the adoption of circular economy
   principles, the efficacy of prefabrication, and the role of BIM in waste
   management. Future research directions encompass exploring global
   variations, investigating the impact of technology, engaging
   stakeholders, and considering regulatory frameworks. Despite its
   limitations, this study underscores the mounting global interest in ZW
   research, providing a foundation for future exploration and
   collaboration in sustainable construction and environmental management.},

Title = {TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL FOR BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING BASED
   VIRTUAL REALITY (BIM-VR) IN COST ESTIMATION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {914-925},
Abstract = {The accuracy of cost estimation during the preliminary stage of a
   construction project is imperative. However, owing to limited
   accessibility of information, the level of accuracy required at this
   stage of a project is extremely difficult to be attained. In like
   manner, the risks of budget shortages or cost overruns are likely to
   surge exponentially due to an incompetent or a lackadaisical approach
   towards life-cycle costing. Hence, this study proposes BIM-based VR as a
   preliminary estimating solution which is purported to nip the
   aforementioned issues in the bud. BIM-VR enables BQ to be updated
   automatically as stakeholders performs modifications on-the-go, allowing
   speedy and highly accurate design adjustments throughout the project. On
   this front, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was adopted to
   determine the acceptance level of BIM-based VR technology in Malaysia.
   Data was acquired via a questionnaire survey, of which 92 out of 180
   distributions were accepted for analysis, accounting to a respectable
   response rate of 51\%. Consequentially, Principal Component Analysis
   result revealed that `Saving Cost and Resources' is the most significant
   factor for BIM acceptance. Conversely, `Presence of Skill Gap' was found
   to be the biggest stumbling block for BIM-based VR in cost estimation.
   Relationship analysis from the TAM also unveiled that the challenges of
   BIM-based VR did not produce mediating effect towards attitude and
   intention to use. This implies that the intention of construction
   professionals to adopt the technology wasn't impeded by its challenges.
   Significantly, this study served as a benchmark in uncovering new
   possibilities of BIM and VR in project cost management, where the
   reliability and accuracy of conventional procurement can be enhanced
   with technology, particularly in BQ documentation, to fulfill the rising
   expectations of construction stakeholders across the globe.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the importance of embodied carbon is
   growing in relation to assessing the environmental impact of buildings.
   This paper investigates how designers are looking to tackle this, and
   the effectiveness of some of the methods chosen. Although a number of
   commercial and non-commercial organisations are developing in-house
   tools to calculate embodied carbon, these lack the flexibility to be
   adopted by a wide range of users as well as the efficiency required to
   be appealing to designers at the early stages of a design. An
   alternative to these stand-alone tools is offered through the
   functionality of Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, which is
   capable of incorporating embodied carbon assessments as part of the
   normal design process. The potential of plug-in tools to obtain embodied
   carbon data from suppliers is an area that remains to be explored
   further. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {BIM-Based Maintenance Data Processing Mechanism through COBie Standard
   Development for Port Facility},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the AECO field, there have been many efforts to transform the design,
   construction, and maintenance methods that have been carried out in the
   traditional way based on document-based data into digital ones. BIM
   makes it possible for the information necessary for the entire
   construction process to be transformed into a language that computers
   can understand. In the field of architecture, BIM has been actively used
   throughout the entire construction life cycle through steady research
   since the 2000s, while COBie was developed in order to deliver
   information generated in the design and construction phase to the
   maintenance phase based on the BIM environment. In the field of
   infrastructure, however, digital data-based maintenance information
   management has not been actively studied. In particular, in the case of
   a port, once a facility is built, it has to be maintained for a longer
   period than other facilities, so facility maintenance is of utmost
   importance. Therefore, this study applied COBie, which is being used in
   the architecture field (building), to the port field. To this end, the
   COBie standard format in the port field was developed based on the port
   facility object breakdown structure and property breakdown structure.
   The port COBie developed through this study is included when the BIM
   model is converted to the IFC model so that facility management can be
   performed through the IFC-based viewer in the future. The port COBie
   schema developed in this study can be expanded to other fields such as
   roads and bridges in the future.},

Title = {Data-Driven Modeling Algorithms for Cable-Stayed Bridges Considering
   Mechanical Behavior},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Digital transformation of bridge engineering utilizes distinct modeling
   techniques to combine domain knowledge with digital information
   modeling. In particular, a long-span bridge is a key link in a
   transportation network, with more than 100 years of service life. BIM
   (building information modeling) is an effort towards improving the
   current data delivery in the construction industry. However, it is
   limited by the rigidity that geometry affords; this is particularly
   problematic when the structure to be modelled is a deformable body. The
   quality and value of information for the bridges can be enhanced by
   establishing a data-driven digital information delivery through the
   entire life-cycle of the bridges. In this study, a data-driven modeling
   algorithm for cable-stayed bridges is proposed, considering the geometry
   change determining the mechanical behavior. Data delivery is
   accomplished by a combination of datasets and algorithms based on the
   different purposes. The master information model considers alignment of
   the bridge and essential constraints for the main members, such as
   stiffening girders, pylons, and cables, between the digital models.
   Geometry control of the stiffening girders and tension forces of cables
   are supported by the modeling algorithm of the interoperable target
   configuration under dead load analysis. The suggested modeling algorithm
   is verified by comparison with previous analytical studies on
   cable-stayed bridges.},

Abstract = {Traditional technology acceptance model (TAM) studies establish and
   verify the model of causal relationship between variables by factor
   analysis or structural equation modeling. However, some technology is
   highly complicated, not all respondents have thorough comprehension.
   Certain variables are not compatible with assumption of independence,
   and causal relationship cannot be analyzed accurately if mass samplings
   are difficult to obtain, resulting in mistaken conclusions. The study
   establishes TAM through the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation
   Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, which considers the influences of
   inconformity between variables. Respondents may completely understand
   the technology, but may not adequately express it through limitations of
   mass sampling. Score quantification through traditional investigation
   asks respondents to make a choice from limited wordings in order to
   stress maximum attribution without considering the fuzzy thinking of
   humans, resulting in an imprecise summary. This study adopts the fuzzy
   DEMATEL method to calculate the causal relationship and level of mutual
   effect, building on the technology acceptance model by applying the
   Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) system, providing administrator
   references to improve promotion of new technology to solve complicated
   and difficult problems in practice. The example of Product Life Cycle
   Management adopted by the Taiwan optronics manufacturing industry is
   used to explain the application and effect of this theory. The research
   found that the influence is similar to the TAM2 model based on the fuzzy
   DEMATEL method. The major difference is the subjective standard (X-5)
   did not affect the impression (X-8), while the experience (X-6) directly
   affects the purpose of use (X-1) and the purpose of use (X-3) which also
   affects useful knowledge (X-2). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Quality assurance (QA) plays an essential role in the construction
   project life cycle. During the construction phase, discrepancies between
   as-built structures and as-designed models can lead to schedule delays
   and cost overruns. Currently, QAfor buildings is primarily conducted by
   inspectors physically touring the building to visually inspect and
   manually measure discrepancies between the design model and the finished
   structure. This manual approach is time-consuming, costly, and error
   prone. In this study, we proposed a vision-based approach toward
   automated QA using images collected via virtual cameras in a game
   engine. Specifically, our approach aimed to address the problem of the
   lack of large-scale labeled open datasets for training reliablemachine
   learning models for the task of semantic segmentation of building
   components (i.e., labeling of each pixel to a specific class of building
   component). The approach leveraged Building InformationModeling (BIM)
   authoring tools and a game engine to automatically generate images of
   virtual buildings with pixelwise labels. Given the labeled images, a
   convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model can be implemented for
   accurate segmentation of the images. To validate the approach, we used
   one building information model as the testbed. In total, 20,700 images
   (18,000 for training, 2200 for validation and 500 for testing) were
   generated from the BIM. Performance of the CNN segmentation model was
   measured by the mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), which achieved
   0.89. The result is significant since it rivals the current
   state-of-the-art from the Architecture Engineering and Construction
   (AEC) domain. The approach proposed in this study lays a concrete step
   toward automated QA, where inspectors can leverage the trained CNN model
   to automatically label images collected onsite during or after
   construction to avoid labor-intensive manual inspections.},

Title = {IFC Class Assignment add-on: BIM modelling for architectural and
   engineering projects using Blender},
Journal = {DYNA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {99},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a working methodology for the
   design and management of construction projects that facilitates
   collaboration and communication between the different parties involved.
   It is based on the digital threedimensional representation of
   infrastructures within the field of architecture and civil engineering.
   The generated models are true data containers, capable of storing the
   geometric and semantic information necessary to support the design,
   construction and maintenance operations of the assets. This methodology
   promotes data exchange between different software tools through
   interoperability and the use of standards. Usually in the development of
   projects throughout their life cycle, commercial, closed-source BIM
   software is used. This generally leads to limitations in
   interoperability and data reuse. This paper details advances in the use
   of Blender, a free and open-source software (FOSS), to support BIM
   workflows in construction projects. The paper addresses the automation
   of the process to export a 3D Blender model to a BIM model in IFC
   (Industry Foundation Classes). The IFC Class Assignment add-on is
   developed, which allows the automated assignment of IFC classes to the
   different elements of the 3D model in Blender to convert it into a BIM
   model, using scripts written in Python. The proposed extension is able
   to generate, in an agile and simple way, digital models in IFC4,
   adequately storing the geometric and semantic information of its
   components. The results provide a tool that contributes to automate the
   creation of BIM models in an open-source software such as Blender,
   simplifying modelling processes and supporting collaboration and
   standardisation in architectural and engineering projects.},

   Lifecycle: A Move toward nD Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) to support
   various tasks of building lifecycle management (BLM) has been reported
   in a range of studies. However, during its lifetime, a building is an
   important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must
   not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its
   participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what
   way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its
   surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been
   reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building
   lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a
   building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however
   potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet
   been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of
   application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM
   processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings,
   site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby
   facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical
   framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM
   and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all
   stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable
   decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management
   of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established
   that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated
   solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective. (c) 2021 American

Title = {A Traceability Framework to Enable Circularity in the Built Environment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) has been receiving an
   increasing amount of attention in the built asset industry. One of the
   key aspects of CE is traceability, which can enable the identification
   and tracking of materials, products, and their associated value
   throughout their entire lifecycle. However, achieving traceability has
   been challenging in the built asset industry due to the complex nature
   of construction projects and a lack of awareness about the benefits of
   traceability in achieving the circularity of building products and
   materials. Despite recent studies and efforts, a limited number of
   frameworks or guidelines exist to support traceability in the built
   asset industry. In many cases, several of the existing traceability
   standards, strategies, and guidelines must be identified and framed to
   support development and implementation of theories and models applicable
   within the built asset domain. This paper proposes a traceability
   framework consisting of five key components covering: the main purposes
   of traceability enabling CE principles, the role of traceability across
   asset lifecycle stages, the type of data needed to support traceability,
   the value of collaboration and coordination among industry stakeholders,
   and key enablers and drivers of traceability from technological and
   organizational perspectives. The proposed framework developed in this
   paper contributes to the effort aimed at framing the knowledge domain of
   CE through the traceability of products and materials in the built
   environment.},

Abstract = {The federation of models is a pillar of the BIM (Building Information
   Modelling) approach: it allows to keep the contents of each discipline
   separate during the modelling-creation phase, and to merge them together
   later during the project management phase, from its feasibility to the
   construction site, to the management of the entire life-cycle of the
   building.
   Generally, these models refer to specific disciplines and the
   architectural, plant and structural model are always identified.When the
   asset belongs to Cultural Heritage, more generically an existing
   building, the BIM approach (at this point HBIM - Historic Building
   Information Modelling) is faced with an additional level of complexity
   since it is necessary to model something existing (the building in fact)
   and of which not much information is known. The geometric complexity of
   the asset often aggravates this situation because if the parametric
   modelling is preferred, it is difficult to represent such irregular
   morphologies, and if the surface modelling and a more geometrical detail
   is preferred, the model becomes very heavy.In many cases the choice is
   to approximate reality as best as possible through specific and
   tailor-made modelling approaches, often complex and with some borderline
   methods, if compared to BIM logic. In other cases, however, it makes
   sense to define when the geometric complexity and the reliability of the
   model are necessary, and when, instead, a simplification is required in
   order to effectively manage the information.
   The case study presented in this paper is the Arch of Augustus, in
   Aosta, for the HBIM approach it has been chosen to separate the two
   approaches,placing side by side the federated models referred to the
   classical disciplines with two models of the current state: one very
   accurate with the purpose of maintaining all the quality of acquired 3D
   geometric information, while the other absolutely schematic, necessary
   as a 3D index for the information.
   The approach described here, however, requires a preliminary reflection
   in order to define the BIM granularity - the smallest object in the
   model - and to define the methodological procedures that allow the
   bidirectional relationship between survey model and conceptual model.
   This paper provides insigth oif the importance of the relation between
   survey model and conseptual model. Future works will try to make this
   relation more stronger and efficient.},

Abstract = {The application of building information modeling (BIM) is in its early
   stages in Iran and there is a lack of contract forms for BIM projects to
   overcome its barriers. To propose a contract form for BIM, this study
   conducted a literature review followed by an expert interview to
   identify legal issues and risks associated with the adoption of BIM in
   the Iranian construction industry. Through the literature survey, 31
   items were extracted as BIM legal issues. This list was validated and
   completed through interviews, and hence a list of 41 legal
   considerations to be addressed in BIM contracts was identified. The
   41-item list was used to propose contract provisions as a BIM contract
   addendum. Two local design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB)
   contractual standards of Iran were reviewed. Then the proposed
   contractual conditions were incorporated into the contract forms in Iran
   to achieve BIM-based DBB and DB contractual standards. This research
   adds to the body of knowledge by developing a complete BIM contract
   addendum. The literature review of the study is not confined to Iranian
   literature; therefore, the results of the study are expected to be
   suitable for other countries at a similar or more advanced level of BIM
   perception. Practical ApplicationsBuilding information modeling is one
   of the emerging concepts in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry. Despite its numerous advantages, the
   implementation of BIM gives rise to some issues and challenges
   throughout the project life cycle. One major challenge in BIM adoption
   is the lack of contractual guidelines, which leads to ambiguity in BIM
   legal aspects. Many of the legal risks associated with BIM can be
   managed through contractual provisions. However, the current legal
   system and common contract forms are major impediments to full
   implementation of BIM as a novel collaborative technology. Therefore, a
   well-structured and clear set of BIM-specific contractual provisions
   will establish a legal foundation for BIM, help overcome barriers to its
   adoption, and encourage its utilization in projects. The current study
   first identifies the most common legal issues associated with BIM
   adoption in construction projects. Then the study proposes a
   comprehensive contract form that includes all the required clauses and
   provisions to address all these legal risks.},

Abstract = {Building fa \& ccedil;ades represent one of the most critical elements
   affecting a city's quality of life, and they impact the country's
   economic income by attracting visitors. However, performance data on fa
   \& ccedil;ades are limited or incomplete, making it challenging for
   designers to evaluate their effectiveness in energy efficiency, thermal
   performance, durability, and other key performance metrics. This paper
   presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating and prioritizing
   material selection criteria in building cladding, establishing the
   relationship with available alternatives, and integrating
   decision-making processes with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
   automate the Value Engineering (VE) concept. The material selection
   criteria from the literature and international standard manual were
   identified, and their criteria weight was then evaluated using SWARA
   (stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis). Additionally, WASPAS
   (weighted aggregated sum product assessment) was utilized to evaluate
   the alternative cladding materials based on the defined criteria and
   their associated quality weight (QW). The life cycle cost (LCC) of the
   alternatives was computed. The VE was computed and then ranked based on
   the QW and LCC of the alternatives. The procedure was connected to the
   BIM model to automate the assessment, specifying the necessary
   parameters and the BIM computation. A case study of an office building
   fa \& ccedil;ade was conducted to validate the proposed framework. In
   this study, the significant criteria were durability, wind load
   resistance, and thermal insulation. This approach enables executives to
   evaluate cladding selection, ensuring efficient decision-making
   processes. The proposed method and its results were subjected to expert
   testing, and the satisfaction rate exceeded 80\%, confirming the
   framework's reliability in evaluating alternatives. This paper enhances
   the understanding of material selection methodologies and provides a
   valuable contribution to the field of construction management.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to review and provide recommendations to
   extend the current open standard data models for describing monitoring
   systems and circular economy precepts for built assets. Open standard
   data models enable robust and efficient data exchange which underpins
   the successful implementation of a circular economy. One of the largest
   opportunities to reduce the total life cycle cost of a built asset is to
   use the building information modelling (BIM) approach during the
   operational phase because it represents the largest share of the entire
   cost. BIM models that represent the actual conditions and performance of
   the constructed assets can boost the benefits of the installed
   monitoring systems and reduce maintenance and operational costs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper presents a horizontal investigation of current BIM data
   models and their use for describing circular economy principles and
   performance monitoring of built assets. Based on the investigation, an
   extension to the industry foundation classes (IFC) specification,
   recommendations and guidelines are presented which enable to describe
   circular economy principles and asset monitoring using IFC.
   Findings
   Current open BIM data models are not sufficiently mature yet. This
   limits the interoperability of the BIM approach and the implementation
   of circular economy principles. An overarching approach to extend the
   current standards is necessary, which considers aspects related to not
   only modelling the monitoring system but also data management and
   analysis.
   Originality/value
   To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study that identifies
   requirements for data model standards in the context current linear
   economic model of making, using and disposing is growing unsustainably
   far beyond the finite limits of planet of a circular economy. The
   results of this study set the basis for the extension of current
   standards required to apply the circular economy precepts.},

Abstract = {In this study, we aimed to implement information obtained and refined
   from garden elements in heritage conservation, monitoring, and
   management to precisely construct an information model of classical
   Chinese gardens, including information on the garden entity, garden
   space, and garden attributes, etc., and to improve the management
   efficiency of classical Chinese royal gardens. Three-dimensional laser
   scanning technology and point cloud information were used to accurately
   collect and process digital information from classical Chinese royal
   gardens. After classifying and processing the point cloud data,
   correlations therein could be further assessed and used to greatly
   improve the accuracy and management efficiency of spatial information.
   To provide a more convenient solution for the subsequent conservation
   and management of landscape heritage, a method for establishing a
   three-dimensional digital information database and a full life-cycle
   application management platform for classical Chinese royal gardens is
   proposed in this research. This method has broad applications for the

Abstract = {In order to manage analysis and project processes at a territorial,
   urban and architectural scale, linking information to metric data is an
   increasingly important topic.
   At a geographic and cartographic stage, the function of storing,
   managing and viewing data and information is performed by GIS
   (Geographic Information Systems), where vector features as points,
   lines, polygons are gathered in layers connected to an attribute table.
   In a similar way, when scale factor increases, for buildings and other
   engineering works there is a growing necessity to preserve data or
   attributes together with the features where they belong. For this
   purpose, a major role is played by BIM (Building Information Modeling),
   a modelling process in which the parts of a building are hierarchically
   organized and every feature is connected to an information table
   containing all data useful for the ongoing working process or for
   managing the life cycle of the modelled building or infrastructure.
   While the two systems are similar in concept, at the moment they suffer
   lack of mutual communication, especially in conveying informations from
   a platform to another.
   Studying relationships and possible connections between different data
   storage environments like GIS and BIM is one of the research topics of
   DATA - Developing Abandoned Transurban Areas, a research project now in
   progress at University of Padova, involving Departments of Civil,
   Architectural and Environmental Engineering and Industrial Engineering.
   The main goal of the project is to design pilot regeneration scenarios
   for wasted or underused places, focusing on a part of the western
   peri-urban area of Padova marked by the overlapping of partially
   abandoned industrial or commercial buildings, transport infrastructures
   like a ring road and a railway, residential fabric and green or
   agricultural land.
   Among DATA key features there is a multi-scale approach: in a framework
   where urban peripheries are considered a relation system between a city
   and the surrounding territory, the project aims to combine the methods
   of urban and territorial analysis with a design concept in which
   industrial landmarks or empty spaces become the core of possible urban
   transformations.
   Therefore, starting from data mining and management related to the areas
   of interest, procedures for GIS to BIM data transfer are surveyed and
   implemented; then, the buildings, facilities and building complex
   involved in scenarios design will be modelled in detail, and relevant
   building-scale information will be added.
   At the moment, within the project, a pipeline to convert a GIS map of
   the buildings in our area of interest into a BIM 3D model provided with
   all the information of the GIS layer has been developed. Then, when the
   BIM model is modified, its updated attributes can be taken back to the
   GIS level.
   The aim of this paper is to describe the workflow for GIS-BIM
   interoperability in DATA project, results achieved at the moment and
   future goals and applications.},

Abstract = {Science and engineering intermingle in the area of construction.
   Engineering works, often of great dimensions and design life cycle of
   many decades, have to be designed on a scientific basis since the safety
   of hundreds of users depends on their design. The task of scientific
   institutions is to define the construction performance within categories
   that correspond to the contemporary level of knowledge and technology. A
   construction appraiser who speaks out in a way that ensures
   unquestionable competence about the performance of elements and
   buildings (existing and under construction), should be convinced of the
   scientific basis of his opinions. A comparison of construction sections
   vs. basic requirements presents an archetype of the science of
   construction. A matrix of the science of construction reveals its
   multi-faceted nature; if related to time-the issue of durability has to
   be considered, and if related to the scale-the complexity. Defining the
   construction performance in terms of technical features is a constant
   search for a relationship between the material model and the usability
   model of a building. The construction industry uses a lot of ``rules of
   thumb{''}, more than any other sector of technology. In the era of
   computer-aided design, CAD, and building information modelling (BIM),
   those rules of thumb remain invaluable verification tools.},

Title = {BIM business value for asset owners through effective asset information
   management},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3/4},
Pages = {181-200},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the processes, tools and
   techniques of strategic asset information management (AIM) for built
   assets, and how the asset information content enhances the proficiency
   of asset managers to effectively manage their assets throughout their
   life cycle by utilising building information modelling (BIM) and asset
   management (AM) systems. For most asset managers, the problem is not the
   lack of information about their assets, but the abundance of it, and
   most especially the absence of established processes and protocols to
   effectively manage large sets of asset data. Therefore, it is crucial to
   develop a strategy to control and manage this information in order for
   asset managers to harness its potential and realise value from their
   organisation's information assets..
   Design/methodology/approach
   A qualitative case study strategy was used to investigate the effective
   management of asset data in an AIM system. Seven sets of interviews were
   conducted and nine respondents were interviewed. These were analysed
   through qualitative thematic analysis using the NVivo software.
   Findings
   The paper identifies six dimensions of value that BIM contributes to AM,
   which are: management, commerce, efficiency, industry, user and
   technology value. Also, the paper demonstrates that there is real value
   to be derived by the asset owner from the effective management of asset
   information. The study highlights that the value of BIM is not inherent
   but would require many other processes to deliver value to the
   organisation.
   Originality/value
   The key value of the paper is that it identifies important techniques
   for managing asset data and how asset information is collected,
   organised, stored, controlled, analysed, secured, shared and reported
   within a virtual AIM system for strategic management-based decisions.},

Title = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capabilities in the Design and
   Planning of Rural Settlements in China: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in
   China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural
   settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in
   China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven
   development between urban and rural in China, the environmental
   conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are
   still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and
   residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to
   optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a
   multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can
   significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements
   in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential
   experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to
   perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the
   design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this
   aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The
   review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and
   September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were
   adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through
   this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have
   significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and
   planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D
   modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental
   analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the
   discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that
   BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements'
   design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge
   management, simulation, and modeling. Based on the research results, it
   can be identified that knowledge management capabilities in BIM can
   effectively provide information support and knowledge assistance
   throughout the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China.
   BIM's simulation and modeling capabilities can simulate and demonstrate
   the rural environment and their internal structures in rural
   settlements' design and planning phase to achieve their environmental
   optimization, residential comfort improvement, clash detection, disaster
   prevention, and expenditure reduction. Moreover, the challenge and
   future directions of BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase
   of rural settlements in China are discussed and analyzed. This study can
   effectively promote and optimize the BIM utilization in the design and
   planning phase of rural settlements in China, to better enhance their
   environmental quality and residential experience.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric review of the
   economic areas of green building (GBE). The aim is to methodically
   examine and summarize the state-of-the-art of the GBE body of knowledge.
   To this end, this study analyses 1713 GBE-related bibliographic records
   retrieved from the Web of Science by using the quantitative method of
   knowledge mapping. The knowledge base, knowledge domain, and knowledge
   evolution of how they interacted with each other are explored using
   document co-citation analysis and keywords co-citation analysis of the
   existing body of literature. The research findings are informative in
   recognizing and interpreting the underlying structure and trends in GBE.
   A knowledge map provides a valuable and instructive understanding of the
   evolution and status quo of the GBE knowledge body, as well as assisting
   in recognizing the gaps and deficiencies involved. The results will help
   in understanding how GBE knowledge is evolving and its role played in
   green building, and thus provide suggestions of how academic research
   can enhance sustainability practices in terms of economic area in the
   future.},

Title = {Rheology and buildability of sustainable cement-based composites
   containing micro-crystalline cellulose for 3D-printing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {3D printing is becoming increasingly popular for construction owing to
   its reduced environmental impact and lower energy demand than
   conventional manufacturing. Rapid application of this technology relies
   largely on the development of high-performance cement-based composites
   compatible with 3D printers. This study aims to develop high-quality and
   sustainable cement-based composites containing microcrystalline
   cellulose (MCC) that can satisfy the requirements for 3D printing. The
   workability, rheological behavior, buildability, and mechanical
   properties of the cement-based composites for 3D printing were examined
   systematically. The rheological analysis revealed that the plastic
   viscosity and yield stress of mortars with 1 wt\% MCC were increased by
   20.9\% and 190.0\%, respectively, compared with those of mortars without
   MCC. The buildability of mortars with 1 wt\% MCC was also improved, and
   the printed structure exhibited neither large cracks among the printed
   filaments nor distorted components in the printing process. Compared
   with the mortars without MCC, the 28-d compressive and flexural
   strengths of the mortars with 1 wt\% MCC were increased by 18.6\% and
   12.5\%, respectively. In addition, the carbon emissions from the overall
   life cycle of a printed residence were quantified by considering the
   material attributes of additive manufacturing and using software tools
   to conduct building information modeling (BIM)-enabled life cycle
   assessment (LCA) modeling. The results indicated that compared with the
   mortars without MCC at equivalent mechanical strengths, the mortars
   containing 1 wt\% MCC could reduce the CO2 emissions by 6.82\%. The
   comprehensive improvement in rheological properties and buildability as
   well as the environmental benefits can promote the sustainable
   industrial utilization of MCC-reinforced cement-based materials in the
   3D-printing industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {BIM-based Construction Networks (BbCNs) are teams comprising members
   from several specialist organisations to undertake BIM-related tasks on
   BIM-enabled projects. Fostering collaboration within BbCNs is a top
   priority for construction project managers, yet no explicit body of
   knowledge has focused on investigating the relevant research gaps in
   knowledge. The present study intends to address this gap by plotting the
   storyline of relevant research studies in the last 10 years (2006-2016).
   A ``Collaboration Pentagon{''} consisted of context, process, task, team
   and actor as the theoretical lens is created through integration of
   relevant frameworks. The study draws upon a bibliometric analysis of
   1031 studies on BIM alongside the outcome of a qualitative evaluation of
   a total of 62 carefully selected papers on collaboration in BbCNs. The
   findings reveal that the scholarship on collaboration on BIM-enabled
   projects has predominately focused on technology as one antecedent of
   collaboration while project-related and managerial antecedents have
   remained under-researched. Moreover, though enhancing collaboration
   necessitates inclusion of all influential antecedents, studies with such
   an all-inclusive perspective are rare. The study contributes to the
   field through this inclusive Collaboration Pentagon and by providing a
   systematic and objective evaluation of available literature on
   collaboration in BbCNs and uncovering respective gaps. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Work package-based information modeling for resource-constrained
   scheduling of construction projects},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {109},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As an essential problem in construction management, the
   resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has been studied
   for decades; however, an integrated information model that fully
   supports the RCPSP solving process is still lacking. Though building
   information modeling (BIM) was proposed to meet the data requirements in
   the building life cycle, some scheduling and resource information are
   not considered in information transfers between the information model
   and the RCPSP mathematical model. This paper presents an integrated
   approach that enables fluent data flow from the information model to the
   RCPSP model for construction scheduling. Within this approach, a work
   package-based information model is proposed to capture all the required
   data of the RCPSP. Then, a semiautomatic method that integrates
   multisource data is introduced to form the proposed information model,
   and an adaptive data transmission method is used to support a designed
   multimode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP)
   model. The models and approaches are validated using the data of an
   actual project, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency. This study
   contributes a novel integrated approach to formalizing a construction
   information model using a semiautomatic data integration approach,
   covering the information requirement and enables fluent data flow in the
   RCPSP solving process. Meanwhile, the work package-based information
   model is a successful attempt to introduce previously-gained knowledge
   into automatic schedule generation processes. Future work, such as
   extending the information model, creating new methods for RCPSP model
   generation, and data analytics, can bring new opportunities to apply
   more complex and intelligent methods in project scheduling and
   construction management.},

   of recycled materials to offset the embodied carbon footprint from
   conventional Malaysian housing construction requires to be evaluated.
   The main focus of study was to perform a comparative analysis for
   minimization of embodied carbon footprint from the conventional
   materials used Malaysian housing industry by using recycled materials. A
   typical double story semi-detached house commonly constructed in
   Malaysian tropical climate was selected as case study. The model of the
   house was generated in a virtual environment using Building information

Abstract = {In the last decades scarcity of resources and global warming have led to
   a more and more efficient building design and usage aimed to reduce
   energy consumption and CO2 emission. For increasing energy efficiency of
   buildings over the whole life cycle monitoring systems became an
   important technology. Thereby, monitoring systems are usually applied in
   combination with controlling systems for providing building automation
   of HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) components in the
   usage phase. In this paper an approach will be presented describing a
   generic framework for efficiently using of monitoring in the design
   phase as well as in the usage phase. Based on certain building criteria
   a) the selection for an efficient, best cost- benefit, HVAC system and
   b) the efficient filtering, evaluating and prioritizing of energy
   performance values like cooling/heating consumption values will be
   supported. This will be done by considering only a small set of energy
   indicators representing and covering complex building designs and usage
   scenarios. As description method for the building criteria an ontology
   approach is considered comprising and consolidating the different input
   sources and creating the base for deriving and identifying these
   criteria. Furthermore, intelligent filtering methods are proposed
   operating on the origin source models and filtering and aggregating the
   elements for mapping them to the ontology descriptions. Altogether is
   embedded in a knowledge management framework forming the mediator for
   external software like simulation or CAD software. The use of the
   knowledge management framework is intended for a company applying it
   throughout several projects and storing the gained experience in the

Abstract = {A construction project requires collaboration of a large number of
   individuals working in different organizations to deliver the project on
   time and within the budget. Architecture, engineering, and construction
   industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and
   interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of
   building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a
   shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility
   management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are
   created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful
   for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project
   planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However,
   creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An
   approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can
   improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new
   approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The
   Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that
   allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the
   Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have
   developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies
   are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3)
   how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project
   information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases.
   The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the
   provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means
   BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project
   schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective
   servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule
   information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various
   purposes.},

Abstract = {Decision support system (DSS) researchers and designers continue to look
   for unstructured organizational tasks where there is a critical need for
   intelligent computer-based support. One such decision task is
   information requirements determination. Requirements determination is
   recognized as the most crucial phase of the systems development life
   cycle. Unfortunately, most methodologies and CASE tools focus only on
   how to specify the requirements once they are determined. There is very
   little computer support for the process of determining requirements.
   This paper discusses the conceptual design and development of a
   knowledge-based DSS to support information analysts in the critical
   decision task of determining requirements for the design of effective
   information systems.  The expert modeling support system has the
   expertise to assist the analyst in studying the organization as a whole
   and in modeling the system under study in the context of the overall
   organization's goals and needs. The focus of the paper is on the
   problems associated with building the knowledge base component of the
   intelligent decision support system. A prototype implementation of the

Title = {Integrating BIM into sensor-based facilities management operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {385-400},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To mitigate the problems in sensor-based facility management (FM) such
   as lack of detailed visual information about a built facility and the
   maintenance of large scale sensor deployments, an integrated data source
   for the facility's life cycle should be used. Building information
   modeling (BIM) provides a useful visual model and database that can be
   used as a repository for all data captured or made during the facility's
   life cycle. It can be used for modeling the sensing-based system for
   data collection, serving as a source of all information for smart
   objects such as the sensors used for that purpose. Although few studies
   have been conducted in integrating BIM with sensor-based monitoring
   system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between FMs and Internet of Things (IoT) companies in
   cases encountered failed sensors has received the least attention in the
   technical literature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   conceptualize and develop a BIM-based system architecture for fault
   detection and alert generation for malfunctioning FM sensors in smart
   IoT environments during the operational phase of a building to ensure
   minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper describes an attempt to examine the applicability of BIM for
   an efficient sensor failure management system in smart IoT environments
   during the operational phase of a building. For this purpose, a
   seven-story office building with four typical types of FM-related
   sensors with all associated parameters was modeled in a commercial BIM
   platform. An integrated workflow was developed in Dynamo, a visual
   programming tool, to integrate the associated sensors
   maintenance-related information to a cloud-based tool to provide a fast
   and efficient communication platform between the building facility
   manager and IoT companies for intelligent sensor management.
   Findings
   The information within BIM allows better and more effective
   decision-making for building facility managers. Integrating building and
   sensors information within BIM to a cloud-based system can facilitate
   better communication between the building facility manager and IoT
   company for an effective IoT system maintenance. Using a developed
   integrated workflow (including three specifically designed modules) in
   Dynamo, a visual programming tool, the system was able to automatically
   extract and send all essential information such as the type of failed
   sensors as well as their model and location to IoT companies in the
   event of sensor failure using a cloud database that is effective for the
   timely maintenance and replacement of sensors. The system developed in
   this study was implemented, and its capabilities were illustrated
   through a case study. The use of the developed system can help facility
   managers in taking timely actions in the event of any sensor failure
   and/or malfunction to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Research limitations/implications
   However, there are some limitations in this work which are as follows:
   while the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using BIM in the
   maintenance planning of monitoring systems in the building, the
   developed workflow can be expanded by integrating some type of sensors
   like an occupancy sensor to the developed workflow to automatically
   record and identify the number of occupants (visitors) to prioritize the
   maintenance work; and the developed workflow can be integrated with the
   sensors' data and some machine learning techniques to automatically
   identify the sensors' malfunction and update the BIM model accordingly.
   Practical implications
   Transferring the related information such as the room location,
   occupancy status, number of occupants, type and model of the sensor,
   sensor ID and required action from the BIM model to the cloud would be
   extremely helpful to the IoT companies to actually visualize workspaces
   in advance, and to plan for timely and effective decision-making without
   any physical inspection, and to support maintenance planning decisions,
   such as prioritizing maintenance works by considering different factors
   such as the importance of spaces and number of occupancies. The
   developed framework is also beneficial for preventive maintenance works.
   The system can be set up according to the maintenance and time-based
   expiration schedules, automatically sharing alerts with FMs and IoT
   maintenance contractors in advance about the IoT parts replacement. For
   effective predictive maintenance planning, machine learning techniques
   can be integrated into the developed workflow to efficiently predict the
   future condition of individual IoT components such as data loggers and
   sensors, etc. as well as MEP components.
   Originality/value
   Lack of detailed visual information about a built facility can be a
   reason behind the inefficient management of a facility. Detecting and
   repairing failed sensors at the earliest possible time is critical to
   ensure the functional continuity of the monitoring systems. On the other
   hand, the maintenance of large-scale sensor deployments becomes a
   significant challenge. Despite its importance, few studies have been
   conducted in integrating BIM with a sensor-based monitoring system,
   providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between facility managers and IoT companies in cases
   encountered failed sensors. In this paper, a cloud-based BIM platform
   was developed for the maintenance and timely replacement of sensors
   which are critical to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services
   in sensor-based FM.},

Title = {Probability of Winning the Tender When Proposing Using BIM Strategy: A
   Case Study in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The procurement process is one of the most important phases in any
   project life cycle, particularly when it comes to selecting the right
   contractor for the job. Awarding the contract to the best bid proposal
   is a critical step to ensure the greatest value. BIM has been recognized
   as not only a geometric modelling of buildings, but also, it facilitates
   the different stages in management of construction projects. The purpose
   of this paper is to study the impact of using Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) in the tendering process from the contractor's
   perspective, based on a probability model able to predict winning
   probability, regardless of relative weight. The main objective of this
   research is to measure the likelihood of winning a tender in the case of
   implementing BIM strategy, compared with contractors who do not use BIM.
   The research uses a literature review, surveys, and interviews with
   experts to develop a model that predicts the probability of winning a
   contract; this is determined by measuring the BIM impact on each
   selection criterion in a multicriteria selection process using the
   Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to develop a probability-based model.
   The results of the survey and the interview show that BIM strategy has a
   variant influence on the score the contractor could have on each of them
   raising the probability of winning the tender. The main result of this
   paper is the property-based model, which is able to predict BIM winning
   probability regardless of relative weight, which can be applied in any
   country. Nonetheless, the Saudi case study shows that utilizing BIM when
   proposing could increase the winning probability by up to 9.42\% in the
   case of Quality-Based Selection (QBS), and to 5.5\% in the case of
   Cost-Based Selection (CBS).},

Abstract = {In the face of new modern requirements for the construction industry,
   the need for prompt and timely interaction between departments involved
   in the construction of buildings and facilities has increased. The
   structural analysis of processes at each stage of the construction life
   cycle determined the need to form a uniform information virtual space
   for the organizational structures involved in the construction of
   objects of various levels. During the research the features of the
   interaction of construction organizations and enterprises with the
   customer are studied, an algorithm for interaction between participants
   in the construction process in the uniform virtual space and an
   information model of the virtual space of construction organizations and
   enterprises is implemented. The structure of the information system is a
   client-server architecture and allows to track the progress of
   construction step by step, maintain electronic document management and
   receive services in electronic format. The uniform virtual platform will
   unite all participants in the construction process: investors,
   customers, design and survey institutes, government agencies and
   construction organizations. The proposed regulations will allow to
   create a completely new process approach to the system of interaction
   between the participating structures and the operational control system
   at each stage of the life cycle as well as help unite all participants
   in the construction process, provide them timely access and reliable
   access to sources of information about the facility.},

Title = {ActCPG framework to learn about information user requirements of a
   clinical practice guideline},
Journal = {HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-172},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A clinical practice guideline is a knowledge uptake instrument that
   supports evidence-based decision making by clinicians. It represents a
   model of a clinical process that describes the sequence of actions,
   decisions and their outcomes, and the interface with other processes
   beyond the scope of a guideline. In domains outside healthcare, the
   computerization of business processes via information systems follows a
   very rigorous design labeled as the system development life cycle. Our
   argument is that the computerization of a clinical practice guideline is
   the equivalent of building an information system for a clinical process
   and therefore should follow a similarly rigorous design method. One of
   the first and also one of the most important steps in the system
   development life cycle is learning about user information requirements.
   This paper is about a user requirements elicitation and definition
   process customized to clinical practice guideline. We propose the novel
   ActCPG conceptual framework for elicitation of basic user requirements
   for developing computer-interpreted guidelines. This framework relies on
   Activity Theory to structure and decompose information coming from a
   clinical practice guideline and associated narrative. We illustrate
   operation of the ActCPG framework with an example of a practice
   guideline for a management of clinically obese children enrolled in the
   Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario obesity program. (C) 2012

   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intelligence in Industry 4.0 has led to the development of smart
   buildings with various control systems for data collection, efficient
   optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). However,
   buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global
   energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable
   solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT
   performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive
   maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic
   methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various
   FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations.
   In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their
   ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy,
   flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
   as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations,
   such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and
   identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on
   developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their
   predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show
   promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep
   learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a
   promising area for further investigation.},

Title = {Modelling representative life cycle inventories for Swiss arable crops},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-76},
Abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. Life cycle inventories (LCIs) of
   agricultural products, infrastructure, inputs and processes are required
   to optimise food supply chains. In the past, the use of LCA was hindered
   by the limited availability of databases with LCIs for such agricultural
   inputs, processes and products in combination with LCIs of other major
   economic sectors. The ecoinvent database covers this need for the Swiss,
   and to an extent, the European context. A suitable approach bad to be
   outlined for defining representative datasets for products from arable
   crops, since there was no comprehensive survey of agricultural
   production.
   Methods. No single data source was available for defining representative
   datasets for arable crops. It was therefore decided to define model
   crops on the basis of a variety of sources in collaboration with experts
   on the crops in question. The datasets were validated by experts and by
   comparison with literature. Field emissions were calculated using a set
   of models taking into account situation-specific parameters. Data
   defined by this procedure are more generally usable, bur their
   definition is also more laborious.
   Results and Discussion. Selected results (inventories and impact
   assessment) are presented for infrastructure (buildings, machinery),
   work processes, fertilisers, pesticides, seed and arable crop products.
   Infrastructure has a higher share of environmental impacts than in
   typical industrial processes, often due to low utilisation rates. Energy
   use is dominated by mechanisation, the use of mineral fertilisers
   (particularly nitrogen) and grain drying. Eutrophication is caused
   mainly by nitrogen compounds. In general, field emissions are of
   decisive importance for many environmental impacts.
   Conclusion and Outlook. The ecoinvent database provides representative
   agricultural data for the Swiss, and to an extent, the European context.
   It also provides the meta-information necessary for deciding whether a
   dataset is suitable for the purpose of a particular LCA study. To
   further improve the representativeness of the datasets, an environmental
   farm monitoring network is required.},

Title = {The development of an integrated BIM-based visual demolition waste
   management planning system for sustainability-oriented decision-making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In light of the suboptimal resource efficiency persisting in current
   demolition waste management (DWM) practices caused by inattentive and
   profit-driven decision-making due to the lack of tailored stringent
   legislation, monetary incentives, and benchmarking frameworks, this
   study aims to facilitate sustainability-oriented decision-making at the
   demolition planning stage. A practical Building Information Modelling
   (BIM)-based visual DWM planning system is designed, wherein the system
   seamlessly accommodates inventory analysis and Multi-Criteria
   Decision-Aiding (MCDA) algorithms into various interconnected modules.
   Moreover, this research proposes bespoke algorithms and colour coding
   schemes to quantify and visualise the recycling value of building
   components for augmenting the visual guidance of sustainable building
   design and selective demolition planning.Furthermore, a pilot case study
   demonstrates the system's applicability in a real-world demolition
   project. The findings unveil that improving the recycling rate
   substantially offsets carbon emissions and demolition waste disposal
   expenditures. The increment in beneficial impacts outweighs the
   additional energy consumption and costs for implementing sustainable DWM
   strategies based on the predefined geographical settings. This BIM-based
   system reforms the conventional demolition planning and DWM
   decision-making workflow by tackling technical barriers concerning data
   richness, interoperability, and result interpretation. It equips the
   users with intuitive visual design guidance and parallel scenario
   analysis when crafting sustainability-oriented DWM schemes. In summary,
   this research contributes to familiarising industry practitioners with
   sustainable DWM schematic design and circular economy principles.
   Moreover, it prompts the development of customised BIM libraries as
   repositories for updating and capitalising on DWM-related information
   that can be adapted to different regional contexts.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a design-build-operate energy information modelling
   (DBO-EIM) infrastructure to allow users to deploy the design-stage
   building energy model for model predictive control (MPC) system in the
   building operation. A newly constructed office building is studied as a
   test bed. An EnergyPlus model-based predictive control (EPMPC) system is
   designed and simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment within the
   DBO-EIM infrastructure. EPMPC aims at minimizing heating, ventilation,
   and air conditioning energy consumption while maintaining occupant
   thermal comfort. Compared to the baseline rule-based control system,
   EPMPC demonstrates a 28.9\% energy reduction in one-week simulation in
   the heating season and 2.7\% energy reduction in one-week simulation in
   the cooling season. The comfort constraint is met during more than 90\%
   of the simulated hours. The study demonstrates one significant
   contribution of the DBO-EIM infrastructure that a design-stage
   EnergyPlus model can be integrated in an MPC system and the preliminary
   simulation results are satisfactory.},

Abstract = {According to the European Union report, 40\% of the total energy was
   consumed in the building sector. Over 80\% of energy was consumed during
   building's operational stage. In addition, energy embodied in
   construction materials is also huge, e.g., producing cement is an
   energy-intensive process. Therefore, a proper building design help
   reduce building's environmental impact during its lifecycle. Due to the
   uncertainty of the relationship between individual design parameters and
   building performance, the extent of impact cannot be well-understood. In
   this study, main design parameters that affect the building performance
   are analyzed based on a BIM platform. Simulation of energy consumption
   is run for different scenarios in terms of operational energy
   consumption. Energy embodied in typical construction materials are
   calculated for each scenario. Sensitivity analysis is applied to find
   the extent of impact for the selected design parameters in terms of both
   operational and embodied energy. It is found that although the material
   of windows have highest energy coefficient, windows are the most
   energy-efficient and important parameter to be considered in term of
   life cycle energy consumption.},

   environmental impact data, their interaction with the underlying
   datasets presents an opportunity to evaluate building materials through
   an environmental justice (EJ) lens. This proof-of-concept method
   demonstrates the potential importance in reviewing environmental impact
   data for the local impacts, such as Photochemical Ozone Creation
   Potential (POCP). When the method is applied to a building project case
   study, an identical product manufactured at two or more sites is shown
   to have vastly different impacts on the local communities, illustrating
   the need for a closer look at manufacturer-provided environmental impact

Abstract = {Projects in the construction industry involve multidisciplinary
   collaboration between the disciplines of architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC), and others. Conventionally, the collaboration
   between these disciplines relied on the recurrent exchange of relevant
   drawings and documents. Building information modeling (BIM) as a
   model-based process has given AEC professionals the tools to more
   efficiently plan, design, construct, and manage buildings and
   infrastructure. Yet the AEC industry has been reluctant in fully
   adopting the BIM as a single standard. This study explores and
   identifies the bottlenecks in adopting BIM as a single product lifecycle
   standard in the construction industry and advise on educating new
   engineers to become the generation to use a virtual collaborative
   working space covering the entire building lifecycle. Two conducted
   surveys targeting the AEC academia and industry revealed the needs for
   multilevel cross-disciplinary interactive collaborative BIM process
   modeling, and skilled workforce to increase the graduates' marketability
   and BIM adaptability. It is concluded that the new age collaborative
   culture requires new generation of AEC players that are enabled to work
   on a shared virtual product model supported by proactive BIM skills
   learned through undergraduate programs.},

Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO)
   industry is generally slow in adopting emerging technologies, and such
   hesitance invariably restricts performance improvements. A plethora of
   studies have focused on the barriers, Critical Success Factors (CSFs),
   lifecycle and drivers independently, but none have explored the impact
   of BIM drivers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study
   empirically explored the impact of BIM drivers and awareness on the
   project lifecycle using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Initially,
   a conceptual model was developed from an extensive literature review.
   Thereafter, the model was tested using primary questionnaire data
   obtained from 90 construction professionals in Lagos, Nigeria. Emergent
   findings indicate that Building Information Modelling (BIM) drivers have
   a high impact on BIM awareness at the operation stage of the project
   lifecycle. The SEM model has an average R-2 value of 23\% which is
   moderate. Consequently, this research contributes to the existing body
   of knowledge by providing invaluable insight into the impact of BIM
   drivers on BIM awareness in the project lifecycle. Knowledge acquired
   will help industry stakeholders and government to develop appropriate
   policies to increase BIM uptake within contemporary practice.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {This article addresses the utmost upstream impacts of human building
   energy interaction by proposing a network-based model, algorithms, and
   indicators. Hypothesizing that human behavior is a key factor for the
   symbiotic development of building and the geobiosphere system, the
   author seeks emergy (spelled with an ``m{''}) information integrated
   measures to indicate dynamic system-level performance of the interaction
   with building energy flow topology. To validate the hypothesis and
   methods, four representative building cases were tested on the building
   form (envelope) of (i) a building with no occupant intervention
   (baseline), (ii) a building controlled by responsive human behavior
   (bioclimatic adaptation), (iii) a building with reinforced insulation
   and behavior dominated control (passive design), and (iv) a net-zero
   energy building (NZEB). The results demonstrate that adaptive human
   behavior in building operation increases the information content and
   complexity of energy-flow networking, improving performance and
   sustainability. Findings also reveal that increasing information,
   complexity, and power (energy availability over time) parallel the
   general energetic features of developing biophysical systems (greater
   feedback, internalization, and recycling of materials and energies). It
   becames clear that active behavioral response is a dominant agent of
   sustainable environments even on a far broader system scale.},

Title = {A BIM-Based construction and demolition waste information management
   system for greenhouse gas quantification and reduction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {229},
Pages = {308-324},

Abstract = {Excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have caused serious global
   warming and climate change. As the construction and demolition waste
   (CDW) end of life disposal process is a source of GHG emissions, it is
   vital to precisely estimate and reduce CDW end of life GHG emissions.
   The precise estimation of CDW information is essential for GHG
   estimation and reduction. However, as current CDW information and
   associated GHG estimation methods tend to be inaccurate, in this paper,
   a building information modeling (BIM)-based CDW information management
   system (IMS) is constructed that provides precise CDW information and a
   detailed information estimation process. To facilitate the accurate
   quantification of CDW disposal GHG emissions, mathematical formulae that
   include several GHG emission factors are proposed. A practical case
   study from China is then given to demonstrate the efficiency and
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology in quantifying and reducing
   CDW disposal GHG emissions. Accurate GHG emission estimation are
   determined for fifteen CDW disposal types and a comparison are
   conducted. Concrete was found to have the highest carbon dioxide,
   methane, and nitrous oxide emissions during transportation and the
   highest carbon dioxide emissions during handling, and organics were
   found to have the highest decomposition methane emissions. Targeted
   suggestions are given for source-separated CDW disposal GHG emission
   reduction based on the different emission characteristics. The
   combination of the BIM -based CDW IMS and the developed mathematical
   formulae were found to efficiently and accurately determine the CDW
   information and the associated GHG emissions, and therefore provide a
   practical guide to reducing the serious environmental damage generated
   by CDW disposal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {European shipbuilders are facing a strong, worldwide competition.
   Consequently they have to reinvent their market approach and expand
   their business. In the past, European shipbuilders were focused on cost
   reduction in the production process to offer new build vessels at a
   competitive price for decades. Changing the focus from the selling price
   optimisation to the life cycle cost optimisation could lead to
   competitive advantages and enable new business opportunities. This new
   approach of through-life asset management is investigated in the
   EU-funded project ThroughLife. The minimisation of a vessel's life cycle
   costs could be realised by applying new and innovative technologies.
   However, new technologies are characterised by higher investment costs
   and uncertainty regarding functionality, reliability and reparability.
   As a result, the situation can be characterised as a dilemma for the new
   building yard the ship owner and the repair yard. Therefore the
   ThroughLife project focuses besides the development of new technologies
   on the identification, elaboration and application of new business model
   concepts to overcome this dilemma. One business model concept is the
   offer of a comprehensive service package against a fixed, time based
   fee, which would lead to an overall cost reduction due to economies of
   scale, lower administration costs and a risk reduction for the customer,
   which would support the market penetration of new technologies.
   Combining this business model approach with the technology of monitoring
   sensors increases the potential of this approach. The service provider
   could use the gathered information to schedule maintenance according to
   the actual condition of the vessel and identify potential mistreatment
   by the client. The customer would benefit from reduced, calculable costs
   and a lower risk level when applying new technologies. Further research
   contains lifecycle cost model calculations as well as real-life tests of
   the monitoring hardware in order to proof the concept. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {The need to reduce energy consumption in buildings is clearly recognised
   as a necessary contribution to the minimisation of greenhouse gas
   emissions. To complement the focus on the energy performance of
   individual buildings, this paper suggests additional approaches which
   include life cycle energy analysis in combination with urban energy
   mapping techniques. Commencing with an overview of energy consumption in
   the built environment, the paper draws attention to other components of
   urban energy consumption such as the embodied energy of buildings and
   infrastructure. The different approaches to modifying energy usage are
   placed in the context of scale in the built environment and complexity
   of urban energy improvements. Recent attempts to influence energy
   consumption patterns across this scale are referred to by using the city
   of Adelaide in South Australia as an example. Some research projects are
   described which take a range of approaches to modelling energy usage in
   buildings. These offer potential for analysing changes to overall energy
   consumption such as the retrofitting of buildings, selection of
   alternative dwelling forms and the design of urban redevelopments.},

Title = {Service-oriented semantic enrichment of indoor point clouds using
   octree-based multiview classification},
Journal = {GRAPHICAL MODELS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {105},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for Facility Management
   (FM) in the Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) stages of the building
   life-cycle is intended to bridge the gap between operations and digital
   data, but lacks the functionality of assessing the state of the built
   environment due to non-automated generation of associated semantics. 3D
   point clouds can be used to capture the physical state of the built
   environment, but also lack these associated semantics. A prototypical
   implementation of a service-oriented architecture for classification of
   indoor point cloud scenes of office environments is presented, using
   multiview classification. The multiview classification approach is
   tested using a retrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model -
   Inception V3. The presented approach for classifying common office
   furniture objects (chairs, sofas and desks), contained in 3D point cloud
   scans, is tested and evaluated. The results show that the presented
   approach can classify common office furniture up to an acceptable degree
   of accuracy, and is suitable for quick and robust semantics
   approximation - based on RGB (red, green and blue color channel) cubemap
   images of the octree partitioned areas of the 3D point cloud scan.
   Additional methods for web-based 3D visualization, editing and
   annotation of point clouds are also discussed. Using the described
   approach, captured scans of indoor environments can be semantically
   enriched using object annotations derived from multiview classification
   results. Furthermore, the presented approach is suited for semantic
   enrichment of lower resolution indoor point clouds acquired using
   commodity mobile devices.},

Title = {A BIM-Based Framework for Managing Handover Information Loss},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The construction project information for FM team control and maintenance
   is vital. However, current practices indicate significant data drops
   during the handover stage, leading to rework during FM systems
   integration of inaccurate, delivered information. Although challenges in
   BIM implementation are well studied, there is a current lack of best
   practices from FM industry experts highlighting challenges with a
   specific focus on the areas of the data drop. Therefore, the aim is to
   develop a framework that can reduce data loss and improve data
   management. The objectives include robust literature review on
   challenges of information loss during handover phase, management and
   frameworks; Adopting case study and workshops to identify information
   loss challenges, framework development and validation with industry
   experts. This paper adopted a grounded theory approach to explore
   literature and conducted case studies, including a series of
   semistructured interviews and a workshop with FM industry experts. The
   findings show the areas and causes of information loss and how to manage
   them through the developed information loss management framework (ILMF).
   With the start of any type of project, planning and establishing rules
   from the beginning facilitates the smooth transition between different
   phases. Similarly, in construction projects, this research provides
   guidelines on how facility managers can manage information loss when
   exchanged through projects' stages. Furthermore, with the continuing
   advancements in the construction world, the facility management should
   be equipped with management and leadership guidelines as presented in
   the proposed framework to reduce data loss during handover. However,
   there are cost and contractual issues that prohibit any involvement of
   the facility manager in early project stages. The results of this study
   provide an identification of professional practices do's and do not's
   that facilitate the management and development of projects with the
   support of the latest technologies in the market. Ultimately, developing
   a guide that adapts international standards. The study's contribution to
   knowledge includes the development of a new information loss management
   framework that adopts BIM and ISO standards after exploring the existing
   data management frameworks in the literature that lack data loss
   management as a focus. The framework works as a guide for various
   stakeholders such as designers, contractors with a focus on FM to
   facilitates data coordination and management to reduce information loss,
   its creation and validation were conducted in collaboration with
   industry experts. Furthermore, its novelty lies in integrating FM role,
   information management, information loss, address project life cycle,
   and adopts the ISO 19650 series.},

Abstract = {During its life cycle a building structure is exposed to many various
   external influences which could lead to changes, damages in different
   dimensions or signs of wear related to a decrease of functionality.
   Continuous monitoring and survey of the structure using conventional
   inspections by special trained engineers are supported by modern
   technology as sensor networks or laser scanning keep the costs for
   reconstructions as small as possible. The collected data and the applied
   analysis methods are able to allow a precise assessment of buildings.
   The integration of standard analysis processes could accelerate the
   evaluation process additionally. Combining the building model and the
   related or integrated survey data a complete basis for inspection
   documentation would be provided. In this article, a workflow for the
   modeling of data analyses, management and automated evaluation for
   building condition assessment linked to building information models is
   proposed. In a practical case study, the workflow is applied in order to
   obtain structural evaluations based on the processing of survey raw
   data. As test case an implementation shows the application of the
   developed concepts for a concrete beam during a three-point bending
   test.},

Title = {HBIM for storing life-cycle data regarding decay and damage in existing
   timber structures},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The conservation and maintenance of the historical heritage is an issue
   of great importance, especially when dealing with elements that can
   easily suffer damage along the time, either to intrinsic materials
   properties or by exposure conditions, like often happen for timber
   structures. For the management and maintenance of historic timber
   structures, HBIM (Historic Building Information Modeling) is here
   presented as a fundamental tool. This work presents the application of a
   methodology that uses common HBIM software in combination with results
   obtained from non-destructive testing and geometric surveying, allowing
   it to perform modeling, analysis and storage of geometric data, levels
   of decay and lack of material of timber structures within a
   tridimensional space. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates
   different time stages, thus allowing to make periodic comparisons along
   time, that substantiate a decision making process to take decisions
   about maintenance and intervention actions. In this work two case
   studies are used to validate this methodology and present its possible
   use. The case studies are: (i) the timber structure of the roof of the
   key tower of the Castle of Guimaraes, and (ii) the timber structure of
   the ceiling and roof of the room of the Knight's Room in the Convent of
   Christ, Tomar, both Portuguese buildings listed as UNESCO World Heritage
   Sites.},

Title = {Scientometric analysis of BIM-based research in construction engineering
   and management},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {1750-1776},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to summarize the latest research of
   BIM adoption in construction engineering and management (CEM) and
   propose research directions for future scholarly work. During the recent
   decade, building information modeling (BIM) has gained increasing
   applications and research interest in the construction industry.
   Although there have been review-based studies that summarized BIM-based
   research in the overall architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   area, there is limited review that evaluates the current stage of
   BIM-based research specifically in the CEM sub-area.
   Design/methodology/approach CEM falls into the scope of AEC. It involves
   construction-related tasks, activities and processes (e.g. scheduling
   and cost estimates), issues (e.g. constructability), as well as human
   factors (e.g. collaboration). This study adopted a holistic literature
   review approach that incorporates bibliometric search and scientometric
   analysis. A total of 276 articles related to BIM applied in CEM were
   selected from Scopus as the literature sample for the scientometric
   analysis. Findings Some key CEM research areas (e.g. CEM pedagogy,
   integrated project delivery, lean and off-site construction) were
   identified and evaluated. Research trends in these areas were
   identified, and analyses were carried out with regard to how they could
   be integrated with BIM. For example, BIM, as a data repository for ACE
   facilities, has substantial potential to be integrated with a variety of
   other digital technologies, project delivery methods and innovative
   construction techniques throughout the whole process of CEM. Practical
   implications - As BIM is one of the key technologies and digital
   platforms to improve the construction productivity and collaboration, it
   is important for industry practitioners to be updated of the latest
   movement and progress of the academic research. The industry, academics
   and governmental authorities should work with joint effort to fill the
   gap by first recognizing the current needs, limitations and trends of
   applying BIM in the construction industry. For example, it needs more
   understanding about how to address technical interoperability issues and
   how to introduce the integrated design and construction delivery
   approach for BIM implementation under the UK BIM Level 2/3 framework.
   Originality/value This study contributed to the body of knowledge in BIM
   by proposing a framework leading to research directions including the
   differences of BIM effects between design-bid-build and other fast-track
   project delivery methods; the integration of BIM with off-site
   construction; and BIM pedagogy in CEM. It also addressed the need to
   investigate the similarities and differences between academia and
   industry toward perceiving the movement of BIM in construction field
   work.},

Abstract = {A need exists for robust environmental and health-related information to
   support decisions about construction products and the design of new
   construction and refurbishment projects. This need arises in order to
   protect resources and the natural environment. The relevant information
   can be provided from, for example, a life cycle assessment in the form
   of impact indicators. However, the large, complex data can overburden
   individual actors in construction and property (real estate). Hence, the
   question arises as to whether and how the complexity of communicating
   environmental information for construction products can be simplified.
   This paper explores various approaches to grouping the different impact
   indicators and to determining proxy indicators and impact indices as
   single scores within these indicator groups. No appropriate single proxy
   indicator is appropriate for all impact indicators. However, a cluster
   of indicators can be formed and proxy indicators or impact indices can
   be determined within these groups. An application of the approaches to
   the impact indicators according to the currently discussed product
   environmental footprint approach is presented. With a series of single
   scores, an existing multi-criteria decision problem can be reduced and a
   basis for business-to-consumer communication can be formed.},

Title = {Adoption and implementation of BIM - case study of a Saudi Arabian AEC
   firm},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {608-624},
Abstract = {Purpose The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) technology
   in the global architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industries is steadily increasing. However, developing countries such as
   Saudi Arabia are still lagging behind. The purpose of this paper is to
   present a framework for BIM adoption in the AEC industry in Saudi Arabia
   through a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a two-pronged approach.
   First, the various stages, benefits and challenges of BIM implementation
   in a local AEC firm's pilot project were documented. Then, a BIM
   maturity measurement of the pilot project was conducted, and
   identification of the areas where improvements can be made.
   Findings BIM implementation provided several benefits and efficiency
   gains. These include a faster design processes, effective reuse of
   information and overall client satisfaction. Challenges faced include a
   lack of interest by clients and industry stakeholders, inadequate
   experience of the BIM team, and lack of mentorship from a BIM champion.
   The findings of the BIM maturity measurement were presented as an
   implementation framework in the five process areas and ten subject areas
   of the Project Management Institute's (PMI) project management
   framework.
   Originality/value Though, frameworks, guidelines and protocols have been
   developed to facilitate the successful adoption of BIM, the issue is not
   a case of one size fits all. This study thus introduces the much needed
   awareness in the research and professional domain in Saudi Arabia. It
   also presents the proposed framework in the PMI framework, which is an
   incremental innovation to previous work.},

Abstract = {With the increasing importance of the sustainable product development of
   the building materials for the sustainable building and its industries,
   this study structured the existing sustainability assessment methods
   based on a common information structure, which was classified by its
   categories, aspects, and indicators. Sustainability indicator lists were
   structured into 25 categories, 88 aspects which 25\% of those were
   product or product and regional related ones. Most of the sorted
   indicators related to products were difficult to be applied at the early
   phase of product development due to the lack of required level of
   information. Meanwhile, the indicators could be a supportive tool for
   the later phase of product development, for the production planning step
   as an example. Since the regional conditions showed the link between the
   sustainability performance during the building's operational phase, the
   conditions may serve as a proxy information to guide during the earlier
   product development phase. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   industry domains over the life cycle of a building project. The IFCs are
   common object classes that represent information about the project and
   are used to construct project models. The models are shared by the
   computer applications used by the project participants to facilitate
   communication through a commonly understood language defined in the
   models. This paper discusses detailed topics about the IFC models such
   as the model types, architecture, and model elements. It explains the
   IAI's procedures for the development of the IFCs. Important issues such
   as model integration and modeling techniques are addressed. In addition,

   Different Climatic Zones of China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The building envelope plays a significant role in the energy performance
   of buildings and windows are a key element in transmitting heating and
   cooling between the indoor and outdoor environment, and hence an
   adequate window system is one of the most important retrofit strategies
   of existing buildings for energy conservation. Therefore, this study
   presents a method with a theoretical case study to examine the
   improvement of energy efficiency in a typical high-rise residential
   building through window retrofitting. A building energy design model in
   Designbuilder along with a building information modeling (BIM) model in
   Revit are developed, with 20 common potential glazing alternatives being
   analyzed to predict the potential energy savings in the same case
   building with identical orientation located in a variety of climate
   zones in China. Based on different parameters and considerations, the
   results demonstrated that the currently relatively expensive low-e
   window glazing has the best energy performance in all climate zones, but
   is sufficiently close to conventionally glazed windows in its energy
   efficiency to discourage its adoption at present, and that, instead, a
   single dark conventional glazed window is preferred in a hot summer/warm
   winter climate, double dark traditional glazing in a hot summer/cold
   winter climate, and a double clear conventional window in a cold
   climate. Based on the simulated results, an indicative suggestion was
   provided to select an adequate window system for residential building
   retrofitting in the studied climates or similar climatic regions.},

Abstract = {In the past, knowledge in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industries mainly come from experiences and are
   documented in hard copies or specific electronic databases. In order to
   make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving
   and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable
   media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional
   digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the
   project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM
   shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of
   the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes
   the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in
   the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3)
   knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5)
   knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future
   directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in
   the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable
   of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by
   adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related
   methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the
   design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC
   industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

Abstract = {Energy saving is crucial for existing buildings which is present a huge
   potential of improvement by a strong energy retrofitting. Often, the
   existing envelope components are not adequately insulated and deep
   refurbishment is required to comply current regulations to improve
   energy efficiency and address Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) goals.
   The strategies to enhance buildings energy performance involve heating
   and cooling demands strongly dependent by envelope quality (i.e.
   insulation, thermal mass, internal gain storage capacity and solar heat
   gains exploitation). Commonly, the suggested main retrofit interventions
   on envelope are glazed surfaces replacement, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient
   (SHGC) reduction and thermal transmittance (U value) improvement by
   additional insulation layers or even components replacement. However, it
   is worthy to note that the resulting thickness of the external envelope
   and the payback time of the interventions are important supports for
   decision-making. The environmental issue related to CO2 emissions during
   the operational phase of the building is encompassed into the standard
   energy certification of the asset and the conversion factors to define
   fuels' impacts are available and updated. However, the calculation
   excludes the environmental impact due to energy used for materials'
   production and few official information sources provide accredited
   values, e.g. the Environmental Product Declaration (EPC). Going towards
   a Zero Energy Building, which reduces its environmental impact during
   the running phase, embodied energy claims an increasing weight. Thus,
   materials and components with low embodied energy should be favoured and
   endorsed. For this reason, the most influential rating systems worldwide
   available for building sustainability assessment (e.g. LEED, BREEAM,
   etc.) updated their checklists including criteria related to reduced
   energy for extraction, production and materials transportation on the
   field.
   The technological optioneering of envelope solutions to achieve both
   energy efficiency and economic affordability is inevitably based on and
   supported by multicriteria assessment frameworks. These frameworks
   should include energy, environmental and economic parameters to define
   the technological suitability in different climate conditions
   identifying accurate optimization points, e.g. thickness of the
   insulation layer or heat storage capacity, considering energy saving and
   management costs in the life cycle. When actual optimization processes
   are required, computational parametric tools support to ease the
   options' performance comparison and to compute different combinations.
   Nowadays some tools are available into the main authoring software on
   the energy simulation market. Although different tools could be adopted,
   the need of transparency and custom workflows is crucial. In the present
   research, a specific multi-criteria methodological approach enables to
   outline a synoptic diagram for each considered climate to compare the
   envelope technological solutions by aggregating LCA (Life Cycle
   Analysis) and LCC (Life Cycle Cost) factors. For LCA, Embodied Energy
   (EE) of the envelope materials and Primary Energy (EP) used during the
   running phase have been considered. For LCC Investment Cost (C) of the
   materials to enhance a baseline performance and related operational
   costs of the building based on Net Present Value (NPV) and Discounted
   Payback Period (DPP) have been adopted. The present study focuses as
   first on the construction coherency of different technologies used to
   define the external envelope of a test room, able to manage the energy
   flows resulting from different external conditions. Subsequently the
   definition of the technological basket, a parametric analysis based on
   reducing thermal losses and increase solar gains has been performed
   defining the most suitable technologies and facade configuration in
   three representative climate conditions at national level by calculating
   heating and cooling demand and related primary energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of house renovation, which is often
   necessary to improve the value of human existence. The new space-use
   requirements demanded by new life-styles and changes in family living
   needs require creating renovation projects, the feasibility of which
   should be properly assessed. The information about house construction
   elements required for verifying a project is derived from an IFC file of
   a building. In order to select and process multiple building elements a
   dedicated IFC browser application has been developed. This application
   improves the workflow of the renovation projects and makes accessing
   relevant information fast and easy. The presented approach is
   illustrated by an example of changing the spatial arrangement in a
   single-family house.},

Title = {CO<sub>2</sub>Emission Calculation Method during Construction Process
   for Developing BIM-Based Performance Evaluation System},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Nowadays, global warming is a big challenge for human beings; since the
   Kyoto Protocol became effective, greenhouse gas emissions have been an
   important environmental evaluation index in all industries. Construction
   is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas
   emissions in the construction stage are mainly from the construction
   materials and the construction activities. The purpose of this paper is
   to quantitatively calculate the carbon dioxide emissions in the
   construction process, and provide a method of controlling the
   CO(2)emissions effectively by converting into cost. In this study, the
   authors selected the tunnel construction as the research object, and
   chose the primary greenhouse gas-CO(2)to estimate emissions. The authors
   did a research based on BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology,
   to calculate CO(2)emission during the construction process. It
   considered the CO(2)emissions from main materials and equipment.
   Finally, the authors used the recent carbon emission trading price to
   convert the CO(2)emission into cost, and did the economic analysis. The
   method proposed in this paper can effectively evaluate the
   CO(2)emissions in the construction process; it has a good reference
   significance for the selection of low-carbon emission materials in the
   design process, and it provides a case reference and direction for
   research of low-carbon equipment. By using the EU emissions trading
   system, the economic conversion of CO(2)emissions will provide an
   economic evaluation index for the CO(2)emissions of tunnel construction
   activities. Meanwhile, based on the method of this study, a BIM-based
   automated performance evaluation system could be developed.},

Journal = {DECISION ANALYSIS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {A key decision in infrastructure management is the allocation of
   resources to maintenance activities that consist of periodic
   rehabilitation actions and routine day-to-day operations. These
   activities improve the quality of different assets and operations. They
   also differ in terms of their objectives, costs, and life-cycle
   characteristics; yet they all impact the same infrastructure system and
   compete for resources from the same budget. To support the allocation of
   resources to these activities, we present a generic resource allocation
   model that we developed for the Finnish Road Administration (Finnra) by
   building and interlinking (i) a preference model, which yields the
   aggregate value of maintenance activities by applying multiattribute
   value functions to the quality distributions, of assets; (ii) a
   life-cycle model, which captures the deterioration-improvement dynamics
   associated with the maintenance activities; and (iii) an optimization
   model, which generates funding recommendations for maximizing the
   aggregate long-term value of maintenance investments. The optimization
   results were explored in facilitated workshops where ``on-the-fly{''}
   computations gave senior managers insights into how the recommendations
   depended on preferences and budget levels. The case study was awarded
   for an outstanding achievement in Finnra's research program, and it was
   also recognized as a Finalist for the Decision Analysis Society Practice
   Award in 2007.},

   information modeling. The use-cases identified and exemplarily described
   from BMVI for infrastructural buildings have to be developed,
   concretized and further amended with respect to the subject area.
   Regarding the specialized model ``subsoil{''}, use-cases are defined
   which can directly be implemented. The specialized model delivers the
   necessary data or a derivative out of this (geological section) for
   execution of the use-cases. For practical projects, the client selects
   the use-cases out of a catalogue with standardized use-cases which
   become part of the Client Information Request (AIA). In this context,

Title = {Assessing Land Use Efficiencies and Land Quality Impacts of Renewable
   Transportation Energy Systems for Passenger Cars Using the LANCA® Method},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Targets to reduce global warming impacts of the transportation sector
   may lead to increased land use and negative land quality changes. The
   aim of this paper is to implement the Land Use Indicator Calculation in
   Life Cycle Assessment (LANCA (R)) model to assess land quality impacts
   and land use efficiencies (concerning occupation and transformation) of
   different example renewable transport energy systems for passenger cars.
   In addition, the land use impacts are normalized according to the Soil
   Quality Index building on LANCA (R) and included in the environmental
   footprint. The assessment is based on information from GaBi life cycle
   assessment software databases and on literature. Functional unit of the
   model is to provide annual drive of 18,600 km for a passenger car in the
   EU. The analysis includes examples of biomass, electricity, electricity
   to fuels and fossil-based energy systems. Our findings confirm previous
   research that biomass-based transport energy systems have risks to lead
   to significantly higher land occupation and transformation impacts than
   do fossil oil or electricity-based ones. According to the LANCA (R)
   model, methane from Finnish wood and German corn has the highest impacts
   on filtration and the physicochemical filtration reduction potential.
   Sugarcane ethanol and palm oil diesel systems, on the other hand, lead
   to the highest erosion potential. Electricity-based transportation
   energy systems appear to be superior to biomassbased ones from the
   perspectives of land occupation, land transformation, and soil quality
   impacts for the selected examples. Land quality impacts should be taken
   into account when developing and expanding renewable transportation
   energy systems. The paper shows that the LANCA (R) method is applicable
   for the assessment of transport systems in order to provide extended
   information on environmental sustainability, which should be included
   more often in future analysis. However, it can be challenging to
   interpret underlaying assumptions, especially when aggregated
   information is used from databases.},

Abstract = {Construction industry contributes a large portion of waste to landfill,
   which in turns results in environmental pollution and CO2 emission.
   Despite the adoption of several waste management strategies, waste
   reduction to landfill continues seeming an insurmountable challenge.
   This paper explores factors impeding the effectiveness of existing waste
   management strategies, as well as strategies for reducing waste
   intensiveness of the construction industry. Drawing on series of semi
   structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading
   construction companies, this paper combines phenomenological approach
   with a critical review and analysis of extant literatures.
   Five broad categories of factors and practices are responsible for
   ineffectiveness of construction and demolition waste management
   strategies, which subsequently results in waste intensiveness of the
   industry. These include end of pipe treatment of waste, externality and
   incompatibility of waste management tools with design tools, atomism of
   waste management strategies, perceived or unexpected high cost of waste
   management, and culture of waste behaviour within the industry. To
   reduce waste intensiveness of the construction industry, the study
   suggests that six factors are requisites. These are tackling of waste at
   design stage, whole life waste consideration; compliance of waste
   management solutions with BIM, cheaper cost of waste management
   practice, increased stringency of waste management legislation and
   fiscal policies, and research and enlightenment. The proposed strategies
   are not only important for achieving low waste construction projects,
   they are important for reducing waste intensiveness of the construction.
   Implementation of the suggested measures would drive waste management
   practices within the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors that drive
   highway construction companies to adopt smart construction technologies.
   Using expert interviews and expert scoring, we collected interview data
   from 25 experts in the field and we proposed the TOSE framework based on
   the TOE framework, identifying four dimensions and fourteen influencing
   factors. We analyzed the results using the Fuzzy DEMATEL-ISM method, and
   we then summarized the findings according to the evaluation criteria to
   determine the validity of the fourteen hypotheses and the extent to
   which they drive highway construction companies to adopt smart
   construction technologies. The findings of this paper are of high value
   to decision makers and participants in highway construction companies,
   as well as to other companies in the construction industry, in their

Title = {The Evolution of Knowledge and Trends within the Building Energy
   Efficiency Field of Knowledge},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The building sector is responsible for 50\% of worldwide energy
   consumption and 40\% of CO2 emissions. Consequently, a lot of research
   on Building Energy Efficiency has been carried out over recent years,
   covering the most varied topics. While many of these themes are no
   longer of interest to the scientific community, others flourish. Thus,
   reading trends within a field of knowledge is wise since it allows
   resources to be directed towards the most promising topics. However,
   there is a paucity of research on trend analysis in this field.
   Therefore, this article aims to analyse the evolution of the Building
   Energy Efficiency field of knowledge, identifying the recurrent themes
   and pointing out their trends, supported by statistical methods. Such an
   analysis relied on more than 9000 authors' keywords collected from 2000
   articles from the Scopus database and classified into 30 topics/themes.
   A frequency distribution of these themes enabled us to distinguish those
   most published as well as those whose academic interest has cooled down.
   This field of knowledge has evolved over three distinct phases,
   throughout which, eight themes presented an upward trend. These findings
   can assist researchers in optimising time and resources, investigating
   the topics with growing interest, and possibilities for new
   contributions.},

Title = {A framework for integrating embodied carbon assessment and construction
   feasibility in prefabricated stations},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {132},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With underground increasingly used for accommodating infrastructure and
   transport networks, construction sustainability throughout the life
   cycle of projects attracts growing attention. Specifically, to achieve
   decar-bonisation goals, there are two types of strategy in the early
   design and construction stages: optimising material usage and designing
   with low-carbon materials to build clever, and utilising low-carbon
   construction technol-ogies and minimising waste to build efficiency.
   Integrated solutions that consider environmental impact and construction
   feasibility become increasingly important. This paper incorporates
   building information modelling (BIM) to evaluate Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
   emissions and construction practicality while enabling design
   adap-tation. A solution for adaptive designs of underground stations
   with variable geometries is achieved, which collectively explores carbon
   accounting and construction viability. Under the emerging contemporary
   design and modular construction approach, a multiple level-of-details
   (multi-LoD) prefabricated station is developed to verify the proposed
   framework. We focus on calculating embodied carbon of the prefabricated
   station at the product and construction stages according to EN
   15978:2011. Then, automatic quantity take-off of all elements presented
   in the model is achieved by enabling data/parameter assignments and
   processing in BIM via visual programming. Five parametric adaptions with
   a fixed width are made to compare the contribution proportion of
   components to carbon emission. The difference in carbon footprint
   contributed by changing the steel rein-forcement ratio is the highest.
   Two use cases were further evaluated for construction feasibility and
   investigation of the beneficial potential of the integrated solution for
   large-scale metro network expansion. The first case verifies the
   interoperability between the multi-LoD BIM model and numerical modelling
   for a station at the construction stage with known ground conditions.
   The second case demonstrates the on-site BIM-based con-struction
   simulation with selected carbon solution for a station on a planned
   metro line. This paper explores the implementation of information
   modelling and enhances interoperability for the planning and
   construction of sustainable underground infrastructure.},

Title = {Computational screening-LCA tools for early design stages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-22},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and
   determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
   emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in
   the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means
   to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical
   LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and
   material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the
   conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined.
   In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation
   where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open
   to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this
   through a strict division into support and infill systems and a
   simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox
   approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in
   our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout,
   whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing
   total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the
   assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation
   process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical
   properties of each building component across the floor plan. The
   presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural
   systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global
   Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization
   output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a
   case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material
   choice and construction systems.},

Title = {Sustainability of underground infrastructure - Part 1:
   Digitalisation-based carbon assessment and baseline for TBM tunnelling},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Alongside the transition towards sustainable and renewable
   infrastructure and energy production, tunnelling projects that adopt
   tunnel boring machines (TBM) continue to increase in size and
   complexity. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies have a significant
   impact on the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry,
   with a shift in focus to cost and carbon management across the
   infrastructure lifecycle through the use of digitalisation techniques
   and sustainability rating systems. This paper aims to develop a
   systematic framework to enhance the sustainability of underground
   infrastructure in the early design and construction stages, aiming for
   ``build clever and efficiently{''}. This framework integrates
   digitalisation, carbon assessment standards, numerical modelling, and
   optimisation techniques to assess carbon emissions and establish
   benchmarks for construction products and processes. The approach uses
   parametric models to define tunnelling-related entities such as
   geological formations, TBM, and segments, designed with dimensional
   constraints that allow for adaptive modelling and interactions. Enabled
   by building information modelling (BIM) through parametric models
   enriched with domain properties, module-based carbon accounting is
   adopted to evaluate the footprint of material- and asset-level key
   emitters with functional units. Leveraging established databases,
   baselines for segmental lining designs and carbon reduction strategies
   are established. Through project-driven case studies, the correlations
   among geotechnical conditions, tunnel dimensions, and TBM operating
   parameters are developed to quantify TBM carbon emissions. A prototype
   programme demonstrates the framework's application on typical metro and
   road tunnels at different levels of details (LoD). This paper serves as
   a guideline for conducting embodied carbon assessments specifically
   tailored to TBM tunnelling, acknowledging the substantial contribution
   of the TBM construction process, which is controlled by geotechnical
   conditions.},

Abstract = {In order to foster a more sustainable and eco-friendly trajectory for
   the construction industry, while concurrently mitigating environmental
   pollution and energy inefficiency, it is imperative to cultivate an
   environmentally conscious building and urban environment. Under the
   background of Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality, the green building

   the GBRS in weight setting, indicator setting, and the evaluation
   process, and creatively proposes the following three directions for
   future research: (1) Weight determination methods based on machine
   learning or deep learning models, and reasonable weight allocation by
   mixing multiple evaluation methods. (2) Setting dynamic evaluation
   indicators, strengthening interdisciplinary research and regional
   consideration, and introducing a life cycle assessment to solve the
   problem of setting indicators in the existing evaluation system. (3)
   Combine building information modeling with GBRS to realize the
   automation and intelligence of evaluation and improve the

Abstract = {This paper firstly presents the background of the research project aimed
   to: (i) building the formal models for representation of the product
   development context (entire body of data, information and engineering
   knowledge that evolves throughout the product development process); (ii)
   developing tools and methods for support of the product development
   context interoperability. After research introduction, review and
   systematization of the IT systems interoperability evolution are
   provided. Accordingly to the different computer and informational
   scientists' and experts' research results, different interoperability
   approaches are presented: custom coding, single standard, data
   warehouses, single systems, integration, and semantic-based information
   interoperability. In order to achieve the research goal, product
   development ontology harmonization is recognised as a main prerequisite
   for successful implementation of the newest computer technology and
   tools. The short overview on ontology definitions is provided. Different
   methodologies for building ontologies are summarized around tree major
   stages of the ontology life cycle i.e.,
   building-mampulating-maintaining. Finally, directions of the next
   research steps are proposed},

Title = {Implementing BIM on Infrastructure: Comparison of Two Bridge
   Construction Projects},
Journal = {PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research provides comparative analysis of the impacts and benefits
   associated with using building information modeling (BIM) on accelerated
   bridge construction in the Denver metropolitan area. To date, BIM
   remains a relatively underutilized tool in horizontal construction. BIM
   has the potential, however, to significantly increase efficiencies,
   minimize waste, and increase sustainability across infrastructure
   projects throughout their life cycles. This research studies the impacts
   of the first implementation of BIM processes on one of two structurally
   similar concurrent bridge construction projects by comparing metrics
   related to substructure costs, requests for information, change orders,
   rework, and schedule. Findings suggest that negative cost impacts of
   approximately 70\% may be associated with the first implementation of
   BIM during construction. However, additional findings suggest that the
   use of BIM may facilitate otherwise infeasible complex projects and
   reduce requests for information and change orders and has the potential
   to realize cost savings during follow-on projects. Specifically,
   findings from this case study suggest that BIM may have provided
   approximately 5-9\% cost savings during construction by contributing to
   reduced change orders and rework. Revealing such impacts and benefits
   associated with using BIM on transportation infrastructure construction
   begins to inform the industry and, in particular, organizations such as
   DOTs and urban transportation districts about potential opportunities
   related to BIM implementation. Additional and potentially significantly
   greater benefits may be realized through future BIM-enabled operation
   and maintenance of such infrastructure. This study provides a valuable
   first step in motivating the implementation of BIM within and throughout
   infrastructure asset management and motivates future research related to
   the use of BIM during infrastructure construction and operation. (C)

Title = {Assessing the Effectiveness of Building Information Modeling in
   Developing Green Buildings from a Lifecycle Perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technique in the
   construction industry. It is regarded as an effective approach for green
   building development; however, its effectiveness has not been
   sufficiently investigated from a lifecycle perspective. To bridge this
   research gap, this study investigates BIM application value in different
   phases of a green building through a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   method. To begin with, an assessment framework was developed with the
   consideration of balancing the estimation accuracy and the data size.
   Then, the validity of the developed model was verified from both
   theoretical and practical perspectives. Finally, the effectiveness of
   BIM was tested using the proposed framework. Results showed that the
   overall score of the tested project was four in the five-point Likert
   scale, with an average relative error less than 1\%. From a value-based
   perspective, it is revealed that the application value of BIM
   represented a descending order throughout the lifecycle of the tested
   project. In addition, it is found that the functional value obtained the
   highest score, whereas social value was at the bottom. The findings of
   this study can help decision makers to detect the weaknesses of BIM
   implementation during green building development.},

Abstract = {The industrial transformation led by digitization-related technologies
   has attracted research attention in recent decades, enhancing its
   application in different sectors. The transport industry is a crucial
   driving force for economic growth and social development. It is still
   necessary to make transportation infrastructure and services safer,
   cleaner, and more affordable to cope with increasing urbanization and
   mobility. This paper systematically examines the science mapping of
   building information modeling and digital twins technologies in the
   digitalization of transportation. Through the bibliometric and content
   analysis approaches, 493 related documents were screened and analyzed
   from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The software programs
   VOSviewer and Bibliometrix were used to determine research trends and
   current gaps, which will be beneficial to future research in this vital
   field. The results showed that over 80\% of the relevant documents have
   been published since 2018. China is the most productive country,
   followed by the United States and Italy, and Germany is the most cited
   and influential country. Moreover, research also revealed the leading
   authors, top journals, and highly cited papers. The findings may be used
   as a guide for: (1) improving the efficiency of intelligent
   transportation system element management; (2) the development and
   application of digital technologies; (3) the flow and goals of
   entire-life-cycle management; and (4) the optimization of related

Title = {Status quo and future directions of construction and demolition waste
   research: A critical review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Due to significant environmental, social, and economic impacts, the last
   decades have witnessed a rapid growth of research related to
   construction and demolition (C\&D) waste. By employing a systematic
   literature review approach, this study examined C\&D waste related
   articles published since the 1990s in order to explore future research
   directions. Results show the current C\&D waste research has been
   carried out from various perspectives. These mainly include
   environmental science and environmental engineering, material science
   and engineering, industrial ecology, management science, and
   architecture, engineering, construction and operation of buildings.
   Consequently, several future research opportunities are identified.
   These future research opportunities are: (1) identifying pollutants in
   C\&D waste derived from industrial buildings; (2) developing
   comprehensive pollutant control measures to treat C\&D waste; (3)
   improving the recyclability of C\&D waste; (4) developing the advanced
   performance evaluation criteria for wasted materials and recycled
   products; (5) extending the research boundary of C\&D waste flows; (6)
   understanding the dynamics and mobility during the life cycle of C\&D
   waste; (7) developing C\&D waste disposal charging system; (8)
   developing advanced methods to assess the C\&D waste management
   performance; (9) exploring the more efficient use of information
   technologies in C\&D waste management; (10) reducing C\&D waste from
   early project stages; and (11) reducing C\&D waste during the building
   operation. These findings are not only valuable to better understand the
   C\&D waste research, but also useful to assist practitioners to further
   improve C\&D waste management performance, and mitigate associated
   pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the main goals of the SYNAT project is to equip scientific
   community with a knowledge-based infrastructure providing fast access to
   relevant scientific information. We have started building an
   experimental platform where different kinds of stored knowledge will be
   modeled with the use of ontologies, e.g. reference/system ontology,
   domain ontologies and auxiliary knowledge including lexical language
   ontology layers. In our platform we use system ontology defining
   ``system domain{''} (a kind of meta knowledge) for the scientific
   community, covering concepts and activities related to the scientific
   life and domain ontologies dedicated to specific areas of science.
   Moreover the platform is supposed to-include a wide range of tools for
   building and maintenance of ontologies throughout their life cycle as
   well as interoperation among the different introduced ontologies.
   The paper makes a contribution to understanding semantically modeled
   knowledge and its incorporation into the SYNAT project. We present a
   review of ontology building, learning, and integration methods and their
   potential application in the project.},

Abstract = {This research provides a review of potential leadership qualities among
   building refurbishment project managers. The scope of work in
   rehabilitation projects is very different from that of new buildings
   projects. The key features associated with remodeling projects are
   unique, risky, highly complex and intrinsically full of uncertainties
   that are constant throughout the life cycle of the project. In addition,
   these projects have always been identified with the poor performance of
   the project that covers aspects of time, cost and quality. The objective
   of this study is to identify potential leadership qualities among
   managers of buildings refurbishment projects. In addition, the
   relationships between the factors of uncertainty and the performance of
   refurbishment projects will also be determined according to leadership
   qualities. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive bibliographic search
   was carried out, wherefrom this review, a research model was proposed.
   This model serves as a basis for broader research on leadership
   qualities among project managers to better manage uncertainties in
   refurbishment projects.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a model for maintenance and renovation of public
   sector buildings. The model creates the basis for the Buildpass
   application, which allows users to apply these methods through a web
   interface. The author researched innovative approaches in detail, in
   order to deal with the problems of maintenance and construction
   refurbishments indicated by companies dealing with software applications
   used for Facility Management. Maintenance and renovation represent a
   significant cost within the whole lifecycle of a built asset. Rational
   owners and facility managers try to minimize the outlays on maintenance
   and renovation. However, it is necessary to set a baseline condition
   above which the condition of buildings should be maintained, taking into
   account the type of usage and demands imposed on the building.
   The model must be applicable at a level that the user, who is not a
   civil engineering specialist, would be able to understand it without
   getting biased or misguided results. On the other hand, the aim is to
   create an environment where the civil engineering expert can intervene
   in the primary inputs of the model and thus use his/her own experience
   and knowledge. Attributes of the IT solution do exist the potential to
   work on various levels of the model's detail and the time exigency for
   obtaining information and tasks being solved. It is sometimes necessary
   to get data within a short timeframe, or alternative solutions to be
   analyzed, so it is key to focus only on the optimal solution identified,
   without wasting time exploring poor variants. The application must
   return a result within a short time, and at the same time not seriously
   bias the outputs. For a more in-depth analysis, the user then selects
   how much time they want to dedicate to the task. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {Strategies for Applying the Circular Economy to Prefabricated Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, a circular-economy framework is applied to the
   prefabricated building sector to explore the environmental advantages of
   prefabrication in terms of reduction, reusability, adaptability, and
   recyclability of its components. A qualitative approach is used to
   revisit the design, construction, and demolition stages of prefabricated
   buildings; in so doing, the circular-economy framework is applied to
   foster circular prefabricated modi operandi. Prefabrication of buildings
   can be divided into four entities: elements and components, panels (or
   non-volumetric elements), volumetric, and entire modules. Through an
   analysis of published research on how the circular economy can be
   applied to different industry sectors and production processes, seven
   strategies emerged, each of which revealed the potential of improving
   the circular economy of buildings. The first strategy is reduction of
   waste through a lean production chain. By reusing the waste, the second
   strategy investigates the use of by-products in the production of new
   components. The third strategy focuses on the reuse of replacement parts
   and components. The fourth strategy is based on design toward
   adaptability, respectively focusing on reusability of components and
   adapting components for a second use with a different purpose.
   Similarly, the fifth strategy considers the implications of designing
   for disassembly with Building Information Modeling so as to improve the
   end-of-life deconstruction phase. The sixth strategy focuses on design
   with attention to recyclability of used material. Finally, the seventh
   strategy considers the use of tracking technologies with embedded
   information on components' geometric and mechanic characteristics as
   well as their location and life cycle to enable second use after
   deconstruction. It is demonstrated that prefabricated buildings are key
   to material savings, waste reduction, reuse of components, and various
   other forms of optimization for the construction sector. By adopting the
   identified strategies in prefabricated buildings, a circular economy
   could be implemented within the construction industry. Finally, seven
   guidelines were distilled from the review and linked to the identified
   strategies. Owing to their degree of adaptability and capacity of being
   disassembled, prefabricated buildings would allow waste reduction and
   facilitate a second life of components.},

Title = {The ecoinvent database: Overview and methodological framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-9},
Abstract = {Introduction. This paper provides an overview on the content of the
   ecoinvent database and of selected metholodogical issues applied on the
   life cycle inventories implemented in the ecoinvent database.
   Goal, Scope and Background. In the year 2000, several Swiss Federal
   Offices and research institutes of the ETH domain agreed to a joint
   effort to harmonise and update life cycle inventory (LCI) data for its
   use in life cycle assessment (LCA). With the ecoinvent database and its
   actual data v1.1, a consistent set of more than 2'500 product and
   service LCIs is now available.
   Method. Nearly all process datasets are transparently documented on the
   level of unit process inputs and outputs. Methodological approaches have
   been applied consistently throughout the entire database content and
   thus guarantee for a coherent set of LCI data. This is particularly true
   for market and trade modelling (see, for example, electricity
   modelling), for the treatment of multioutput and of recycling processes,
   but also for the recording and reporting of elementary flows. The
   differentiation of diameter size for particulate matter emissions, for
   instance, allows for a more comprehensive impact assessment of human
   health effects. Data quality is quantitatively reported in terms of
   standard deviations of the amounts of input and output flows. In many
   cases qualitative indicators are reported additionally on the level of
   each individual input and output. The information sources used vary from
   extensive statistical works to individual (point) measurements or
   assumptions derived from process descriptions. However, all datasets
   passed the same quality control procedure and all information relevant
   and necessary to judge the suitability of a dataset in a certain context
   are provided in the database. Data documentation and exchange is based
   on the EcoSpold data format, which complies with the technical
   specification ISO/TS 14048. Free access to process information via the
   Internet helps the user to judge the appropriateness of a dataset.
   Concluding Remarks. The existence of the ecoinvent database proves that
   it is possible and feasible to build up a large interlinked system of
   LCI unit processes. The project work proved to be demanding in terms of
   co-ordination efforts required and consent identification. One main
   characteristic of the database is its transparency in reporting to
   enable individual assessment of data appropriateness and to support the
   plurality in methodological approaches.
   Outlook. Further work on the ecoinvent database may comprise work on the
   database content (new or more detailed datasets covering existing or new
   economic sectors), LCI (modelling) methodology, the structure and
   features of the database system (e.g. extension of Monte Carlo
   simulation to the impact assessment phase) or improvements in ecoinvent
   data supply and data query. Furthermore, the deepening and building up
   of international co-operations in LCI data collection and supply is in
   the focus of future activities.},

Abstract = {The presented paper is concerned with the capabilities of 3D geospatial
   technologies in the decision-support process for the design,
   construction, and employment of engineering structures. Among the
   various geospatial technologies, the primary stress is made on
   terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Despite the widespread application of
   TLS, its opportunities are not studied thoroughly. A vast volume of
   studies is dedicated to accuracy, processing workflow, and modeling by
   TLS data. However, only scanty research considers the TLS technology and
   data from an ordinary civil engineer's point of view. This study
   attempts to fill this gap. Covered topics are analysis of the current
   trends of measurement technologies; in-depth analysis of laser scanning
   results as a source of new unique data; laser scanning for industrial
   applications; laser scanning and BIM integration. Except for the
   mentioned topics, the new concept of the complete control of geometric
   parameters during the construction and operation of engineering
   structures is introduced. Complete control plays an indispensable role
   in the decision-support process during the building life cycle and
   therefore is an inherent part of any BIM. A description of the steps of
   complete control and its different applications for civil engineering is
   given. The decisionsupport process is addressed for different
   structures, e.g., roads, civil and industrial structures, oil and gas
   industry objects, etc. Moreover, complete control is considered for the
   various stages of a building life cycle, from design to demolition. The
   results provide convincing evidence that the complete control by TLS
   data has a prominent role in the decision-support process for civil
   engineering.},

Title = {Visual Language-Aided Construction Fire Safety Planning Approach in
   Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fires pose an enormous threat to human safety and many spectacular fires
   in under-construction buildings were reported over the past few years.
   Many construction sites only rely on fire extinguishers, as
   under-construction buildings do not contain a permanent fire protection
   system. Traditional safety planning lacks a justified approach for the
   firefighting equipment installation planning in the construction job
   site. Even though many government agencies made safety regulations for
   firefighting equipment installations, it is still a challenge to
   translate and execute these rules at the job site. Currently, the
   construction industry is devoted to discovering all the possible
   applications of Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology in the
   entire phases of the project life cycle. BIM technology enables the
   presentation of facilities in 3-D and offers rule-based modeling through
   visual programming tools. Therefore, this paper focuses on a visual
   language approach for rule translation and a multi-agent-based
   construction fire safety planning simulation in BIM. The proposed
   approach includes three core modules, namely: (a) Rule Extraction and
   Logic Development (RELD) Module, (b) Design for Construction Fire Safety
   (DCFS) Module, and (c) Con-fire Safety Plan Simulation (CSPS) Module. In
   addition, the DCFS module further includes three submodules, named as
   (1) Firefighting Equipment Installation (FEI) Module, (2) Bill of
   Quantities (BoQs) for firefighting Equipment (BFE) Module, and (3)
   Escape Route Plan (ERP) Module. The RELD module converts the OSHA fire
   safety rule into mathematical logic, and the DCFS module presents the
   development of the Con-fire Safety Planning approach by translating the
   rules from mathematical logic into computer-readable language. The three
   sub-modules of the DCFS module visualize the outputs of this research
   work. The CSPS module uses a multi-agent simulation to verify the safety
   rule compliance of the portable firefighting equipment installation plan
   the system in a BIM environment. A sample project case study has been
   implemented to validate the proof of concept. It is anticipated that the
   proposed approach has the potential to helps the designers through its
   effectiveness and convenience while it could be helpful in the field for
   practical use.},

Title = {Developing Critical Success Factors for Implementing Circular Economy in
   Building Construction Projects},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The construction industry continues to play a significant role in the
   economic development of most nations in the world. However, the
   construction sector still follows the `linear' `take-make-dispose'
   industrial model that, having benefited development, plays a major
   factor in the depletion of resources, environmental deterioration, and
   the generation of waste and pollution. In this regard, the adoption of a
   circular economy (CE) presents a compelling opportunity to address the
   challenges derived from the traditional linear economic model. This
   study attempts to scrutinise the critical success factors (CSFs) for
   implementing a CE via a mixed-method approach that combines both focus
   groups and an online survey. The adopted approach ensures a
   comprehensive identification and prioritisation of CSFs for implementing
   CE principles in building construction projects. The focus groups
   consisted of 20 key stakeholders drawn from prominent construction firms
   which included clients, consultants, contractors and designers. The
   outcomes from these focused groups led to the dentification of 43 CSFs,
   later categorised across different dimensions. Subsequently, an online
   survey was conducted to establish a priority list of the identified
   CSFs, using responses from 82 stakeholders to rate their level of
   importance. The top five significant CSFs include ensuring the use of
   standardised and warranted secondary materials, maintaining cost
   equivalence between a CE and linear approach, maintenance and operation
   cost minimisation, assessment of life cycle cost (LCC), and the
   enforcement of robust government regulations and policies that
   prioritise a CE. The Relative Importance Index (RII) was used to rank
   the identified CSFs following results obtained using the Statistical
   Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 27) and Excel for Microsoft 365. The
   findings of this study can inform the creation of decision support
   systems that could progress a CE across the construction project life
   cycle.},

Abstract = {Residential building construction is resource-intensive and
   significantly impacts the environment by embodied and operational carbon
   emissions. This study has adopted a parametric building information
   modelling (BIM)-based approach for a residential building to analyse its
   lifecycle carbon performance and to evaluate the optimisation potential
   through alternative material use and design. The study looks at a
   residential development project, applying an automatic calculation and
   analysis tool of upfront embodied carbon and BIM-based lifecycle energy
   simulation to predict carbon emissions from operating the built spaces.
   A parametric BIM model has been established to aid energy simulation and
   operational carbon assessment across a 50-year building lifetime,
   considering 1.5 degrees C Net-Zero World and 3 degrees C Hot House World
   climate scenarios. Various improvement opportunities for future
   residential development projects, from material selection to operational
   efficiencies, are explored. This includes quantitative analysis on
   architectural-structure design, low-carbon construction materials (e.g.,
   cement substitutes, steel scraps, and green hydrogen steel), and novel
   design for construction approaches (such as modular integrated
   construction), with discussion around their impacts on optimising the
   building lifecycle carbon performance. This study provides a deeper
   understanding and insights into the lifecycle performance of residential
   buildings to facilitate further exploration of achieving a more
   sustainable and low-carbon built environment.},

   using multi-objective optimization},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The protective energy-saving retrofitting (PESR) of heritage buildings
   (HBs) is one of the essential aspects of building carbon-dioxide
   abatement. The present work validates and optimizes PESR measures for a
   typical rammed earth HB (REHB) based on multi-objective optimization and
   building information modelling (BIM). The addition of internal thermal
   insulation materials to the exterior wall and roof and the replacement
   of the exterior windows are investigated. Based on multiple factors
   (protection methods, U-value limit, and local materials), seven
   insulation materials and four window types are considered in 28 possible
   cases. The associated energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GGE)
   and life cycle cost (LCC) are estimated and compared through
   comprehensive multi-objective (energy savings, low-carbon and economy)
   comparison methods. The results indicate that the case involving
   expanded polystyrene (EPS) internal insulation and 80-series
   polyurethane windows is optimal, with energy consumption and GGE that
   are 72\% and 50\% lower, respectively, than those of the original system
   and with the lowest cost, wherein 15406 kW h energy, 264 t GGE and 7857
   Chinese yuan (CNY) are saved over the entire life. The GGE and LCC at
   the operation stage account for approximately 90\% of the total, of
   which the associated coal heating accounts for 80\%. The optimization
   method can facilitate the development of innovative energy-saving and
   low-carbon retrofit methods for HBs.},

Abstract = {Rehearsal rooms play an important role in musicians' activities to
   obtain the best results during a performance in front of an audience.
   Numerous rehearsal rooms are located in complex buildings, such as opera
   houses and cultural centers, where new research outcomes have led to
   increasingly complex projects and construction phases. Furthermore,
   technical complexity has also increased due to the large quantity of
   used materials and the innovation level of the process. In this context,
   a new methodology becomes mandatory to control the indoor air quality
   and the acoustic quality in rehearsal rooms. This paper aims to offer a
   procedure for rehearsal rooms for large ensembles during the
   construction and life cycle phases to optimize the indoor environmental
   quality according to different types of ensembles and repertoires. In
   particular, rehearsal rooms with wood panel cladding are considered. The
   proposed methodology is controlled by a digital twin (DT) based on
   building information modeling (BIM), integrated with acoustic
   measurements, sensors and actuators aimed at implementing the database
   in real time. A case study is presented, in which the cladding system is
   described, the new methodology is applied, and the results are compared
   with the criteria suggested in the standard ISO 23591.},

Abstract = {The lifeline disaster prevention. and mitigation engineering is a
   multi-system management process. The comprehensive information of
   lifeline engineering being quickly obtained after earthquake may help us
   ensure the fast and efficient rescue, thus one building information
   modeling of urban lifeline disaster prevention and mitigation will be
   proposed based on multi- dimensional and micro-information storage. The
   model is divided into the following four modules: data integration
   module, establishment and preliminary evaluation module, analysis of
   function module, and integrated application module, which will help
   implement sharing information resources for different tasks. In this
   model the factors that affect planning before the earthquake and
   recovery after earthquake are considered, characteristics of application
   modes are analyzed from the following five aspects: location and
   analysis, team working, maintenance information management in life
   cycle, disaster prediction and post-disaster recovery simulation,
   management of underground disaster space. Then a comprehensive urban
   lifeline disaster management platform is proposed based on the building
   information modeling as the key link which is characterized by
   integrity, visibility and collaboration. In this paper, the application
   is introduced by taking one city's building information modeling of
   water supply network disaster prevention and mitigation as an example.
   The results indicate that this model is practical to provide strategic
   decisions for disaster prevention and mitigation.},

Title = {Extending IFC to incorporate information of RFID tags attached to
   building elements},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is emerging as a method of creating,
   sharing, exchanging and managing the building information throughout the
   lifecycle between all stakeholders. Radio Frequency Identification
   (RFID), on the other hand, has emerged as an automatic data collection
   and information storage technology, and has been used in different
   applications in the AEC/FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and
   Facilities Management) industry. RFID tags are attached to building
   assets throughout their lifecycle and used to store lifecycle and
   context aware information taken from a BIM. Consequently, there is a
   need for a standard and formal definition of RFID technology components
   in BIM. The goal of this paper is to add the definitions for RFID
   components to the BIM standard and to map the data to be stored in RFID
   memory to the associated entries in a BIM database. The paper defines
   new entities, data types, and properties to be added to the BIM.
   Furthermore, the paper identifies the relationships between RFID tags
   and building elements. These predefined relationships facilitate the
   linkage between BIM data and RFID data. Eventually, the data that are
   required to be saved on RFID tags can be automatically selected using
   the defined relationships in a BIM. A real-world case study has been
   implemented to validate the proposed method using available BIM
   software. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Through the description of the methodological approach and the results
   of some significant teachings within the Degree Courses of Study in
   ``Architecture{''} and in ``Building Sciences and Techniques{''}, the
   contribution aims to highlight the close relationship between the
   technological component and the environment one in the both Degree
   Courses. In particular, the teaching of the Laboratory of Architecture
   Technology (Study Course in Construction Sciences and Techniques)
   starting from the classification of the technological system proposed by
   the UNI 8290 standard, guides students to the identification of the
   various parts of the building organism and the relationships between
   them, focusing both on a systematic analysis of the users' needs
   requirements of the technological and environmental system, and to the
   understanding of traditional and innovative construction solutions.
   During the first years of Master Course in Architecture and the last
   year of Bachelor in Building Sciences and Techniques students are
   introduced in software for modeling the architecture and construction in
   general. Specifically, in both classes some experiences of parametric
   modeling have been carried out through the use of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) platform, stimulating students in the use digital
   platforms to manage the complexity of the project and the life cycle
   building, always in relation to all the actors in the building process.
   In particular, BIM lessons will provide to students methodological and
   operational tools for the construction and management of a parametric
   model to support both the architecture project and the existing built
   heritage recovery. The contents of lessons will also invoke and
   summarize technical, constructive and materials notions acquired by
   students in the previous years of course. During the last year of Degree
   Courses in Architecture the teaching of Environmental systems design
   aims to define, in the context of environmental modification
   constructions, the relationships established between existing and new
   environmental configurations, in order to optimize technologies,
   construction processes and materials to improve the quality of the
   environment and the achievement of human well-being. Technical awareness
   is pursued through the acquisition of information and knowledge that is
   applied to particular relevance case studies.},

Abstract = {The research in value-oriented design reports the importance of
   displaying the interdependencies between product components and
   stakeholders' values, where it argues that the display of
   interdependencies is indispensable for the optimal decision-making and
   for the success of the value-oriented design. However, applications for
   value visualization in the construction industry lack one or both of the
   following: (1) the support for multi-value assessment and visualization
   and (2) the ability to visualize value(s) over time. These two
   shortcomings hinder the construction industry from fully embracing
   sustainable valueoriented design. Hence, this paper proposes a
   visualization framework to bridge the gap in the practice of value
   visualization regarding (i) the number of visualized values and (ii)
   time-based multiple-value visualization. The paper also contains a case
   study that utilizes a condominium building to show the implementation of
   the proposed framework and demonstrate how results can be interpreted
   and utilized in the design process.},

Abstract = {Purpose Through an empirical study, this research proposes a
   multi-dimensional assessment method for Sustainable Building Design
   (SBD). This approach is adopted to investigate and evaluate the current
   practices of SBD and to provide a basis for refining such processes
   while reducing existing shortfalls. In doing so, a holistic sustainable
   framework for rating the sustainable performance of buildings is
   proposed. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the aforementioned
   purpose, this research (1) investigates the most current trends in SBD
   including the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM); (2) examines
   the practical issues of SBD; (3) proposes a multi-dimensional assessment
   method; and (4) compares 18 separate case studies in the three countries
   of Australia, United Kingdom and USA, as part of the SBD implementation.
   To compare these case studies, an additional SBD tool, Green Building
   Rating and Certification System (GBELS) was carefully selected and
   applied. Five core values of SBD were identified based on functionality,
   accessibility and productivity, which align with the GBELS outcomes.
   Findings This research found that, for the 18 examined buildings, the
   main issues in SBD in the three countries concerned environmental and
   ecological issues. These included the impacts of buildings on the
   environment, as well as issues concerning the buildings' life cycle
   analysis and assessment. It was also determined that energy usage,
   pollution reduction and climate change concerns were important
   inclusions in establishing these buildings, particularly in the USA.
   Originality/value To support the research aim, this paper explores the
   most innovative trends in SBD assessments including their Structural
   Health Monitoring (SHM), grade (stars) classification, Relative Weight
   (RW) and particularly GBELS. GBELS was selected for this research, since
   it is relatively new and there is little available literature discussing
   its adaptation. Accordingly, this research further evaluates the
   application of GBELS as a part of versatility in SBD multi-dimensional
   assessment method. As the basis of these tests, a total of 18 separate
   case studies are closely evaluated.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing trend towards developing and maintaining
   multidisciplinary, integrated databases of historical and current
   information of building projects. And, there is a need to define an
   information highway, or data exchange system, for the AEC industry.
   Currently, many phases of building projects are being automated
   separately. Electronic data created for one phase is not necessarily
   utilized in subsequent phases of the building project. Many procedures
   for transferring the resulting electronic data are based on traditional
   manual methods. Thus, the current flow and utilization of electronic
   data from the commencement of a building project is erratic at hest
   It is our responsibility to look at the larger picture of rite entire
   building process in light of the changing technology available to
   building professionals. This evaluation of the structure, creation,
   management, coordination, and communication of information during the
   Life cycle of Lu ge building projects is imperative as a basis for the
   next evolution of computerized building design models that should live
   throughout the life of a building.
   This evaluation must be made with an open mind, free of the conceptions
   of today's professional and organizational techniques. We should keep
   tomorrow's computing technology in mind and consider the possibility of
   evolving new roles and responsibilities for Be various building
   professionals. In this framework, we can consider how an integrated
   computer model might reconfigure the coordination and communication
   among building professionals and their clients.},

Abstract = {There is currently an explosion of research on microsensor and wireless
   network technology, and methods of discerning structural state from such
   data. Besides the inherent interest in such fascinating technology, the
   question remains as to why an owner, operator, or user of the built
   environment should care. The construction industry is now adopting new
   types of contracting practice. Previously the contractor simply
   implemented a given design, but the current trend is for clients to
   commission certain performance requirements to be met with
   performance-based design. The emphasis of the industry is becoming the
   delivery of certain structural behavior states rather than simply
   building to a client's set plans. The contracting process becomes the
   determination of the performance criteria, and delivery becomes a
   long-term fulfillment of these criteria. This can only take place if the
   performance states can be measured, and the measurement utilized in a
   decision-making process. The tools needed for both the evaluation of the
   delivery after construction and during operation are changing
   accordingly. The process is increasingly dependent on densely spaced
   sensor data, valid models to turn the data into physical behavior, and
   decision-making tools to determine whether the performance requirements
   are being met. This process must take place in order to satisfy all
   stakeholders. This paper describes the approaches in monitoring the
   performance, the obtaining of data and refining into information for
   decision making. Example cases concern the continuous performance and
   condition monitoring within buildings and civil structures, and
   indicators of the economical impacts of informed decisions including
   structural safety, hygro-thermal, and energy aspects. A case study of
   structural health monitoring of the Golden Gate Bridge is also
   presented. The enabling sensor technology is described, and the
   exploitation of the data for life cycle needs is discussed.},

Abstract = {Most engineering systems used in maintenance strategies must consider

   deterioration and earthquakes simultaneously on structural performance,
   this study applies an integral simulation method. Compared with that of
   previous studies, the feature of the proposed method is its analysis of
   the time-dependent structural capacity of a deteriorating reinforced
   concrete (RC) building and the simulation of life-cycle earthquake
   events within a specified service period, while considering cumulative
   damage induced by deterioration and earthquakes. In addition, the
   proposed assessment method is applied to derive the reliability-based
   service life of a deteriorating RC building located in a region with
   high seismic hazard. Briefly, for deteriorating RC buildings, the
   proposed reliability-based service life assessment method provides
   useful information related to maintenance based on both serviceability

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1418-1440},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study advocates a modular approach combining unit processes as
   building blocks to formulate biomass process chains. This approach
   facilitates a transparent environmental life cycle impact assessment for
   bio-based products. It also enhances the ability to develop and assess
   more complex biorefinery systems, identifies critical parameters and
   offers useful material to support environmental impact assessment in
   early design stages.
   Twenty-three different products were assessed with regard to the
   environmental burden associated with their production paths. Life cycle
   inventories (LCIs) for 32 unit processes were compiled (using
   information from pilot plants, simulation and literature data) and
   organized in biomass process chains. Then, 58 study systems were formed
   based on various combinations of the unit processes, each study system
   referring to the production of a selected product. Three indicators were
   used for quantification of the impacts: non-renewable fossil cumulative
   energy demand (CED), global warming potential (GWP) and water depletion
   as defined in the ReCiPe method.
   Factors influencing the variation of results even for similar products
   are discussed (e.g. production path and allocation method lead to a
   range of GWP values for ethylene production from 0.43 to 3.37 kg CO2
   eq/kg ethylene). For the majority of bio-products, CED has lower values
   than fossil-based equivalents (average difference 39-70 MJ eq/kg product
   depending on the allocation method), while mixed trends are obtained for
   the GWP and water depletion indicators. Assessments also highlight
   attributes that have a significant effect in the environmental profile
   of a production path such as the synthesis path, the process chemistry
   (water intensity) and process-related factors (energy intensity, degree
   of energy integration/heat recovery).
   The analysis of impacts per unit process is able to demonstrate the
   particular production stages featuring high environmental intensities
   along a path further hinting to suggestions for amendments and
   improvements from an overall performance perspective. The study makes a
   useful source for biorefinery design studies especially in adopting a
   modular approach to represent and to analyse biomass process chains; it
   also provides a reference point for comparison (benchmarking) between
   different process technologies for biomass utilization. Finally, the
   analysis is compatible with the standards of the LCA methodology, and it
   is based on the use of the most common LCA databases, which facilitates
   the comparison of the results with other relevant studies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The integration of circular economy (CE) principles with modular
   construction (MC) provides an effective solution for extending building
   life cycles and managing resources within a closed-loop system, thereby
   mitigating the environmental impact of the construction industry.
   Despite this potential, the connection between MC and CE remains
   underexplored in existing literature. This research aims to address this
   gap by conducting a systematic literature review to explore the growing
   interest in this integrated field. Following the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, 67
   studies were selected for analysis. A descriptive analysis confirmed
   increasing global attention towards MC and CE. Subsequently, topic
   modeling and content analysis identified four key research areas: (1)
   Life cycle sustainability assessment, (2) Secondary raw materials, (3)
   Strategies and implementation, and (4) Innovative structure and system
   design. The findings reveal several gaps, including the limited scope of
   sustainability assessment studies, the challenges of developing
   secondary products and innovative structures in laboratory environments,
   the scarcity of practical validation for proving positive impacts, and
   the need for advancements in circular information management and
   information and communication technologies. This review concludes by
   proposing a research agenda with five research directions to address
   these gaps. The main contribution of this research lies in its provision
   of actionable insights for both academics and industry practitioners,
   aimed at pursuing sustainable construction practices by advancing MC
   through CE.},

Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {This systematic review critically examines the intersection of digital
   transformation and circular economy (CE) principles within the built
   environment. While digitalisation has been shown to enhance efficiency,
   safety, and sustainability in construction, its role in fostering
   circularity is less established. This study analyzes literature from
   2010 to 2022, focusing on how digital technologies such as open-BIM,
   digital twins, material passports, blockchain, RFID, and gamification
   can integrate into and enhance the circular building lifecycle. The
   findings reveal that while digital tools are pivotal in design and
   construction phases, their application to existing structures is less
   straightforward, with challenges including the absence of digital twins
   for demolished structures, the high costs of retrofit digitalisation,
   and the predominant focus on environmental benefits over practical
   implementation. The review also highlights the need for a unified
   digital transformation strategy and greater cross-industry
   collaboration. Future research directions are proposed, including the
   development of localized material banks, the application of RFID in
   circularity, the scope of Design for Disassembly (DfD) tools, digital
   inventory of existing buildings, the circularity of Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) databases, and policy implications for promoting
   circular construction practices.},

Abstract = {Botnets continue to be an active threat against firms or companies and
   individuals worldwide. Previous research regarding botnets has unveiled
   information on how the system and their stakeholders operate, but an
   insight on the economic structure that supports these stakeholders is
   lacking. The objective of this research is to analyse the business model
   and determine the revenue stream of a botnet owner. We also study the
   botnet life-cycle and determine the costs associated with it on the
   basis of four case studies. We conclude that building a full scale cyber
   army from scratch is very expensive where as acquiring a previously
   developed botnet requires a little cost. We find that initial setup and
   monthly costs were minimal compared to total revenue.},

Title = {Developing an MCDM Model for the Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and
   Risks of BIM Adoption},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) offers various deterministic and
   uncertain benefits and costs. Although there are similarities between
   such costs and benefits in developed and developing countries, these
   factors should be analyzed carefully for each region/country due to
   differences in economic and technical status as well as available
   policies and regulations. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
   benefits and shortcomings of BIM adoption around the globe; however,
   there is scarce comprehensive research focusing on Iran with unique
   financial circumstances. The aim of this research is to investigate the
   benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCRs) offered by BIM
   implementation in Iran as a developing country with high potential in
   but less adoption of BIM in construction projects. After identifying the
   BOCRs of BIM adoption from the literature, the Interval-Valued Fuzzy
   Delphi Method was used to identify the BOCRs while a novel
   multi-criteria decision-making approach (i.e., fuzzy parsimonious
   analytic hierarchy process) was employed to analyze BOCRs, respectively.
   The results showed that 4 out of 46 BOCRs gathered from the literature
   were not significant for Iran and should be omitted from further
   analysis, while one cost factor was added to the list. Also, it was
   revealed that ``Facilitates project communication among
   stakeholders{''}, ``Integrating life-cycle assessment dimensions to the
   decision-making process{''}, ``Cost/efforts required to personnel
   training{''} and ``Lack of national standard, procedures and
   guidelines{''} were the most significant BOCRs, respectively. These
   findings contributed to filling the research gap in BIM adoption in Iran
   using a novel methodology that provides deep insights into BIM adoption
   for practitioners and can be used as a basis for developing theoretical
   and conceptual research frameworks. The findings of this study are built
   upon the opinions of experts within the context of Iran and should be
   considered as a snapshot of the BOCRs of the adoption of BIM in Iranian
   construction projects while these are not futureproofed.},

Title = {An axiomatic method for goal-dependent allocation in life cycle
   assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1223-1235},

Abstract = {Purpose How to apply allocation in an life cycle assessment (LCA) is a
   long-running and controversial debate. Consensus seems to exist on the
   fact that the allocation procedure should follow logically from the LCA
   goal definition. This paper proposes to use an axiomatic method to (1)
   identify an allocation procedure for co-production, joint treatment, and
   recycling, that best responds to a specific LCA goal and (2) communicate
   the rationale applied by the LCA practitioner transparently. The method
   is illustrated via a case study. Materials and methods The specific goal
   definition for which a suitable allocation procedure is identified is to
   evaluate what impacts can be attributed to a product, which could inform
   a company about potential sources of reputation damage. Subjective
   assumptions that reflect our vision of ``what impacts can be attributed
   to a product{''} are described in definitions and axioms. Results and
   discussion Axioms are formulated that describe the system boundaries of
   the product system and the partitioning criterion. The derived
   allocation procedure corresponds to ``Allocation at the Point of
   Substitution,{''} which is applied in one of the system models of
   ecoinvent. Partitioning is based on market information, which
   corresponds to a cause-oriented perspective on ``what impacts can be
   attributed to a product.{''} Other LCA goal definitions and rationales
   could require different system boundaries or a different partitioning
   criterion. Conclusions and perspectives The axiomatic method presented
   in this paper supports the identification of a suitable allocation
   procedure for a defined LCA goal and the transparent communication of
   the rationale that backs up this procedure. Building forth on the
   approach of this paper, a collection of axioms and corresponding
   allocation procedures could be developed on which consensus might exist
   within the LCA community. Such goal-dependent allocation procedures
   could form the basis of future guidance on LCA.},

Abstract = {The documentation of the architectural heritage requires the storage of
   large amounts of information that must be stored and processed in very
   different formats, since it comes from experts from different areas of
   knowledge. This heterogeneity of information makes communication
   difficult among professionals who participate in documentation work,
   such as restorers, architects, engineers, archaeologists or historians,
   with the transfer of information being one of the biggest problems to be
   solved, through the creation of a methodology that favors the diffusion
   and accessibility to the materials coming from the investigation. The
   aim of the study is to create a protocol or methodology, to create a
   graphic database that allows the inventory of the architectural heritage
   in Aragon. The solution implies the development of a geometric model
   that allows to include and relate information related to it. The format
   is a HBIM model capable of incorporating information on a stratified
   support, with visualization, documentation and management capabilities
   that allow a complete view of the building to be cataloged,
   incorporating useful information for its conservation, restoration,
   protection and dissemination, as well as interoperability between tools
   and other systems throughout the entire life cycle of the object. In
   this research, we will work with the virtual platform Petrobim, a tool

Title = {Simulating the effect of sustainable buildings and energy efficiency
   standards on electricity consumption in four cities in Colombia: A
   system dynamics approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {314},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Buildings contribute to about 40\% of direct and indirect greenhouse gas
   emissions and more than a third of energy consumption globally.
   Sustainable building standards and efficiency standards are two measures
   to reduce such emissions and energy consumption in buildings. While
   better standards improve the sustainability of new buildings, the impact
   of these actions depends on the ability to improve the existing building
   stock. Un-derstanding the dynamics of adopting efficiency and
   sustainable building measures is essential for setting policy targets
   and mechanisms. This paper proposes a system dynamics model for
   assessing the energy savings potential from adopting sustainable
   building and energy efficiency measurements in buildings in systems with
   incomplete and uncertain information, using prospective scenarios. The
   model combines a dynamic diffusion model with an aggregate model for the
   building stock. The model is calibrated for estimating energy savings in
   the residential and commercial building stock of the four main
   metropolitan areas of Colombia: Bogot ` a, Medellin, Cali, and
   Barranquilla. Simulation results show that the maximum energy savings
   potential is approximately 12\% but could be below 8\% if rebound
   effects are considered. Results show that energy savings are limited if
   there are no policies for existing old buildings.},

   environmental agenda, it is essential to comprehensively scrutinize the
   environmental, social, and economic impacts of construction projects
   from the project's design stage. Such assessment is of utmost importance
   to minimize the impacts of both new construction and rehabilitation
   projects and is particularly critical during the selection of building
   materials and construction solutions. This work reports improvements in
   functionality and user-friendliness of an eco-design tool
   (UAveiroGreenBuilding) targeting the construction/rehabilitation sector
   and previously developed within our research group. The optimized
   version of the eco-design tool underwent validation through the
   assessment of competitive window frame materials (e.g., wood, PVC, and
   aluminum) for potential implementation in a rehabilitation project.
   Windows with PVC frames were identified as the preferred window
   configuration due to their superior environmental performance and
   favorable economic profile. Additionally, a digital communication
   interface was developed to connect the eco-design tool with building
   information modeling (BIM) projects, achieved through a routine
   integrated using a Dynamo application. Such successful integration not
   only streamlined and expedited the data transfer process by obviating
   the need for manual input but it also enabled the storage of
   environmental data throughout the life cycle of the project using a
   simple and reliable data storage protocol.},

Abstract = {During the life cycle of a smart building, an extensive amount of
   heterogeneous information is required to plan, construct, operate and
   maintain the building and its technical systems. Traditionally, there is
   an information gap between the different phases and stakeholders,
   leading to information being exchanged, processed and stored in a
   variety of mostly human-readable documents. This paper shows how a
   knowledge graph can be established as integrated information model that
   can provide the required information for all phases in a
   machine-interpretable way. The knowledge graph describes and connects
   all relevant information, which allows combining and applying it in a
   holistic way. This makes the knowledge graph a key enabler for a variety
   of advanced, computerized engineering tasks, ranging from the planning
   and design phases over the commissioning and the operation of a
   building. The computerized engineering of building automation systems
   (BAS) with an advanced software tool chain is presented as such a use
   case in more detail. The knowledge graph is based on standard semantic
   web technologies and builds on existing ontologies, such as the Brick
   and QUDT ontologies, with various novel extensions presented in this
   paper. Special attention is given to the rich semantic definition of the
   entities, such as the equipment and the typically thousands of
   datapoints in a BAS, which can be achieved as a combination of
   contextual modeling and semantic tagging.},

Title = {Towards fully BIM-enabled building automation and robotics: A
   perspective of lifecycle information flow},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has seen
   a continuous growth in the application of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) over the last two decades while building automation and robotics
   is also gaining ground in the meantime. With more joint applications of
   both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for
   robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be
   fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper
   presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative
   analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building
   automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in
   Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior
   knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics
   in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and
   feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of
   lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three
   typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing,
   assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the
   potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally,
   a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed
   to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR
   framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are
   discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. (C) 2021

Title = {Modelling and analysis of the energy intensity in polyacrylonitrile
   (PAN) precursor and carbon fibre manufacturing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {303},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Carbon fibre manufacturing is characterized by a high energy demand due
   to long processing times and energy intensive thermal processes. Since
   energy flow related information about the carbon fibre production is
   rare, lacks in detail and ranges widely, the goal of this paper is to
   increase the transparency of energy flows in the carbon fibre value
   chain. To this end, the extended energy value stream methodology was
   modified and applied on a research scale polyacrylonitrile precursor
   line and a pilot scale carbon fibre line. The paper takes in a holistic
   factory understanding when quantifying energy demands and it provides
   highly-detailed energy related data across the carbon fibre
   manufacturing process chain. Energy demands are broken down into energy
   carriers, process steps and peripheral levels of the carbon fibre
   production system. The results of the paper lay a first valuable step
   towards a comprehensive life cycle inventory of carbon fibre
   manufacturing. Furthermore, the high transparency of energy data
   provides a starting point for future research to increase the energy
   efficiency of carbon fibre manufacturing. With respect to the high share
   of the technical building services on the total energy demand, the paper
   emphasizes the need for an integrated assessment and improvement of the
   manufacturing process and technical building services.

Abstract = {Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging
   of digital transactions. It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and
   other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize
   computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was
   unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research
   on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction
   industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues
   that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to
   the capabilities of blockchain.
   We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a
   dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the
   relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that
   particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of
   information management was necessary because of technology. When using
   un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants
   show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment,
   blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information
   management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building
   information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized
   building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage
   information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any
   legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain
   can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction
   logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the
   facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure
   storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy.
   We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems
   in construction information management. However, it is more likely that
   it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which
   construction applications are built, rather than used directly by
   authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make
   construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research
   in that direction.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has increasingly responded to challenge that
   more sustainable buildings can be delivered more efficiently only
   through implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) into
   practice. Hence, graduates of civil engineering studies should become
   familiar with BIM technology and achieve relevant knowledge and skills.
   Based on literature review and experiences from studies of foreign
   universities can be concluded that a team-based learning strategy may
   help students grow crucial BIM knowledge and skills and obtain a better
   learning through role play in the context of a real BIM project. One
   from basic premises of BIM is collaboration by different stakeholders at
   different phases of the life cycle of a facility from conceptual
   planning and designing to facility disposal. The integration of BIM
   learning and team-based learning is supposed to improve the teaching
   effectiveness of construction knowledge and skills in science but
   especially in collaboration and practice. A group of students in the
   Faculty of Civil Engineering in Kosice is included into a course
   established on the team-based learning strategy and oriented on
   construction projects designing and management. Such learning should
   improve their knowledge and transversal skills in all construction
   participants' cooperation. This is one from representative opportunities
   to integrate the BIM technology into team-based learning of engineering
   students. The paper focuses on this team-based learning course and
   suggests the necessity of such integration. In practice, elaboration and
   implementation of BIM Execution Plan (BEP) presents the basis for
   successful practicability of project through BIM technology. At the
   same, the BEP is inevitable for communication and collaboration of
   students in educational process of the above-mentioned course. A very
   useful part of analysis of BEP principles and documentation is presented
   and discussed in the paper.},

Title = {A Predictive Environmental Assessment Method for Construction
   Operations: Application to a Northeast China Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Construction accounts for a considerable number of environmental
   impacts, especially in countries with rapid urbanization. A predictive
   environmental assessment method enables a comparison of alternatives in
   construction operations to mitigate these environmental impacts.
   Process-based life cycle assessment (pLCA), which is the most widely
   applied environmental assessment method, requires lots of detailed
   process information to evaluate. However, a construction project usually
   operates in uncertain and dynamic project environments, and capturing
   such process information represents a critical challenge for pLCA.
   Discrete event simulation (DES) provides an opportunity to include
   uncertainty and capture the dynamic environments of construction
   operations. This study proposes a predictive assessment method that
   integrates DES and pLCA (DES-pLCA) to evaluate the environmental impact
   of on-site construction operations and supply chains. The DES feeds pLCA
   with process information that considers the uncertain and dynamic
   environments of construction, while pLCA guides the comprehensive
   procedure of environmental assessment. A DES-pLCA prototype was
   developed and implemented in a case study of an 18-storey building in
   Northeast China. The results showed that the biggest impact variations
   on the global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP),
   eutrophication (EP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP),
   abiotic depletion potential (ADP), and human toxicity potential (HTP)
   were 5.1\%, 4.1\%, 4.1\%, 4.7\%, 0.3\%, and 5.9\%, respectively, due to
   uncertain and dynamic factors. Based on the proposed method, an average
   impact reduction can be achieved for these six indictors of 2.5\%,
   21.7\%, 8.2\%, 4.8\%, 32.5\%, and 0.9\%, respectively. The method also
   revealed that the material wastage rate of formwork installation was the
   most crucial managing factor that influences global warming performance.
   The method can support contractors in the development and management of
   environmentally friendly construction operations that consider the
   effects of uncertainty and dynamics.},

Abstract = {Many small companies ask themselves how and when to begin participating
   in the information revolution, and what changes this may bring to their

   an information system is a dynamic process. The total quality management
   (TQM) methodology is recommended for building these systems and it
   requires an uninterrupted process and the participation of employees at
   all levels. Steps are proposed and traps are listed to which companies
   should pay special attention when updating their information systems.

Abstract = {LOIN for elements of the geological-geotechnical ground model The \&
   Ouml;NORM EN 17412-1 defines the Level of Information Need (LOIN)
   through clear specifications on requirements and responsibilities, as
   well as the integration of geometric and alphanumeric information and as
   well as documentation requirements. For geological-geotechnical ground
   models with the aim of defining ground elements, the LOIN has not yet
   been described in more detail. Previous work focused mainly on the
   geometric realisation of ground models, in this paper the focus of the
   LOIN is set on the alphanumeric information. It is explained how
   geological information of the four planning phases the basic survey,
   exploration planning, exploration and interpretation can be implemented
   in digital models in a structured and comprehensive way to ensure a
   transfer without loss of information to geotechnical planning. A
   project-related definition of the LOIN for selected ground elements, for
   example the element ``borehole{''}, enables a precise and structured
   provision of data, avoids information overload and supports well-founded
   decisions and efficient planning over the entire life cycle of a
   building. It emphasizes the need for a well-defined LOIN, as well as
   early involvement and coordination with project stakeholders for
   effective geotechnical planning and ongoing modelling of geological

Abstract = {Planned conservation approach requires a sustained, long-term action to
   better manage the cultural heritage assets during their life cycle.
   Together with programmed conservation and local interventions, there is
   a large amount of information related to the building; it emerges the
   need for an appropriate tool in which to store all data. Historic
   Building Information Modelling (HBIM) can be an appropriate way to
   address this issue. In this context, the lack of automatic tools (to
   speed up the project) and the need for data interpretation in the
   process are noticeable, especially for cultural heritage items. In this
   paper we present a practical case study. Starting from an integrated
   survey of Mantua Cathedral (located in Northern Italy) we developed a
   HBIM model of its facade. Particular emphasis is given to data
   interpretation both from geometrical survey and from historical sources.
   The resulting model is consistent and coherent with reality. As a
   result, we state that the development of a HBIM model is not an
   automatized process. In the process, from the survey to the final model,
   there is the need for a deep knowledge and a deep understanding of the
   building, not only in term of geometrical survey but also of its
   historical phases, its changes in time, its materials and the
   construction techniques. HBIM can be a useful instrument for planned
   conservation, which strongly requires a coherent model to be effective
   and useful. A proper model, working as an integrated archive, can
   increase the effectiveness of planned conservation.},

   Joints Based on Case-Based Reasoning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Precast components are a critical part of the life cycle of
   prefabricated construction. Component joints and connections are
   essential to structural stability, posing rework problems. The design of
   precast component joints requires tacit and explicit knowledge. Existing
   joint design approaches and construction requirements underuse tacit
   knowledge. This paper proposes a case-based reasoning (CBR) model to
   support the design of component joints based on this tacit knowledge. A
   case library of 299 valid precast slabs was used to develop the model.
   The test cases in the model were used to verify the methodology. Records
   for 64 test cases with the same building information and 64 test cases
   from different buildings were used to validate the usability and
   effectiveness of the model. The results show that the accuracy rates are
   100\% and 94\% when considering the comprehensive performance, and the
   model is more effective for different buildings than for the same
   building. The proposed model can improve the efficiency of joint design
   without expert participation and improve the standardization and
   coordination of design and construction.},

Title = {Fast bidirectional building performance optimization at the early design
   stage},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Decisions made at the early design stage have tremendous impacts on
   building performance (energy consumption, daylight, life cycle cost,
   natural ventilation, sunshine hours, etc.). Owing to progress in the
   design process, the opportunity to improve building performance is
   constantly reducing, while the cost of optimization is constantly
   increasing. The literature review shows that the commonly used building
   performance optimization workflow is divided into two categories: the
   forward optimization workflow and the inverse optimization workflow. In
   the forward workflow, designers are allowed to optimize building schemes
   according to feedback gleaned from the performance metrics; in the
   inverse workflow, however, designers are allowed to utilize software to
   search for optimal design solutions. Both workflows have their
   advantages, and their collective advantages can result in a highly
   efficient building design; however, in practice, the two processes are
   often separated. Furthermore, the simulation engines used in these two
   workflows are simulation software quite widely used. Using these
   software often requires a large amount of information, which are not
   suitable for an early design. In this paper, a bidirectional workflow
   for building performance optimization at the early design stage is
   proposed. The building energy consumption prediction model is then
   improved to make the workflow provide real-time performance feedback,
   and the optimization workflow is realized in SketchUp. This approach can
   provide quick feedback from building performance metrics, and allows
   designers to search for optimal solutions, using a genetic algorithm to
   support early design decisions. Because of the different structures of
   the simplified model and the standard model in BESTEST, we chose to use
   the results of DesignBuilder as the baseline to calibrate the simplified
   model. The model verification results show that the relative deviation
   of the total energy consumption of working condition 1 and 2 is between
   20\% and 27\% due to the relatively large heating deviation in Beijing.
   The relative deviation of the total energy consumption of other cities
   is within 10\%. In future work, we plan to rebuild the codes of the
   simplified model, and perform energy calibration under the standard
   procedure in BESTEST. Finally, the workflow is illustrated through a
   case study. Compared to previous studies, through the inverse-forward
   workflow and the simplified energy prediction model, the proposed
   workflow is demonstrated to better provide fast performance optimization
   at the early design stage.},

   application of GIS and remote sensing},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION \& RECYCLING ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Existing building stocks (BS) were not designed or constructed with
   circular economic (CE) strategies. Hence, recycling is vital in enabling
   CE in such BS. However, the lack of information about the scale and
   scope of the forecasted BS waste and its geo-located data hinders
   decisions on the selection of locations for recycling centres and proper
   landfills and evidence-based policy developments. BS mining, assisted
   with geographic information systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data are
   ideal for generating BS data and assisting end-of-life decisions for CE.
   However, the number of studies that have compared different BS data
   collection methods and analysis techniques is limited. This study
   investigates the research maturity of GIS, remote sensing, spatial
   analysis, and complementary methods adopted in BS mining and CE studies
   using a systematic literature review. As a critical outcome, a
   conceptual framework was developed to assist future BS mining, CE
   studies and industry practice.},

Title = {ROAD MODELLING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT - THE EFFICIENT USE OF
   GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {438-457},
Abstract = {The construction sector is undergoing a digital transition. Local
   authorities have adopted geographic information systems (GISs) to plan
   their territories and structure their services, such as transport.
   Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has demonstrated
   its advantages during the design and construction phases of structures.
   An infrastructure project can rely on these two technologies to plan its
   implementation (GIS), to complete its design and construction (BIM), or
   to manage associated services, such as mobility (GIS). However, road
   maintenance, an important part of the infrastructure's life cycle, is
   not yet covered by these technologies. Road maintenance necessitates a
   comprehensive view of the infrastructure and its interactions with other
   real-world objects (e.g. vegetation, technical networks, or vehicles).
   Moreover, road managers are the local authorities that already use GISs.
   For these reasons, a GIS is suitable for fulfilling road maintenance
   requirements. This study presents a spatial framework (GIS) developed
   for road management. Applying it to a specific case study provides
   insights on the organisation of the spatial road framework which can be
   adapted to the infrastructure's environment management. The spatial
   dimension must allow for the representation of the road and its
   components, including pavements and their dependencies. The structural
   dimension must be detailed to describe the layers, their formulations,
   and their thicknesses. The condition of the road must be described
   concisely so that the managers can plan maintenance.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Tools for economic sustainability analyses are crucial for residential
   sector which is associated with high energy use. Along with the
   development of such tools, their effective implementation in building
   projects depend on their uptake by holistic design and modelling
   approaches, with BIM standing out as an exemplary case. Accordingly, the
   purpose of this study is to develop a fully representative economic
   sustainability assessment framework for residential buildings, with
   implications for BIM. A serious lag in research within the area of
   residential building economic sustainability assessment and use of BIM
   is realized from a systematic review of published studies. Through
   literature, a taxonomy of economic sustainability indicators, parameters
   and sub-parameters is developed, which helped design an economic
   sustainability assessment framework. An international survey and
   structured interviews are conducted to find the importance weights for
   the economic sustainability dimension as well as different framework
   constituents. The functionality of framework is validated through a case
   study, providing a conclusive value of 48.25\% for economic performance
   of subject building, which is representative of the effectiveness of
   assessment for decision-makings. An extension within BIM environment is
   suggested to help foresee a futuristic integration of BIM with economic
   sustainability assessment.},

Title = {The INNOVance BIM library approach},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The construction sector is nowadays affected by a great evolution
   concerning the information management along the building life cycle.
   Great efforts have been devoted by International, European and national
   working groups for addressing BIM-related issues and for overcoming
   barriers that can possibly arise within BIM-based processes. In the
   Italian context, a national research project, namely INNOVance, has been
   carried out, proposing solutions for managing information concerning
   construction works. A classification system, an information structure, a
   database and BIM objects have been developed for products and objects
   adopted in construction works, for spaces characterising buildings and
   for actors involved along the whole building process. The presented
   paper describes the main objectives and results of the project, focusing
   on the approach adopted for the development of a BIM library.
   Requirements of objects classified and standardised through the
   INNOVance BIM library approach have been defined starting from an
   analysis of the state of the art. Particularly, a literature review of
   BIM guidelines and existing product libraries has been carried out,
   providing a reliable picture of the actual situation concerning the
   standardisation of information and highlighting main innovations of the
   proposed approach. Furthermore, a collaboration has been established
   with different stakeholders (as product manufacturers and construction
   companies) for analysing current practises and identifying information
   requirements for satisfying their needs related to information
   collection and transmission. The proposed approach for the development
   of the BIM library takes advantages of a consistent information
   structure. Among the main benefits, the developed solution is
   software-independent, it is not only design-orientated and it collects
   information related to different systems (e.g., spatial system,
   technological system, environmental system, and process).},

Title = {A Survey on Integration of Optimization and Project Management Tools for
   Sustainable Construction Scheduling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Construction scheduling, in practice, commonly relies on the usage of
   commercial project management tools (PMT) without specific optimization
   features. To obtain optimal schedules, planners often need to develop
   separate optimization models with special tools, which, however, demand
   further processing and editing of optimization results by PMT into forms
   expected for project management. In this regard, separation of
   optimization and PMT also requires considerable additional work for
   complete and harmonized updating of schedules during construction
   execution. Mentioned drawbacks and lack of available time may take to
   deficient construction scheduling during the implementation phase
   resulting in poor or even insufficient realization of project goals.
   Therefore, this paper presents an achievements survey on the integration
   of optimization and PMT that allow sustainable construction scheduling,
   particularly in terms of continuous optimal time and resource allocation
   throughout the project life cycle. Such work has not yet been
   comprehensively done up to now and the present contribution intends to
   fill a literature gap in the aforesaid area. Following a brief
   introduction, the optimization platform for construction scheduling is
   given in the article. Focusing on construction scheduling, an in-depth
   achievements survey on the integration of heuristics methods,
   mathematical programming and special solving methods with conventional
   PMT as well as optimization-based building information modeling (BIM)
   tools is then performed and findings are reported. The paper ends with
   conclusions and recommendations for further research.},

Abstract = {To elevate advanced automation and consumer dynamics to meet future
   needs, the energy industry needs to migrate to industry-level
   architecture. The Electric Power Research Institute recently completed
   the initial phase of an Industry-Wide Architecture called The
   IntelliGrid Architecture. Building upon past EPRI and industry standards
   development, the IntelliGrid Architecture is directing the industry to
   move toward greater and more effective use of emerging open standards.
   The standards emerging from the International Electrotechnical
   Commission TC 57 working groups, such as IEC 61850, bring substantial
   new capability to the open standards available to integrate advanced
   automation equipment. IEC 61850 enables not only advanced communications
   for power engineering applications but can enable improved systems and
   network management and security. These life-cycle management
   capabilities are necessary for appropriately integrating field equipment
   and information systems communications with substation operations. The
   concepts put forward by the IntelliGrid Architecture encourage more
   rigorous approaches to systems engineering and requirements engineering
   for the design and development of advanced automation systems. These
   toots and methods are necessary to manage the complexity that will come
   with the next generation of advanced automation. This paper describes
   several of the key concepts that are important to the advancement of
   interoperable and secure advanced automation systems to maximize the
   benefits of the IEC 61850 standard. The paper also introduces the
   current results and planned work of the IntelliGrid Architecture,
   developed under a private/public consortium.},

Abstract = {During the life-cycle of constructions various influences induce
   material defects that could affect the behavior of the structural
   system. Therefore, anomalies that affect heavily stressed constructions,
   such as bridges, need to be inspected and evaluated regarding their
   impact on the structural capacity. By using new technologies in the
   field of damage detection, e.g. laser scanners or unmanned aircraft
   systems (UAS), this process can be facilitated. However, the
   classification and assessment of detected anomalies must still be
   performed in a manual way by human experts due to the lack of
   machine-processable evaluation methods. In this paper an approach is
   proposed towards a machine-based damage evaluation, applying semantic
   web technologies on a new developed method for damage detection on
   constructions. Thereby, anomalies are detected based on a large amount
   of highresolution images from which georeferenced point clouds are
   calculated by using photogrammetric methods. Using the geometric
   relations among the image positions and reconstructed points, image
   features such as anomalies are localized on a 3 dimensional surface.
   Based on these image features, a web ontology as semantic representation
   of the recorded damages is generated and linked with an ontology that
   contains information about the affected construction and its
   environment. By using predefined rules based on expert knowledge, the
   detected anomalies are classified and assessed automatically. The
   inferred information is then used to generate damage representations in
   a structural analysis model. Furthermore, the geometrical data, which
   are represented in a model created according to Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) standards, the semantic data as well as the structural
   data are linked by utilizing the Multimodel approach.},

Abstract = {There has been a fundamental shift amongst software developers and
   engineers in the past few years. The software development life cycle
   (SDLC) for a developer has increased in complexity and scale. Changes
   that were developed and deployed over a matter of days or weeks are now
   deployed in a matter of hours. Due to greater availability of compute,
   storage, better tooling, and the necessity to react, developers are
   constantly looking to increase their velocity and throughput of
   developing and deploying changes. Consequently, there is a great need
   for more intelligent and context sensitive DevOps tools and services
   that help developers increase their efficiency while developing and
   debugging. Given the vast amounts of heterogeneous data available from
   the SDLC, such intelligent tools and services can now be built and
   deployed at a large scale to help developers achieve their goals and be
   more productive. In this paper, we present Sankie, a scalable and
   general service that has been developed to assist and impact all stages
   of the modern SDLC. Sankie provides all the necessary infrastructure
   (back-end and front-end bots) to ingest data from repositories and
   services, train models based on the data, and eventually perform
   decorations or provide information to engineers to help increase the
   velocity and throughput of changes, bug fixes etc. This paper discusses
   the architecture as well as some of the key observations we have made
   from wide scale deployment of Sankie within Microsoft.},

Abstract = {Product platforms are commonly used in industries with complex products
   and high competition like the car and truck industry to allow a customer
   to order a product that satisfy its unique needs. A consequence of
   product variety is that manufacturing and assembly processes need to
   deal with this variety as well. If the variety is low and changes of the
   product occur infrequently then the variety may be handled by designing
   the production system for a small set of typical products. But as the
   variety increases and changes become frequent the necessity for
   integrated product and production information model is high, to
   partially solve this problem Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) systems
   aim at providing an integrated model to all categories of users, e.g.
   product designers, product preparation engineers, line builders and
   shop-floor workers. All users need to access the information in the
   platform and refine and modify the information to reflect new knowledge
   that has been acquired. Today, most often multiple systems are used
   where some systems may store information in a structured way but often
   unstructured text documents are also used. This easily results in
   redundant information models and automated analysis is not feasible or
   not event possible because of issues regarding cohesion and traceability
   of information. The contribution in this paper is to discuss how a new
   type of tool for building domain specific languages and editors using
   language workbench approach can be used to support the different user
   categories in their tasks working with variability of a product and
   production system while at the same time provide cohesion and
   traceability of information. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Given the fragmented nature of the architecture, engineering,
   construction, and operation (AECO) industry, building lifecycle
   management (BLM) involves bringing together multidisciplinary teams and
   integrating lifecycle processes of buildings. Despite the increasing use
   of information technologies and software tools by property owners,
   several barriers in BLM implementations remain, such as information
   silos, low data interoperability, poor cross-party coordination, and the
   mismatch of existing commercial solutions and user requirements. To deal
   with these practical challenges, this study develops a BIM-enabled BLM
   system for property owners using a semi-custom approach. For this, a
   three-tier architecture of the BIM-enabled BLM system is designed. Next,
   the system is developed based on a real-life project in the Grid State
   of China. This case scenario verifies the system and further confirmed
   the proposed three-tier architecture. The developed architecture and
   system have theoretical and practical implications for property owners'
   BLM implementations. This proposed semi-custom approach provides
   guidelines for AECO industry digital transformation.},

Abstract = {Phase change materials (PCMs) hold considerable promise for thermal
   energy storage and reduction of temperature swings in building space,
   and can reduce reliance on fossil fuel sources for both heating and
   cooling. Previous studies have evaluated the use of PCMs for energy
   storage and provided some limited information on the embodied energy of
   the PCM; however, an important factor that has not fully been addressed
   until now is the environmental impact of preparation of organic PCMs.
   This study presents life cycle assessments (LCAs) of two organic,
   biosourced PCMs for their applications, focusing on embodied energy and
   CO2 emissions.
   Dodecanoic acid produced from palm kernel oil was considered as a PCM
   for use in a solar thermal water heating application, and ethyl
   hexadecanoate produced from algae was considered for thermal buffering.
   The functional units were defined as 1 t of dodecanoic acid PCM and 1 kg
   of encapsulated ethyl hexadecanoate PCM, respectively. The LCA
   encompasses all phases in the PCM production: growth and harvesting of
   the feedstocks, extraction of the oil, treatment of the oil, and
   separation of singular components. The two PCMs were evaluated in terms
   of the payback times for their embodied energies and embodied CO2 under
   a modeled use phase.
   The energy payback time for dodecanoic acid in a solar thermal
   application was found to be less than 2 years. Although production of
   dodecanoic acid is a net CO2 emitter, use of this PCM in a solar thermal
   system can recoup the CO2 of production in less than a year. Ethyl
   hexadecanoate produced from algae, considered for use in a thermal
   buffering wallboard product, would require at least 30 years of use
   before its energy savings would match its embodied energy, mostly due to
   the drying step in the production of the PCM. However, ethyl
   hexadecanoate is a strong sequester of CO2 at 7.6 t per ton of ethyl
   hexadecanoate.
   Dodecanoic acid produced from palm kernel oil for use in a solar thermal
   hot water system appears to be a viable PCM. Its payback time, both for
   energy and carbon emissions, is under 3 years. On the other hand, the
   high embodied energy of ethyl hexadecanoate produced from algae gives a
   prohibitively long payback time for use in domestic thermal buffering
   applications.},

   study on the methods for modeling knowledge base can help to build
   knowledge base simply and quickly, thus promoting the realization of
   advanced modes of manufacturing. There are two primary issues for
   solutions to develop software, namely software engineering process and
   software engineering process supporting environment. In order to choose
   correct development methods and the corresponding modeling languages,
   object-oriented methodology and structured methodology are discussed in
   detail, and UML and IDEF modeling languages coming from the two
   methodologies respectively are elaborated too. With the development of
   high-speed cutting database, the models and modeling languages needed
   for building engineering knowledge base are given.},

Title = {Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimal lifecycle
   management of complex structures},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A fundamental issue in the development and engineering industries is the
   efficient management of complex structures during their entire
   lifecycles. Traditional fragmented techniques have been used, and this
   has led to instances of poor communication and subpar performance,
   particularly in the context of repair and restoration initiatives.
   Building information modeling (BIM) emerged as a ground-breaking
   strategy that offers a digital representation of a building's attributes
   and facilitates effective collaboration among several stakeholders. The
   current study examines how BIM impacts complex building management
   throughout the course of a structure's existence. It focuses on how BIM
   helps to advance maintenance procedures, environmental initiatives, and
   project effectiveness. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), structural
   equation modeling (SEM), and literature research are the three phases of
   the study's methodology. A thorough investigation was carried out in
   Pakistan's Rawalpindi and Islamabad region utilizing a quantitative
   technique. The poll of 159 participants produced intriguing findings.
   The process of EFA serves to verify constructs and questions, ensuring
   their reliability and validity. On the other hand, SEM is used to assess
   the structural relationships between variables and their impact on BIM
   based lifecycle management. The findings suggest that the application of
   BIM is favorably influenced by each phase of a project, namely Design,
   Construction, Operation and Maintenance, Renovation and Retrofitting,
   and End-of-Life Decisions. This highlights the need to implement a
   complete BIM strategy across all stages of a project's lifespan, which
   may enhance facility management, decrease expenses, and promote
   sustainability. The results of this study have significant consequences
   for professionals and politicians, highlighting the crucial need to
   provide incentives and regulations to promote the use of BIM in building
   projects.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of ships with special consideration of ship
   scrapping},
Journal = {MATERIAUX \& TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Global trade is depending on the seaborne transport of goods. Over two
   thirds of the transport worldwide is carried by ships. After the
   financial crisis in 2008 the worldwide economy experienced turbulences
   which had a direct impact on the volume of trade. All of a sudden there
   was an overcapacity of ships cruising on the oceans of the world. Many
   of the older ships were decommissioned and scrapped. Numerous scrapyards
   are in South Asia, where the ships are dismantled under harsh working
   conditions and with no environmental protection measures. A lot of these
   scrap yards are merely beaches where the ships are beached
   (beach-breaking yards) and disassembled manually. International
   agreements and efforts exist to tackle this kind of end-of-life
   treatment of ships which is dangerous for humans and the environment.
   One example is the Basel Convention to control hazardous waste, to which
   disposed ships also belong. In 2009 the Hong Kong Convention was
   adopted, which aims at reducing the risks to human health, safety and to
   the environment during the recycling of ships. Just recently the
   European Commission has adopted the EU Ship Recycling Regulation to
   reduce the negative impacts linked to the recycling of EU-flagged ships.
   The Regulation sets out a number of requirements for European ships,
   European ship owners and ship recycling facilities. Confronting existing
   challenges of ship scrapping and the international activities to tackle
   these challenges a literature research is performed to assess in what
   way the end-of-life of ships has been covered in LCA studies. Based on
   these findings an own approach to an end-of-life (EoL) assessment is set
   up and illustrated by an example. In order to develop a comprehensive
   assessment of the EoL of cargo ships, a simplified model based on the
   mentioned preexisting information is created. All three phases: ship
   building, ship operation and ship scrapping are taken into account. Two
   scenario groups for the ship scrapping were defined, with different
   approaches to re-use and recycling. The overall contribution of the
   end-of-life phase to the life cycle (construction of the ship, Use, EoL)
   of a ship is ranged and evaluated. The results of the assessed scenarios
   confirm that the re-use and recycling process is environmentally
   preferable. However, the processes and human labour have not been taken
   into account yet. The overall impact on the lifecycle remains negligible
   within the assessed impact categories. A more significant impact of the
   EoL on the lifecycle might be seen if other impact categories, such as
   indicators for resource efficiency are taken into account.},

Abstract = {The rural household biogas program in China has been regarded as an
   effective approach to address energy shortage issues and to reduce
   carbon emission in rural areas. After more than fifty years of
   development, it has neither succeeded in rural energy substitution nor
   achieved other social and environmental goals, although available
   studies have shown otherwise. The reason behind this disparity largely
   lies in inaccurate adoption of the operational cycle, i.e., the fact
   that the actual operational time of the biogas digester was often
   overestimated. Presented In this paper, an EIO-LCA model using the
   Chinese Economic Input-Output table of 2007 was built to estimate
   carbon-dioxide (CO2) emission during the life cycle of a typical 8 m(3)
   household biogas digester and their sources with regard to economic
   sectors. The life cycle of a biogas digester can be divided into three
   stages: construction (including pond building and pen, toilet and stove
   alterations), operation (including maintenance and biogas combustion)
   and disposal. The results show that the net CO2 emission of a biogas
   digester is 1558.91 kg after one year of operation, which corresponds to
   an actual CO2 emission of 2878.30 kg (of which direct and indirect
   emissions are 1558.90 and 1319.40 kg, respectively) and an emission
   reduction by fuel substitution and fertilizer conservation of 1078.59
   and 240.80 kg, respectively. Therefore, the model indicates that a
   biogas digester should be run for at least 2.77 years to have a net CO2
   emission reduction benefit. The model also indicates that comprehensive
   utilization of biogas and its byproducts is very important for carbon
   emission in rural areas. Most of the indirect emissions were derived
   from construction materials, accounting for 88.18\%. Moreover, the
   smelting and pressing of ferrous metals in the 43-step production chain
   of construction materials accounted for 22.48\% of the indirect
   emissions. This gives us a novel perspective to develop emission
   reduction policies. Taken together, the results obtained in this study
   provide substantial information for policy-making on biogas promotion
   and management as well as renewable energy development in rural China.

Title = {3D Land Administration: A Review and a Future Vision in the Context of
   the Spatial Development Lifecycle},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Land Administration practices worldwide rely mainly on 2D-based systems
   to define legal and other spatial boundaries related to land interests.
   However, the built environment is increasingly becoming spatially
   complex. Land administrators are challenged by an unprecedented demand
   to utilise space above and below earth's surface. The relationships
   between people and land in vertical space can no longer be unambiguously
   represented in 2D. In addition, the current societal demand for
   sustainability in a collaborative environment and a lifecycle-thinking,
   is driving the need to integrate independent systems with standalone
   databases and methodologies, associated with different aspects of the
   Spatial Development lifeCycle (SDC). Land Administration Systems (LASs)
   are an important component of the SDC. Today, a LAS is often mandated
   and managed as a domain in isolation. Interaction and data reuse with
   the other phases of the SDC is limited and far from optimal. It is
   expected that effective 3D data collaboration, sharing, and reuse across
   the sectors and disciplines in the lifecycle will enable new ways of
   data harmonisation and use in this complex environment; will improve
   efficiency of design and data acquisition, as well as data quality (in
   relation to specific regulations); and will minimise inconsistencies and
   data loss within information flows. Overall, a cross-sectoral approach
   is directed towards improving the current state of the Land
   Administration (LA) domain. This paper consists of two parts. In the
   first, a review of the current situation, with respect to LASs is
   presented, concluding the needs for improvement in terms of
   effectiveness and consistency. In the second part, the vision for the
   future of LASs is introduced in a wider context, and as an important
   phase in the SDC, with regards to legal, technical, and organisational
   aspects. In this part, the needs and considerations that result from the
   evolving environment and the emerging technological advances are
   addressed, with a view to discussing a cross-sector approach to collect,
   maintain, reuse, and share 3D data. In such a cross-sectoral approach,
   various interoperability issues appear, making it necessary to introduce
   and use standards. In this respect, the ISO 19152:2012 Land
   Administration Domain Model (LADM) in its current Edition I, as well as
   in Edition II (expected in 2022) may serve as the standardised core
   structure of a 3D LAS, with respect to its role as further presented in
   this paper. In parallel, the evolution of the Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) in the design and construction industry, as well as the
   fact that BIM plays a central role in the life cycle of development
   projects, are well recognized. Emphasis is given on feasible reuse of
   BIM/IFC (Industry Foundation Class) data in a 3D LAS. Those
   considerations are addressed through a web-based system architecture for
   a future 3D LAS, thereby attempting to integrate heterogeneous systems
   in the SDC.},

Abstract = {One important need in the construction industry is to visualize the
   project during its life cycle phases, enabling stakeholders to
   change/adjust the project before spending more money for unwanted
   details. Building information modelling (BIM) and 3D laser scanning are
   two examples of rapidly evolving technologies that can help achieve this
   purpose. Researchers are conducting an ongoing study to: (1) determine
   the general knowledge state for these technologies among construction
   project management personnel; (2) determine the benefits and
   shortcomings of these technologies; (3) explore barriers to and enablers
   of these technologies and compare the barriers and enablers with those
   found in earlier studies; and (4) identify awareness and demand statuses
   of using these technologies. The study utilizes a survey questionnaire
   distributed among project management personnel. The research results
   show that there is generally a high level of knowledge about BIM among
   construction management personnel; however, this is not the case with 3D
   laser scanning. BIM and 3D laser scanning help in resolving issues on
   construction jobsites and there is increased demand for using BIM in the
   industry; however, amongst the owners surveyed, there is not as much
   demand for using 3D laser scanning. A lack of experts and high cost are
   the most cited reasons for not using these technologies on a wide range
   of projects. The findings contribute to the knowledge in this research
   area by providing additional information about the current practice
   related to BIM and 3D laser scanning technologies along with evidence of
   the current barriers to further diffusion of the technologies throughout
   the industry.},

Abstract = {Circular economy (CE) offers a pathway towards sustainable, closed-loop
   resource systems, but widespread adoption across industrial sectors is
   limited by fragmented knowledge and varied implementation approaches.
   This article reviews sector-specific challenges and opportunities
   associated with implementing and measuring the benefits of CE
   strategies. Literature mapping highlights progress towards CE
   implementation in food, chemicals, metals, consumer electronics, and
   building and infrastructure sectors, and towards measuring CE outcomes
   via systems analysis methods like life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   material flow analysis (MFA). However, key challenges were also
   identified that point to future research and demonstration needs. First,
   research on CE adoption typically exists as case studies that are
   closely linked to a sector. But literature has not effectively
   synthesized knowledge gained across domains, particularly understanding
   underlying barriers to CE and where they occur in product life cycles.
   Second, research on CE outcomes often applies well-established methods
   without adapting for unique attributes of CE systems. A key opportunity
   is in integrative methodological advances, such as expanded use of
   consequential LCA, development of physical Input-Output tables, and
   integrating MFA with dynamical models. Finally, regardless of sector,
   new CE business models are seen as a critical enabler to realize
   success, but theoretical frameworks in literature are not well-tested in
   practice. The review also highlights opportunities to harness other
   emerging trends, such as big data, to provide better information for
   system modelers and decision-oriented insight to guide CE stakeholders.

Abstract = {Construction is an extremely information-dependent industry in which a
   project's success largely depends on good access to and management of
   data. Effective project management requires the characterization of its
   challenging issues and the use of appropriate tools for data handling.
   For this purpose, the construction industry is increasingly adopting the
   use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in recent years.
   Given the acknowledged potential of ICT to bring about improvements in
   other industries, many initiatives have been undertaken to develop
   appropriate tools to support various tasks during the construction
   project lifecycle. This paper focuses on the proposals that use ICT to
   provide access to the data and take advantage of this access to manage
   crucial issues within project management such as costs, planning, risks,
   safety, progress monitoring, and quality control. The authors will
   demonstrate that suitable data handling facilitates and improves the
   decision-making process and helps to carry out successful project
   management.},

Title = {BIM-Based Methodology for the Management of Public Heritage. CASE Study:
   Algeciras Market Hall},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is modifying the workflow of the
   construction field, not only in design and construction stages but also
   for the management of the facilities. Most advances in academics and
   industry have focussed on the use of BIM for building. However, the
   possibilities of the use of three-dimensional information models for the
   construction and management of public works and civil engineering
   infrastructure projects (known as CIM) are still a matter of concern,
   being complex though offering a wider number of possibilities when
   compared with regular building industry. Moreover, the construction
   process in comparison with its lifespan represent only a small part of
   the investments for the use of public works. With this background, the
   possibilities based on BIM for the maintenance and rehabilitation of
   public heritage (HCIM) can greatly improve traditional management
   capabilities. Making best use of BIM and digitalisation for the
   management of public heritage (HCIM) requires creating tools for
   documentation, registering and data management to permit the adequate
   information transfer between the actors involved. Such actors may be
   experts or not and hold or not skills to use BIM tools. This study
   proposes the creation of a database to support the regular inspection
   during the lifespan of the infrastructure and connect it with the
   three-dimensional information model, serving the latter as an
   information repository of the whole life of the infrastructure. Such
   data include damage and causes as well as a description of the pathology
   and this information is referred to each element, showing all the
   historic measures taken. In addition, quantification and quotation of
   the repairs needed can be obtained. Lastly, the study has applied this
   methodology in Algeciras Market Hall, the notorious rationalist building
   designed by the engineer Eduardo Torroja and built in 1935. The results
   shown in this study can be of great interest for both researchers and
   practice, with an adaptation and innovation of the BIM and HCIM
   possibilities.},

Abstract = {Construction industry adds more than 35 percent of global emissions
   through the entire lifecycle procedure of the structure. Every stage of
   construction process from raw material extraction to demolition is
   responsible for carbon emissions in the form of either embodied or
   operational carbon. Carbon emissions be reduced by implementing
   modernization and sustainability in building design typically with
   greater use of material resources such as recycled steel, recycled
   concrete using the circular economy concepts and automation tools. This
   study focuses on a case of a two-storey commercial structure located in
   Hyderabad, Telangana State in India to ascertain specifically the
   embodied carbon released during different stages of construction using
   standard empirical formulae. Enormous amounts of embodied carbon
   emissions were observed and an alternative approach of using sustainable
   materials such as Ferrock, recycled steel, etc. was proposed to mitigate
   the same. It is evident from the study that eco-friendly materials are
   the effective alternatives to promote carbon neutrality.

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an emerging technology. Its
   application in the refurbishment of building project can significantly
   improve the construction workflows throughout the project lifecycle.
   Despite the promising benefits of BIM adoption for the entire
   Architecture, Engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, this process
   seems to be ambitious due to the highly fragmented nature of
   construction practices, resulting in a difficult integration of diverse
   information throughout the project lifecycle. In the backdrop of recent
   updated research, Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and thorough
   examination of Social Network Analysis (SNA), this research study has
   identified four distinct components comprising refurbishment attributes,
   environmental influence factors, stakeholders' interaction and structure
   optimization to realize BIM on refurbishment projects. Furthermore, it
   posits a conceptual research framework for detailed investigation of
   effective BIM adoption on refurbishment project and strongly advocates
   that the embedded knowledge postulated needs to be actively pursued to
   improve the maximization of the uncovered BIM research for refurbishment
   projects through an extended review investigation. The framework is
   presented as a first step to understand the BIM adoption requirements
   and the real benefits of BIM for all refurbishment stakeholders planning
   to adopt BIM.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to provide a framework for assessing direct soil-water
   consumption, also termed green water in the literature, in life cycle
   assessment (LCA). This was an issue that LCA had not tackled before. The
   approach, which is applied during the life cycle inventory phase (LCI),
   consists of quantifying the net change in the evapo(transpi)ration of
   the production system compared to the natural reference situation.
   Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is used as the natural reference
   situation. In order to apply the method, we estimated PNV
   evapotranspiration adapted to local biogeographic conditions, on global
   dry lands, where soil-water consumption impacts can be critical. Values
   are reported at different spatial aggregation levels: 10-arcmin global
   grid, ecoregions (501 units), biomes (14 units), countries (124 units),
   continents, and a global average, to facilitate the assessment for
   different spatial information detail levels available in the LCI. The
   method is intended to be used in rain-fed agriculture and rainwater
   harvesting contexts, which includes direct soil moisture uptake by
   plants and rainwater harvested and then reused in production systems.
   The paper provides the necessary LCI method and data for further
   development of impact assessment models and characterization factors to
   evaluate the environmental effects of the net change in
   evapo(transpOration.},

Abstract = {BIM models are transforming the way buildings or, in more general terms,
   facilities or infrastructures are conceived, designed, constructed and
   managed. But current use of BIM concentrates on preplanning, design,
   construction and project delivery rather than maintenance and operation
   management. This despite the fact that it is estimated that operation
   and maintenance phase constitutes approximately 60\% of the total
   lifecycle cost of a facility or building. Asset Management, which is a
   broad discipline including Facilities Management (FM), provide an
   advance approach getting more efficiency and efficacy in the lifecycle
   management of building and facilities. This paper introduces how the
   development of AM in this particular field is going to be supported by
   the application of BIM models as key tool that will allow asset
   management information system effective implementation. (C) 2016, IFAC

Abstract = {In this study, it is tried to provide an estimation of damages imposed
   to a prototype office building as a result of earthquake occurrence. For
   this purpose, first a model is developed in BIM and then its properties
   are exported to a structural analysis software (opensees) in order to
   evaluate the structure's response under specific loading condition.
   Next, the outcome of opensees is used to identify the building's Damage
   State (DS). Then, the associated costs with each damage state are
   estimated by Performance Assessment Calculation Tool (PACT) provided by
   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Finally, a Life Cycle
   Environmental Assessment is performed to identify the environmental
   impacts of the damages imposed to the building as a result of
   earthquake. For this purpose, embodied energy of the building is
   calculated and then based on the damage probability, the total embodied
   energy losses are calculated. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Sustainable building design has become a hot topic over the past
   decades. Many standards, databases, and tools have been developed for
   achieving a sustainable building. Not until recently have the importance
   of structural engineering and its contribution to sustainable building
   design been full recognised. However, due to the highly fragmented and
   diversity of knowledge across building and infrastructure domains, there
   is a lack of approach that can address all the sustainable issues within
   the structural design. This paper reviews the sustainable design from
   the perspective of structural engineering: (1) reviewing the current
   situation; (2) identifying the gaps and difficulties; and (3) making
   recommendations for future improvements. The strategies and indicators,
   as well as BIM-enabled methodology, for sustainable structural design
   (SSD) are also discussed in a holistic way. The results of this
   investigation show that most of the methods are not doing well in terms
   of delivering a successful sustainable structural design. It is expected
   that the future BIM could probably provide such a platform to address
   these issues.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present an application of 6D building
   information modelling (6D BIM) on a real business-storage building in
   Slovenia. First, features of building maintenance in general are
   described according to the current Slovenian legislation, and also a
   general principle of BIM is given. After that, step-by-step activities
   for modelling 6D BIM are exposed, namely from Element list for
   maintenance, determination of their lifetime and service measures, cost
   analysing and time analysing to 6D BIM modelling. The presented 6D BIM
   model is designed in a unique way in which cost analysis is performed as
   5D BIM model with linked data to use BIM Construction Project Management
   Software (Vico Office), integrated with 3D BIM model, whereas time
   analysis as 4D BIM model is carried out as non-linked data with the help
   of Excel (without connection to 3D BIM model). The paper is intended to
   serve as a guide to the building owners to prepare 6D BIM and to provide
   an insight into the relevant dynamic information about intervals and
   costs for execution of maintenance works in the whole building
   lifecycle.},

Abstract = {Traction batteries are a key factor in the environmental sustainability
   of electric mobility and, therefore, it is necessary to evaluate their
   environmental performance to allow a comprehensive sustainability
   assessment of electric mobility. This article presents an environmental
   assessment of a lithium-ion traction battery for plug-in hybrid electric
   vehicles, characterized by a composite cathode material of lithium
   manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide
   Li(NixCoyMn1-x-y)O-2. Composite cathode material is an emerging
   technology that promises to combine the merits of several active
   materials into a hybrid electrode to optimize performance and reduce
   costs. In this study, the environmental assessment of one battery pack
   (with a nominal capacity of 11.4 kWh able to be used for about 140,000
   km of driving) is carried out by using the Life Cycle Assessment
   methodology consistent with ISO 14040. The system boundaries are the
   battery production, the operation phase and recycling at the end of
   life, including the recovery of various material fractions. The
   composite cathode technology examined besides a good compromise between
   the higher and the lower performance of NMC and LMO cathodes, can
   present good environmental performances.
   The results of the analysis show that the manufacturing phase is
   relevant to all assessed impact categories (contribution higher than
   60\%). With regard to electricity losses due to battery efficiency and
   battery transport, the contribution to the use phase impact of battery
   efficiency is larger than that of battery transport. Recycling the
   battery pack contributes less than 11\% to all of the assessed impact
   categories, with the exception of freshwater ecotoxicity (60\% of the
   life cycle impact). The environmental credits related to the recovery of
   valuable materials (e.g. cobalt and nickel sulphates) and other metal
   fractions (e.g. aluminium and steel) are particularly relevant to impact
   categories such as marine eutrophication, human toxicity and abiotic
   resource depletion.
   The main innovations of this article are that (1) it presents the first
   bill of materials of a lithium-ion battery cell for plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles with a composite cathode active material; (2) it
   describes one of the first applications of the life cycle assessment to
   a lithium-ion battery pack for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a
   composite cathode active material with the aim of identifying the ``hot
   spots{''} of this technology and providing useful information to battery
   manufacturers on potentially improving its environmental sustainability;
   (3) it evaluates the impacts associated with the use phase based on
   primary data about the battery pack's lifetime, in terms of kilometres
   driven; and (4) it models the end-of-life phase of the battery
   components through processes specifically created for or adapted to the
   case study. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

   has been hitting the shores of Malaysian construction industry. The
   unprecedented change it brings to the design responsibilities of
   construction professionals in Malaysia has led to a pre-emptive
   strategic focus for Quantity Surveying (QS) profession. The QS
   profession adheres to the 5th dimension of BIM, which invariably
   translates to the context of costing, offering the capability to
   generate quantity take-off counts and measurement directly from a model.
   BIM digitalized data lead to accurate automated estimation which reduces
   variability in cost estimation. From the academic point of view,
   requirements to meet this paradigm shift to BIM requires an enhancement
   to the existing set of skills and knowledge available in Malaysian
   institutions of higher learning. The promotion of BIM educational
   framework for the QS graduates have been professional body led. This is
   carried out by the Royal Institution of Surveyors Malaysia (RISM) which
   has been actively involved in establishing the educational framework
   which in turn has been referred to by the higher institutions that
   offers quantity surveying program. This paper describes the educational
   framework for the QS in the context of BIM implementation that charts a
   route on how knowledge on BIM principles and its application can be
   imparted to the whole-life interdisciplinary design and construction
   with prime focus on the QS scope of work. The primary aim of the
   framework lies in equipping QS graduates with the necessary skills in
   project delivery through the use of BIM by focusing on four spheres of
   attainment level and two different level of knowledge acquisition.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) to improve projects'
   efficiency, starts to be a well-known practice, advocated by many
   governments. Despite the increasing interest among researchers in the
   use of BIM for managing end-of-life (EOL) activities, practitioners are
   still doubtful. Moreover, the potential of BIM to facilitate circular
   economy (CE) adoption is a research area still in its infancy. An
   extensive literature review was conducted to explore how BIM is used
   throughout the asset lifecycle and what are the various BIM dimensions.
   Then, an inductive and qualitative survey, using semi-structured
   interviews was conducted. The aim of this research was to present the
   various BIM models developed throughout the asset lifecycle in the
   context of CE and to define what the content of the deconstruction
   information model (DIM) could be. Based on the qualitative analysis of
   the data, three types of findings present the practitioners' views.
   First, a process illustrates the sustainable EOL in the context of BIM
   and CE. Secondly, the three models created throughout the asset
   lifecycle are presented. Lastly, the content of the model proposed for
   the management of the EOL activities is detailed. Conclusively, an
   eighth dimension is proposed associated with the EOL activities and
   further areas of research are suggested.},

   when complementary workflows such as building scanning {[}3]. Fast
   development and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities
   arise from process automation and BIM adaptation for existing buildings'
   requirements {[}1]. To aid decision-making, building simulation is
   widely used in the late design stages, but its application is still
   limited in the early stages in which design decisions have a major

Abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) are integrated object models of
   building projects developed by the International Alliance for
   Interoperability (IAI). The IFCs support data sharing and exchange
   between industry processes across multiple domains such as architecture,
   structural engineering, building services, construction and facilities
   management (FM).
   Maintenance management is one of the major functions in FM. It requires
   object information about building systems and components that are
   generated from different domain processes throughout different stages of
   the project development life cycle. Supported by the IFCs, this
   information can remain available until the building operation phase for
   maintenance processes to use. However, this information requirement must
   be defined based on detailed analysis of maintenance processes, and must
   be modeled using a formal modeling methodology, that is, the IFCs.
   This paper describes the current and proposed developments in facilities
   management in the IAI, particularly for maintenance. It also discusses a
   planning `roadmap' that identifies discrete packages of information that
   support FM processes.
   The paper demonstrates a general maintenance process model developed to
   define the object requirements and interfaces for sharing maintenance
   information. Based on the process information analysis, the paper
   develops and presents a set of IFC object models that support the
   maintenance processes. Additionally, this paper discusses the
   necessities and capabilities of the IFC maintenance objects to access
   and utilize external information provided by various library resources.},

Abstract = {The imperative to reduce atmospheric carbon is well documented and one
   significant area of production is from the built form which is
   responsible for up to 40\% of global energy consumption and 30\% of the
   world's carbon emissions (UNEP, 2009). Over the full life cycle of
   buildings, which includes construction and demolition, 80-90\% of this
   energy is used during the operational phase to heat, cool, ventilate,
   light and run appliances (ibid). The balance of 10-20\% represents the
   embodied energy and is consumed during the building process of
   construction and production of the raw materials themselves (ibid). The
   embodied energy proportion varies considerably according to the life
   expectancy of the building. This proportion of the overall emissions
   will increase as the life span decreases and in the context of mine site
   village development is certainly on the higher side as most sites have a
   life span of less than 20 years. The need for the transport of goods and
   services, delivery of water and waste services to and from buildings
   adds further to account of emissions that the built form is responsible
   for and the total can be described as the carbon footprint. Measuring
   this and reducing it to a point of carbon neutrality is the overall aim
   of our research.
   The term `carbon neutral' has been defined largely by popular usage in
   the past (Murray and Dey, 2007). Even within scientific literature the
   academic definitions are few and varied, despite a raft of papers on
   life cycle analysis, input and output methods and tools for carbon
   accounting, especially when considering which emissions of the built
   form life cycle are actually to be included (Wiedmann and Minx, 2008).
   Murray and Dev (2007) discuss the terms `carbon neutral' and `carbon
   footprint' with several references on the subject. One such, Wiedmann
   and Minx (2008) concludes that a carbon footprint should only include
   CO2 and no other greenhouse gases (GHG) from indirect, upstream
   emissions, as well as direct onsite emissions. In contrast, and in the
   context of this paper, the calculation of the carbon footprint is
   regarded as comprising of all the carbon emissions from the complete
   life cycle of the mine site village that can reasonably be calculated,
   from a clear site for development through to the remediation of the site
   following removal or demolition. Determining which emissions can
   `reasonably' be included and how they are calculated will determine the
   potential applicability of the model to mine site village development
   generally.
   A specific case study has been secured of a recently constructed mine
   site village in the heart of the Western Australia's Pilbara region
   built to accommodate 142 staff with an anticipated occupancy rate of
   80\%. This paper details the methodology employed to calculate the total
   carbon emissions, the carbon footprint of this purpose built village and
   how to reduce it effectively to a point where carbon neutrality can be
   claimed. A conceptual model has been developed for calculating the
   emissions and is represented schematically in the paper with explanation
   of its parts. Once the carbon account, the overall footprint, is known
   then the task of building a strategy for reduction can commence. This
   will include: reduction of the embodied energy of construction;
   implementation of operational energy efficiency measures; renewable
   energy system offsets; and accredited biomass and carbon offset of the
   remaining emissions.
   In respect of operational energy measurement data has been provided from
   a similar sized village which highlighted the major energy consuming
   circuits and systems. Consequently, the Pilbara village has been
   designed by electrical engineers according to this data and once in full
   operation needs to be verified. To achieve this a metering and remote
   sensing system has been designed and installed on site to measure these
   circuits and systems, some detail of which follows in the methodology
   section of this paper. The system is expected to provide substantial
   information which, once analysed, will provide a basis upon which to
   redesign the power generation and distribution systems throughout the
   village and make a definite contribution to the overall operational
   energy reduction strategy.},

Abstract = {Healthcare is confronted with increasing costs and complexity,
   population ageing and pandemics. In this context, effective cooperation
   and interoperability of the healthcare effort participants and their
   information systems is paramount but often hindered by the typically
   hierarchical and heterogeneous character of healthcare institutions. In
   the new context, governments can no longer apply traditional healthcare
   information and organisational paradigms. Novel holistic and integrated
   models are required, taking into account aspects, elements and life
   cycles of all healthcare effort participants. Building on previous
   research and applications, this paper employs conceptual development and
   case study to create a modelling framework drawing on information
   systems, interoperability, collaborative networks and enterprise
   architecture disciplines in order to build the artefacts required for
   truly collaborative healthcare information systems. It is found that
   this multi-faceted approach provides a feasible theoretical and
   practical platform for sustainable collaborative information systems

Abstract = {This paper provides a summary of an energy benchmarking study that uses
   performance data of a sample of Information Technology facilities in
   Bangalore. Information provided by the sample of occupiers was used to
   develop an Energy Performance Index (EPI) and an Annual Average hourly
   Energy Performance Index (AAhEPI), which takes into account the
   variations in operation hours and days for these facilities. The EPI and
   AAhEPI were modelled to identify the factors that influence energy
   efficiency. Employment density, size of facility, operating hours per
   week, type of chiller and age of facility were found to be significant
   factors in regression models with ER! and AAhEPI as dependent variables.
   Employment density, size of facility and operating hours per week were
   standardised and used in a separate regression analysis. Parameter
   estimates from this regression were used to normalize the EN and AAhEPI
   for variance in the independent variables. Three benchmark ranges - the
   bottom third, middle third and top third were developed for the two
   normalised indices. The normalised EPI and AAhEPI of LEED rated
   building, which were also part of the sample, indicate that, on average,
   LEED rated buildings outperform the other buildings. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the last decades, the use of information management systems in the
   building data processing led to radical changes to the methods of data
   production, documentation and archiving. In particular, the
   possibilities, given by these information systems, to visualize the 3D
   model and to formulate queries have placed the question of the
   information sharing in digital format. The integration of information
   systems represents an efficient solution for defining smart, sustainable
   and resilient projects, such as conservation and restoration processes,
   giving the possibilities to combine heterogeneous data. GIS provides a
   robust data storage system, a definition of topological and semantic
   relationships and spatial queries. 3D GIS makes possible the creation of
   three-dimensional model in a geospatial context. To promote the
   interoperability of GIS data, the present research aims first to analyse
   methods of conversion in CityGML and IndoorGML model, defining an
   ontological domain. This has led to the creation of a new enriched
   model, based on connections among the different elements of the urban
   model in GIS environment, and to the possibility to formulate queries
   based on these relations. The second step consists in collecting all
   data translated into a specific format that fill a graph database in a
   semantic web environment, while maintaining those relationships. The
   semantic web technology represents an efficient tool of interoperability
   that leaves open the possibility to import BIM data in the same graph
   database and to join both GIS and BIM models. The outcome will offer
   substantial benefits during the entire project life cycle. This
   methodology can also be applied to cultural heritage where the
   information management plays a key role.},

Abstract = {This study is to present the concept and design of recommendation system
   for the green products. The proposed system mainly provides two
   functions in green product information sharing. One of them is to
   support designers and specialists to clarify the concept of a product by
   building up the green life cycle model. The other role is to serve as a
   green recommender for the consumers. It collects and displays the green
   levels of the product on the internet and recommends consumers the
   appropriate green products by the product ingredient and the consumers'
   green preference. Through the recommendation mechanism, the proposed
   green recommender may provide proper information of the green products
   for both the companies and the customers. The proposed concept is
   described by an illustrative example.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is progressively being adopted for
   precast construction as it facilitates efficient design, manufacturing
   and construction through generation and management of the virtual models
   incorporating both the physical attributes and functional behavior.
   Several studies have addressed the application of BIM for precast
   construction; however, these studies have focused on specific areas in
   the precast project lifecycle such as construction and inventory
   management. This study focuses on the systematic review of the potential
   applications of BIM through the entire precast project lifecycle. The
   stages in the lifecycle considered are ``Concept,{''} ``Design,{''}
   ``Planning,{''} ``Production,{''} ``Logistics,{''} and
   ``Erection/Construction{''} which are similar to stages of a
   manufactured product. This study reviews past work in the domain and
   identifies areas for future work. The benefits and shortcomings of BIM
   application are evaluated based on the needs of each area and the
   features available in current BIM software. This paper provides a
   detailed review of the state-of-art of BIM application for precast
   construction lifecycle and potential for integrated BIM implementation
   in practice.},

Title = {Object-Oriented Damage Information Modeling Concepts and Implementation
   for Bridge Inspection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Bridges are designed to last for more than 50 years and consume up to
   50\% of their life-cycle costs during their operation phase. Several
   inspections and assessment actions are executed during this period.
   Bridge and damage information must be gathered, digitized, and exchanged
   between different stakeholders. Currently, the inspection and assessment
   practices rely on paper-based data collection and exchange, which is
   time-consuming and error-prone, and leads to loss of information.
   Storing and exchanging damage and building information in a digital
   format may lower costs and errors during inspection and assessment and
   support future needs, for example, immediate simulations regarding
   performance assessment, automated maintenance planning, and mixed
   reality inspections. This study focused on the concept for modeling
   damage information to support bridge reviews and structural analysis.
   Starting from the definition of multiple use cases and related
   requirements, the data model for damage information is defined
   independently from the subsequent implementation. In the next step, the
   implementation via an established standard is explained. Functional
   tests aim to identify problems in the concept and implementation. To
   show the capability of the final model, two example use cases are
   illustrated: the inspection review of the entire bridge and a
   finite-element analysis of a single component. Main results are the
   definition of necessary damage data, an object-oriented damage model,
   which supports multiple use cases, and the implementation of the model
   in a standard. Furthermore, the tests have shown that the standard is
   suitable to deliver damage information; however, several software
   programs lack proper implementation of the standard.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Circular business models, aimed at narrowing, slowing, and closing
   resource loops, can potentially generate significant economic and social
   benefits, promote resource security and improve environmental
   performance. However, within the wind power industry, sustainability
   research, including life cycle assessments, has been focused mostly on
   technology innovation at the material (e.g. permanent magnets),
   components (e.g. blades) or product level (e.g. new assets). Research
   analysing the implementation of circular business models in the wind
   industry is scarce. Such information could, however, support more robust
   decision-making in the development of system-level innovations for the
   deployment of more resource-efficient and sustainable wind energy
   infrastructure. Building upon practical methods for the identification,
   categorisation and characterisation of business models, 14 circular
   business models with application to the wind industry were
   comprehensively evaluated through the revision of 125 documents,
   including 56 journal papers, 46 industrial business cases and 23 wind
   technology management reports. Each circular business model is examined
   according to i) business offering and drivers, ii) value creation,
   delivery and capture mechanisms, iii) sustainability benefits and
   trade-offs, and iv) industrial challenges and opportunities.
   Accordingly, comprehensive guidelines to drive political (legislation
   design and implementation), industrial (technology and business
   innovation) and academic (further research) actions, are provided.
   Though the results are focussed on the wind industry, the general
   findings and recommendations are relevant across the renewable and
   low-carbon energy sector.},

Journal = {TRANSACTIONS IN GIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-113},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Current land administration systems mainly use 2D plans to define and
   secure ownership rights associated with properties in high-rise
   buildings. These 2D plans may not effectively communicate and manage the
   spatial complexity associated with multi-layered and stacked properties
   in such buildings; additionally, multiple pages of plans (representing
   sections of the building) are required to represent all ownership
   boundaries. In response, land administration organizations have been
   investigating a 3D digital approach to managing information about
   ownership rights in high-rise building structures. In this article,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) is proposed as a feasible approach
   for managing land and property information in high-rise buildings. BIM
   provides a collaborative, digital and intelligent 3D data environment
   for managing building information throughout the lifecycle of buildings.
   However, there is currently no capacity in BIM for recording and
   representing information about ownership and boundaries of properties,
   which is core land administration information. Therefore, this article
   proposes an extension to the BIM standard, which is implemented in a
   prototype BIM model of a complex building to showcase the potential
   capability of using BIM for high-rise land administration and for
   modeling 3D ownership rights.},

Title = {Building waste management core indicators through Spatial Material Flow
   Analysis: Net recovery and transport intensity indexes},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2496-2510},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper, the material and spatial characterization of the flows
   within a municipal solid waste (MSW) management system are combined
   through a Network-Based Spatial Material Flow Analysis. Using this
   information, two core indicators are developed for the bio-waste
   fraction, the Net Recovery Index (NRI) and the Transport Intensity Index
   (TII), which are aimed at assessing progress towards policy-related
   sustainable MSW management strategies and objectives. The NFU approaches
   the capacity of a MSW management system for converting waste into
   resources through a systematic metabolic approach, whereas the TII
   addresses efficiency in terms of the transport requirements to manage a
   specific waste flow throughout the entire MSW management life cycle.
   Therefore, both indicators could be useful in assessing key MSW
   management policy strategies, such as the consecution of higher
   recycling levels (sustainability principle) or the minimization of
   transport by locating treatment facilities closer to generation sources
   (proximity principle). To apply this methodological approach, the
   bio-waste management system of the region of Catalonia (Spain) has been
   chosen as a case study. Results show the adequacy of both indicators for
   identifying those points within the system with higher capacity to
   compromise its environmental, economic and social performance and
   therefore establishing clear targets for policy prioritization.
   Moreover, this methodological approach permits scenario building, which
   could be useful in assessing the outcomes of hypothetical scenarios,
   thus proving its adequacy for strategic planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Dynamic electronic product information is one of the crucial drivers for
   future e-Work and e-Procurement in the Construction Industry.
   Manufacturers are not economically motivated, especially SMEs, to meet
   industry requirements for detailed quality product information. Lack of
   structure and standards, fragmentation, heterogeneous nature of the
   information and incompatible semantics contribute largely to this
   situation. The push for innovation in this area needs to come from the
   industry if global searches and comparative analysis based on product
   properties is to be possible. The eProCon (Electronic Product
   Information in Construction) project, funded by the Nordic Industrial
   fund, aims to develop and implement an infrastructure, technology and
   business models for presenting information about building products that
   will enable e-Work in building design and construction and e-Procurement
   of building products while at the same time allow manufacturers to
   maintain their distinctive market values and differentiating product
   characteristics. This should allow construction professionals to easily
   find products matching technical properties, exchanging information
   about them between computer systems, re-using the information in design
   and business applications and thereby, improve building product
   life-cycle information management and integrate supply chain activities.
   The paper will give an overview of the eProCon project, its rationale,
   background and approach.},

Title = {Influence of key role players on productivity outcomes in the
   residential building lifecycle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {528-551},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to answer the `what' and `how' questions about
   the key role players' influence on the overall productivity outcomes in
   the lifecycle of residential buildings procured through the traditional
   route.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mix of exploratory and descriptive
   research methods was used to obtain feedback from 179 role-players
   involved in various phases of the residential building lifecycle (RBLC)
   in New Zealand. Empirical data were analysed using content analysis,
   multi-attribute method and Friedman's two-way analysis of variance.
   Findings - Results showed that designers, building owners, main
   contractors and project managers were the greatest influencers of the
   productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The priority drivers of these key
   role-players' influences on the RBLC productivity outcomes comprised
   poor brief interpretation, inclination to lowest tender, inadequate
   prior risk analysis and miscommunication of owner's requirements and
   preferences to service providers, respectively. By taking proactive
   steps to redress their productivity inhibiting acts/omissions as
   identified in this study, the various role-players could contribute to
   significant improvement of productivity outcomes in the building
   lifecycle.
   Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to interview all
   participants that made up the representative random samples from each
   role-player group due largely to workload related excuses. As a result,
   the findings and the conclusions may not be generalised beyond the study
   scope. However, the study achieved its purpose, as the main intent was
   to provide hypothetical constructs that could guide further
   confirmatory/experimental studies for residential buildings as well as
   for other building types.
   Practical implications - A succinct and easy-to-follow model was
   developed as implementation pathway for operationalising the key
   findings of the study in the industry. The model highlights the
   Owner-Architect-Contractor Influence Triangle (OACIT) as the 20 per cent
   of the solutions that could deliver 80 per cent of the productivity
   improvement in the RBLC.
   Originality/value - This study re-examines productivity issues not only
   from a life-cycle perspective but also from the perspectives of the
   majority of the key role-players. In addition, the OACIT concept offers
   a novel productivity improvement tool; it stresses that productivity in
   the traditionally procured building lifecycle could be optimised if the
   architect could focus greater attention on brief articulation and the
   issuance and review of design and specification information. Also, the
   owner should adopt productivity-enhancing procurement and contract
   strategies and emphasise more on value-addition and less on lowest
   tender price.},

Title = {Optimizing Incentive Policy of Energy-Efficiency Retrofit in Public
   Buildings: A Principal-Agent Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {The building sector consumes most energy in the world, especially public
   buildings, which normally have high energy-use intensity. This
   phenomenon indicates that the energy-efficiency retrofit (EER) for
   public buildings is essential for energy saving. Incentive policies have
   been emphasized by governments in recent years, but their effectiveness
   has not been sufficient. A major reason is agency problems in EER and
   that the government and building owners have asymmetric information.
   Furthermore, most policies apply identical standard to existing
   buildings of different types, resulting in resistance from owners and
   tenants. To mitigate this issue, this study proposes a principal-agent
   model to optimize incentive policy in EER. The proposed model defines
   two pairs of principal-agent relations (i.e., the government-owner and
   owner-tenant) and models their behaviors under different scenarios as
   per principal-agent theory. The results indicate the optimal incentive
   policies for different scenarios. In addition, critical factors of
   policy making, such as cost, risk, uncertainty, and benefit distribution
   are discussed. This study has implications for policy that will benefit
   policy makers, particularly in promoting EER by mitigating the agency
   problem found for the different scenarios.},

Title = {Unsupervised data analytics in mining big building operational data for
   energy efficiency enhancement: A review},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {296-308},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Building operations account for the largest proportion of energy use
   throughout the building life cycle. The energy saving potential is
   considerable taking into account the existence of a wide variety of
   building operation deficiencies. The advancement in information
   technologies has made modern buildings to be not only energy-intensive,
   but also information-intensive. Massive amounts of building operational
   data, which are in essence the reflection of actual building operating
   conditions, are available for knowledge discovery. It is very promising
   to extract potentially useful insights from big building operational
   data, based on which actionable measures for energy efficiency
   enhancement are devised.
   Data mining is an advanced technology for analyzing big data. It
   consists of two main types of data analytics, i.e., supervised and
   unsupervised analytics. Despite of the power of supervised analytics in
   predictive modeling, unsupervised analytics are more practical and
   promising in discovering novel knowledge given limited prior knowledge.
   This paper provides a comprehensive review on the current utilization of
   unsupervised data analytics in mining massive building operational data.
   The commonly used unsupervised analytics are summarized according to
   their knowledge representations and applications. The challenges and
   opportunities are elaborated as guidance for future research in this
   multi-disciplinary field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM), integrated with innovative
   visualization technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual
   Reality (VR), can provide a holistic and system-driven approach at every
   stage of the building life cycle. The Architectural, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, relative to other industries, has been slow
   in adopting AR/VR technologies, partly due to a lack of feasibility
   studies examining the actual cost of implementation versus an increase
   in profit. AR and VR have the potential to improve projects' overall
   performance, simplify construction processes, and boost stakeholder
   collaboration. However, there is still a lack of proper understanding of
   how well such new technologies have been adopted, how much time and cost
   can be saved, and what limitations do users have. This paper aims to
   explore the current level of understanding of AR/VR technologies
   adoption in the AEC industry. To investigate the adoption of AR/VR at
   the company level, implementation in projects, benefits, and obstacles
   of using AR/VR, a survey is distributed to the AEC industry
   professionals across the United States. Responses from 158 industry
   experts as well as academic researchers are evaluated to assess the
   current state, growth, and saving opportunities of AR/VR technologies in
   the AEC industry.},

   functions. This framework is designed to run fully automated, gaining
   and managing all required information. Thereby, only little engineering
   effort is required and the framework is able to scale with the
   complexity of the plant structure. This is realized by mapping different
   plant situations to simplified and unified situations in real time. The
   modular layers decouple semantically differing tasks and the
   corresponding information from each other, which makes the framework
   modular and thus open to plug in new plant elements to be considered,
   new or changing plant properties or new diagnosis or asset management
   functionality.
   The framework presented here is already implemented in a German BP
   refinery, realizing a completely automated pump monitoring application.},

   as QCEPM (Quantitative Carbon Emission Prediction Model) by conducting
   multiple linear regression analysis using the quantities of concrete,
   rebar, and masonry structures as independent variables and the embodied
   carbon emissions of a building as the dependent variable. We processed
   the data in the detailed quantity list of 20 multi-story frame structure
   buildings and fed them to the QCEPM for the solution. Comparison of the
   QCEPM-calculated results against the time-consuming and error-prone
   manual calculation results suggested a mean absolute percentage error
   (MAPE) of 2.36\%. Using this simplified model, regulatory bodies can
   efficiently supervise the embodied carbon emissions in multi-story frame
   structures by setting up a carbon quota for a project in its approval
   stage, allowing the construction enterprise to carry out dynamic control
   over the three most important audited building materials throughout a
   project's planning and implementation phase.},

Abstract = {There are many common challenges to integrate and share information
   resources in enterprise or industrial environment, for example,
   heterogeneous structure of data sources, dynamical changing of source
   location and schema, sharing information across multiple autonomous
   administrative domains, fine-grained access control, and personalized
   requirements. Although it is possible to build a specialized solution to
   meet any scenario requirements, the solution, which is very suitable to
   the specialized scenario, may not be available to other scenarios. Based
   on Wet, Services technology, Vega Information Grid (VIG) abstracts
   commonality of requirements and addresses these issues by information
   virtualization. A suite of toolkit, which provides functionalities
   suitable for different scenarios, enables enterprise users to acquire
   and deploy information cost-effectively in a virtual grid platform, and
   to benefit greatly form the decrease of thefull life cycle time and the
   cost of management and changes of sharing information. This paper
   introduces its information virtualization model based relation schema,
   and decoupled architecture supporting personalized utilization pattern.},

Title = {A decision tree-based modeling approach for evaluating the green
   performance of airport buildings},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {100},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Airport buildings can significantly impact the environment throughout
   their life cycle. With over 40,000 existing numbers worldwide, airport
   buildings pose a serious threat that is unacknowledged either in the
   built envi-ronment or the aviation sector. This gap along with the lack
   of specific frameworks highlights the need for more airport-based
   research on green building performance assessments and the development
   of airport-specific green building rating tools (GBRT). This research
   aims to develop a decision tree-based modeling approach for eval-uating
   the green performance of airport buildings. Information from publicly
   available airport communications such as sustainability, environment,
   corporate social responsibility, and annual reports are utilized to
   create an environmental dataset with 17 environmental features.
   Structured web-mining and content analysis approaches are followed to
   build the dataset comprising 577 report information. The Classification
   and Regression Tree (CART) model is preferred for the supervised
   learning exercise due to its high-performing ability with scarce data
   and easier interpretability of its results by airport stakeholders. The
   CART model resulted in the development of 49 green rules that are of
   practical use to airport operators towards their built environment
   management relating to the environmental categories of GBRT. The
   developed CART model exhibits useful and justifiable inter-relationships
   between features that are previously unobserved in any GBRTs.},

   through Building Information Modeling: A Case Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2017},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reducing carbon emissions and addressing environmental policies in the
   construction domain has been intensively explored with solutions ranging
   from energy efficiency techniques with building informatics to user
   behavior modelling and monitoring. Such strategies have managed to
   improve current practices in managing buildings, however decarbonizing
   the built environment and reducing the energy performance gap remains a
   complex undertaking that requires more comprehensive and sustainable
   solutions. In this context, building information modelling (BIM), can
   help the sustainability agenda as the digitalization of product and
   process information provides a unique opportunity to optimize
   energy-efficiency-related decisions across the entire lifecycle and
   supply chain. BIM is foreseen as a means to waste and emissions
   reduction, performance gap minimization, in-use energy enhancements, and
   total lifecycle assessment. It also targets the whole supply chain
   related to design, construction, as well as management and use of
   facilities, at the different qualifications levels (including
   blue-collar workers). In this paper, we present how building information
   modelling can be utilized to address energy efficiency in buildings in
   the operation phase, greatly contributing to achieving carbon emissions
   targets. In this paper, we provide two main contributions: (i) we
   present a BIM-oriented methodology for supporting building energy
   optimization, based on which we identify few training directions with
   regards to BIM, and (ii) we provide an application use case as
   identified in the European research project ``Sporte2{''} to demonstrate
   the advantages of BIM in energy efficiency with respect to several
   energy metrics.},

Abstract = {The realization of smart and energetically efficient buildings is
   contingent upon the successful implementation of two tasks that occur on
   distinct phases of the building life cycle: in the design and subsequent
   retrofitting phases, the selection and implementation of an effective
   energy concept, and, during the operation phase, the actuation of energy
   systems to ensure parsimonious energy use while retaining acceptable
   end-user thermal comfort. Operational efficiencies are achieved through
   the use of Building Energy Management Systems tasked to deliver core
   Sense, Think, Act (STA) functionalities: Sense, using sensing modalities
   installed in the building; Think, utilizing, typically a rule-based
   decision system; and Act, by sending actuation commands to controllable
   building elements. Providing the intelligence in this STA process can be
   a formidable task due to the complex interplay of many systems and
   occurrence of disturbances. In this article, an architectural and
   algorithmic framework is presented to provide streamlined implementation
   of this process. Important ingredients in this framework are: (S) a data
   access component capable of collecting and aggregating information from
   a number of heterogeneous sources (sensors, weather stations, weather
   forecasts); (T) a model-based optimization methodology to generate
   intelligent operational decisions; and (A) an assessment and actuation
   component. An illustrative application of the proposed methodology in an
   office building is provided.},

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the way we
   work and play. Such changes are evident in the design, construction and
   operation of large construction projects. Programs such as building
   information modelling (BIM) and various other innovative digital
   technologies and engineering systems are changing the way we materialise
   all aspects of construction projects. This proliferation of ICT and
   digital technologies facilitated the adoption of various innovative
   approaches in processes and various ICT systems throughout a project
   life-cycle and across its supply chain. This has great implication on
   construction firms providing a new challenge by reconfiguring their
   resources to rise to the new challenges of large construction projects.
   ICT is changing three different aspects of large scale projects. As a
   tool during the build, i.e. BIM, for the ongoing building functionality
   i.e. BMS and lastly benefiting occupants experience. The integration of
   these three ICT aspects are forcing firms to rethink their current ICT
   management systems. Through a case study in a large scale healthcare
   project, this paper uses a case study to investigate the application of
   various innovative ICT and digital technology systems on the dynamic
   capabilities of a construction firm and across the supply chain of a
   project. The case study presented is the New Royal Adelaide Hospital
   (nRAH) in South Australia. This is a joint venture project under a
   Public Private Partnership agreement to design and construct AUS\$ 1.85b
   hospital. The case study showed that various challenging examples of
   functional complexity exists that required innovative process management
   approaches by the construction firm to withstand the test and trial of
   such a complex project, to successful completion. This has further
   contributed to the elevation of the dynamic capabilities of the
   construction firm as well as to its overall reputational assets and
   branding, nationally as well as internationally. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {This paper contributes an inclusive review of scientific studies in the
   field of sustainable human building ecosystems (SHBEs). Reducing energy
   consumption by making buildings more energy efficient has been touted as
   an easily attainable approach to promoting carbon-neutral energy
   societies. Yet, despite significant progress in research and technology
   development, for new buildings, as energy codes are getting more
   stringent, more and more technologies, e.g., LED lighting, VRF systems,
   smart plugs, occupancy-based controls, are used. Nevertheless, the
   adoption of energy efficient measures in buildings is still limited in
   the larger context of the developing countries and middle
   income/low-income population. The objective of Sustainable Human
   Building Ecosystem Research Coordination Network (SHBE-RCN) is to expand
   synergistic investigative podium in order to subdue barriers in
   engineering, architectural design, social and economic perspectives that
   hinder wider application, adoption and subsequent performance of
   sustainable building solutions by recognizing the essential role of
   human behaviors within building-scale ecosystems. Expected long-term
   outcomes of SHBE-RCN are collaborative ideas for transformative
   technologies, designs and methods of adoption for future design,
   construction and operation of sustainable buildings.},

Abstract = {Building stocks are the dominant consumers of resources within national
   economies. Correspondingly, there is high demand for improved knowledge
   of material stocks and flows in the built environment. Material flow
   analysis is well suited to meet this demand. Although numerous studies
   have been conducted on this topic over recent years, these frequently
   lack applicability and transferability due to insufficient documentation
   or treatment of uncertainties. A new approach is presented here to
   calculate material stocks and flows for domestic buildings using the
   example of multi-family housing (MFH) in Germany. The approach is
   critically examined to determine its validity. The calculation process
   involves four steps: (1) building types are classified according to
   building age; (2) highly specific material composition indicators (MCIs)
   are calculated for the respective building types; (3) the total material
   stock as well as inflows and outflows are derived from the total floor
   space of Germany's MFH; and (4) validity tests are performed to quantify
   uncertainties. The main results are age-based MCIs for MFH, the total
   material mass as well as quantitative information on parameter- and
   model-related uncertainties. Conclusions are drawn on the validity of
   results, the scalability and applicability of the model and its
   implementation, along with potential model refinements.},

Abstract = {Building heat demand is responsible for a significant share of the total
   global final energy consumption. Building stock models with a high
   spatio-temporal resolution are a powerful tool to investigate the
   effects of new building policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency,
   the introduction of new heating technologies or the integration of
   buildings within an energy system based on renewable energy sources.
   Therefore, building stock models have to be able to model the
   improvements and variation of used materials in buildings. In this
   paper, we propose a method based on generalized large-scale geographic
   information system (GIS) to model building heat demand of large regions
   with a high temporal resolution. In contrast to existing building stock
   models, our approach allows to derive the envelope of all buildings from
   digital elevation models and to model location dependent effects such as
   shadowing due to the topography and climate conditions. We integrate
   spatio-temporal climate data for temperature and solar radiation to
   model climate effects of complex terrain. The model is validated against
   a database containing the measured energy demand of 1845 buildings of
   the city of St. Gallen, Switzerland and 120 buildings of the Alpine
   village of Zernez, Switzerland. The proposed model is able to assess and
   investigate large regions by using spatial data describing natural and
   anthropogenic land features. The validation resulted in an average
   goodness of fit (R-2) of 0.6.},

Title = {BIM and Digital Tools for State-of-the-Art Construction Cost Management},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cost overrun has remained a key risk of construction projects that can
   be prevented by utilizing new technologies. This paper aims to identify
   the gap in the literature, which can potentially be addressed by using
   digital tools and technologies, by reviewing the current and state of
   the art practices. The paper presents the results of a systematic and
   critical content reviews on cost overruns, to address the question of
   what factors are affecting the cost overrun. This paper also reviews how
   building information modeling (BIM) in conjunction with other tools,
   such as the common tools in the Asia and Asia Pacific regions, are used
   for cost estimation and monitoring. The paper presents the results of
   the content review, including their contributions and limitations, which
   are also used to set key directions for future investigations. A total
   of 176 papers was identified to develop the construction cost management
   (CCM) dataset. The method was a mix of systematic reviews, including
   co-authorship network analyses, co-occurrence analytical map development
   covering 5671 keywords, and content analysis including theme
   identification and a critical review of selected papers. The paper
   critically reviewed 63 selected papers from CCM, which are divided into
   four clusters based on their scopes: BIM adoption for cost estimation
   and quantity surveying; BIM implementation for a bill of quantity, risk
   paths, and cost overruns; cost control and management; and, finally,
   BIM, virtual design, and value management. A trend analysis using a set
   of 16 themes (e.g., 3D model, BIM, Decision, Energy, and Life Cycle) for
   all the papers over the past ten years was developed. The content of
   each cluster of papers was reviewed based on the frequency of the
   selected themes in each cluster. The content of each cluster of papers
   was also reviewed critically and gaps were identified, so a set of
   directions for future investigations are presented.},

Title = {Modelling building ownership boundaries within BIM environment: A case

Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {A},
Pages = {24-38},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Australia, current practices for subdividing ownership spaces in
   buildings rely on two-dimensional (2D) analogue subdivision plans. As
   building subdivisions become more complex, these plans demonstrate
   limitations in communicating various boundaries that define complex
   ownership interests inside multi-storey buildings. With advances in
   three-dimensional (3D) digital information technologies, 3D digital
   models are increasingly being researched as a possible solution for
   improving the recording and representation of building ownership
   boundaries to overcome these communication challenges. This paper
   examines the feasibility of one such model - Building Information Models
   (BIM) - as it offers a collaborative, 3D, digital and semantically
   enriched data environment to support the integrated management of both
   physical and functional aspects of buildings over their lifecycle. Using
   a case study of current building subdivision practices in Victoria, this
   paper explores BIM's ability to model the boundaries of volumetric
   ownership spaces inside buildings. Through this process, relevant
   entities suitable for modelling building ownership boundaries are
   identified and proposed in the BIM standard. A prototype model is then
   implemented to showcase the practicality of the BIM environment for
   modelling building ownership boundaries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A Flexible Model for Benchmarking the Energy Usage of Automotive
   Lithium-Ion Battery Cell Manufacturing},
Journal = {BATTERIES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing use of electric vehicle batteries in the world has a
   significant impact on both society and the environment. Thus, there is a
   need for the availability of transparent information on resource
   allocation. Battery manufacturing process details in this regard are not
   available in academia or the public. The available energy data on
   manufacturing has a high variation. Furthermore, different process steps
   have different energy and material demands. A process model can
   benchmark the energy usage, provide detailed process data, and compare
   various cell productions which in turn can be used in life-cycle
   assessment studies to reduce the variation and provide directions for
   improvements. Therefore, a cell manufacturing model is developed for the
   calculation of energy and material demands for different battery types,
   plant capacities, and process steps. The model consists of the main
   process steps, machines, intermediate products and building service
   units. Furthermore, the results are validated using literature values.
   For a case study of a 2 GWh plant that produces prismatic NMC333 cells,
   the total energy requirement on a theoretical and optimal basis is
   suggested to be 44.6 Wh(in production)/Wh(cell capacity). This energy
   consumption in producing batteries is dominated by electrode drying, and
   dry room. Energy usage for a variety of cell types for a similar plant
   capacity shows that the standard deviation in the results is low (47.23
   +/- 13.03 Wh/Wh).},

Abstract = {Among the various civil engineering tasks, geospatial monitoring of
   engineering structures takes an essential place. In the digital era, the
   concept of geospatial monitoring needs a total re-definition. The
   widespread dissemination of BIM creates new opportunities and challenges
   simultaneously for the monitoring problem. The presented paper aims to
   develop the new concept of geospatial monitoring tailored to BIM
   features and possibilities. The interrelationship of BIM, building life
   cycle, and geospatial monitoring of engineering structures has been
   demonstrated. The critical element of geospatial monitoring is its
   workflow. Up today, BIM is considered separately from monitoring
   workflow. However, the main stages of geospatial monitoring cannot get
   by without BIM. That is why the new monitoring workflow with BIM support
   has been suggested. The workflow takes into account three main stages:
   design, data collection, and analysis. For each of these stages, the
   role and application of BIM have been examined. The question of
   geospatial monitoring design has been addressed, and the new approach to
   monitoring design with BIM involvement has been suggested. It was
   pointed out the meaning of BIM for the data collection stage and
   especially for analysis. The refined concept of geospatial monitoring
   has been considered as a case study of high-rise building monitoring.},

Abstract = {As information development has progressed in the field of architecture
   in China, owing to the lack of unified information exchange standards
   and information integration mechanisms, it is difficult to exchange and
   share information between different stages and application systems
   during the construction lifecycle. The formation of information islands
   and faults hinders the application of information technology in the
   field of construction, thus affecting the production efficiency of the
   industry. In this study, construction engineering management and
   computer building information modeling (BIM) are deeply integrated, and
   an international standard for the construction industry is introduced.
   Moreover, a BIM information integrated building management platform is
   developed that combines BIM technology with the construction engineering
   management to realize the exchange of engineering information and shared
   and integrated management, in addition to providing theories, methods,

Abstract = {Digital technologies are considered enablers of circular economy
   implementation in the built environment. Literature mainly focuses on
   conceptual or review studies examining the role of digital tools (e.g.,
   material passport and building information modelling) to close the
   material loops. There is a lack of understanding of how digital
   technologies are implemented in real-life and whether they offer value
   to the industry actors. This study conducted a multiple-case study to
   collect empirical evidence from Dutch social housing organizations
   actively applying circular principles in new construction, renovation,
   maintenance, and demolition projects. Our findings suggest that
   artificial intelligence, digital twins, and scanning technologies
   support data collection, integration, and analysis for slowing the loops
   strategies (i.e., maintenance), while digital marketplaces facilitate
   material reuse, enabling narrowing and closing the loops. This study
   identified 12 challenges that hinder the broader adoption of digital

Title = {Cloud-Based BIM Governance Platform Requirements and Specifications:
   Software Engineering Approach Using BPMN and UML},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Utilization of cloud technologies has recently attained a profile in
   building information modeling (BIM). Many studies have investigated the
   potential role of cloud in facilitating the use of BIM in the
   construction domain. In addition, recent studies have focused on the
   role of cloud in facilitating team collaboration across a building's
   lifecycle by applying a BIM governance model. The lack of a suitable
   means for the governance of collaboration and for the access and
   archival of data has been cited as the key barrier for the widespread
   adoption of collaborative BIM environments. This study, therefore,
   investigates the requirements for BIM governance and develops
   specifications for a cloud-based BIM governance platform (GovernBIM).
   The study also uses findings from wide consultation in combination with
   software engineering approaches using business process model notation
   (BPMN) and unified modeling language (UML) to define the platform's
   requirements and specifications. This platform also aims to provide a
   computerized solution for overall BIM governance solution to facilitate
   team collaboration and mange generated BIM data during a project's
   lifecycle. This ensures that data is consistent, available, and hosted
   in a scalable storage environment with high performance computing
   capabilities. The results from this study (1)define functional,
   nonfunctional, and domain-specific requirements for developing a
   GovernBIM platform; (2)develop a set of BPMN diagrams to describe the
   internal and external business procedures of the GovernBIM platform
   lifecycle for setting, configuring, managing, and using a GovernBIM
   platform; (3)evaluate several fundamental UML use cases for the adoption
   of the GovernBIM platform; (4)present a core BIM governance model (UML
   class diagram) to present the internal structure of the GovernBIM
   platform; and (5)provide a well-structured, cloud-based architecture to
   develop the GovernBIM platform for practical implementation.},

Title = {Thermal and mechanical behavior of straw-based construction: A review},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {316},
Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {Bio-based materials such as straw are becoming a promising alternative
   to improve the building energy performance and to reduce its carbon
   footprint. When compared to common building construction materials,
   biobased materials control the temperature and the relative humidity
   variation to ameliorate the indoor comfort with a low embodied energy
   and CO2 emission. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the
   thermal and mechanical properties of straw-based materials and
   buildings. The objective is to synthesis the work that has been carried
   out by the research community and to compare the results. The paper
   first introduces straw bale as a construction material from a historical
   viewpoint and in the context of the current building sector. The second
   part focuses on the available chemical and microstructural data of the
   straw fiber. The third part refers to the thermophysical and mechanical
   properties of the bales. The fourth part reviews the numerical and
   experimental studies done at the wall scale. The fifth part describes
   straw bale construction methods considering the regulation, structure
   requirements, and life cycle assessment data. Last, a critical analysis
   of the currently available data on straw as a building material is
   carried out and pending research issues are discussed. It was found
   that, despite abundant literature on structural and thermal properties
   of straw bale constructions, there is still a lack of some information.
   At a fiber scale, more research should be done to compare straw fibers
   to other natural and synthetic fibers. At a bale scale, further
   pH-related research is needed because it affects the material's interior
   conditions and durability. In addition, a thermal conductivity model for
   straw should be developed. On a bigger scale, the hygrothermal
   characteristics of various types of walls must be measured and computed
   experimentally and theoretically under various exterior and internal
   situations. More research is needed to improve the sound resistance of
   the straw wall by adding new layers capable of absorbing acoustic waves.
   Studies on the energy behavior, cost analysis, and how interior air
   moisture is self-regulated in straw buildings are needed at the building
   size. Therefore, a lack of consistent data among the different studies
   was noted depending on the straw characteristics.},

   preconstruction stages. This can be possible using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). To demonstrate the use of BIM in sustainable design, a
   villa is taken for model study. The conventional building performance is
   analysed using Autodesk Revit which included various parameters like
   energy use intensity, lifecycle energy use/cost, annual carbon
   emissions, monthly heating and cooling loads, monthly peak demand and
   monthly electricity and fuel consumption. By employing the use of green
   materials in the conventional building model, the conventional building
   model is modified into a green building model. Using BIM, the use of
   artificial resources can be greatly reduced by replacing them with the
   use of renewable energy resources thereby saving energy. To show how
   efficient BIM is, the results of the performance of the conventional and
   green building models are compared. BIM has proved to be efficient in
   achieving sustainability with earlier decision making and rectification
   of errors.},

Title = {3D point cloud data processing with machine learning for construction
   and infrastructure applications: A comprehensive review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Point clouds are increasingly being used to improve productivity,
   quality, and safety throughout the life cycle of construction and
   infrastructure projects. While applicable for visualizing construction
   projects, point clouds lack meaningful semantic information. Thus, the
   theoretical benefits of point clouds, such as productivity, quality, and
   safety improvement, in the construction and infrastructure domains can
   only be achieved after the processing of point clouds. Manual processing
   of point cloud datasets is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. A
   variety of automatic approaches, such as machine learning methods, are
   adopted in different steps of automatic processing of point clouds. This
   article surveys recent research on point cloud datasets, which were
   automatically processed with machine learning methods in construction
   and infrastructure industries. An outline for future research is
   proposed based on identified research gaps. This review paper aims to be
   a reference for researchers to acknowledge the state-of-the-art
   applications of automatically-processed point cloud models in
   construction and infrastructure domains and a guide to assist
   stakeholders in developing automatic procedures in construction and
   infrastructure industries.},

Title = {Awareness and challenges of building information modelling (BIM)
   implementation in the Yemen construction industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the awareness of construction
   practitioners of the adoption of building information modeling (BIM) and
   identification of the dominant challenges of implementing BIM in the
   life cycle of a construction project. Design/methodology/approach This
   study was sequentially conducted in the following in three main phases:
   a preliminary study of archival literature, where a rigorous study of
   the literature was conducted to identify the challenges of adopting BIM
   in the construction industry which was to be applied later to the
   challenges in the case of the Yemen construction industry; data
   collection, where data were collected using a questionnaire survey
   targeting 123 Yemeni construction practitioners working in managerial
   and technical levels; and data analysis, where data were analyzed using
   descriptive analysis by calculating the average index and standard
   deviations. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software. Findings The
   results show that the most critical challenges to adopt BIM are
   financial restrictions, lack of BIM knowledge, improper introduction of
   BIM concepts, lack of awareness of BIM benefits and no governmental
   enforcement. The study recommends policymakers and construction players
   to consider the challenges for a better introduction of BIM in the Yemen
   construction industry. Research limitations/implications - This research
   focuses on the awareness and challenges of implementing BIM in the Yemen
   construction industry. Practical implications - The findings of this
   study will help policymakers develop more constructive strategies to
   reduce the challenges and introduce governmental agendas towards the
   widespread use of the BIM concept and technology in the Yemen
   construction industry. The study suggested an in-depth investigation
   into the current curriculum in the Yemen universities and recommended
   the introduction of BIM concept in engineering courses. Social
   implications This study focused on the challenges of implementing BIM
   and the role of the social aspect in the issue. Originality/value From
   the extensive review of previous findings, this paper concentrates on
   the challenged to the implementation of BIM in the Yemen construction
   industry. There are lack of investigative studies that focus on the
   introduction of new technologies to advance the Yemen construction
   sector. Therefore, the findings help the authority to diagnose and
   address the sources of these challenges and introduce new solutions to
   the industry.},

Title = {Automatic creation of semantically rich 3D building models from laser
   scanner data},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {325-337},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain,
   semantically rich 3D information models are increasingly used throughout
   a facility's life cycle for diverse applications, such as planning
   renovations, space usage planning, and managing building maintenance.
   These models, which are known as building information models (BIMs), are
   often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point measurements
   obtained from laser scanners. Laser scanners can rapidly capture the
   ``as-is{''} conditions of a facility, which may differ significantly
   from the design drawings. Currently, the conversion from laser scan data
   to BIM is primarily a manual operation, and it is labor-intensive and
   can be error-prone. This paper presents a method to automatically
   convert the raw 3D point data from a laser scanner positioned at
   multiple locations throughout a facility into a compact, semantically
   rich information model. Our algorithm is capable of identifying and
   modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment
   (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doorways) despite the presence of
   significant clutter and occlusion, which occur frequently in natural
   indoor environments. Our method begins by extracting planar patches from
   a voxelized version of the input point cloud. The algorithm learns the
   unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual
   relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically
   label patches as walls, ceilings, or floors. Then, we perform a detailed
   analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings, such as windows
   and doorways. This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse
   measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded
   regions and holes in the surface. Next, we use a learning algorithm to
   intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even
   when partially occluded. Finally, occluded surface regions are filled in
   using a 3D inpainting algorithm. We evaluated the method on a large,
   highly cluttered data set of a building with forty separate rooms. (C)

Abstract = {The success of smartphone technologies changed the way information is
   processed as more and more geo-referenced structures are emerging
   linking information to specific locations within our environment.
   Thereby, Augmented Reality has become a key technology as it analyses
   the smartphone sensor data (camera, GPS, inertial) to derive the
   detailed pose of the smartphone, with the aim to correlate our real
   environment to the geo-referenced information space. In particular, this
   is relevant for application fields where 3D-models are used in planning
   and organization processes as e. g. facility management. In facility
   construction and management Building Information Model (BIM) was
   established as a standard that not only holds the 3D-building-geometry
   but encompasses pipe/electrical systems as well as semantic building
   information, for example properties and conditions of building

   databases. All these aspects are subject of the InData activities, and
   are decisive for a harmonization of LCA for sustainable building. With
   this concept of digitalization the propagation of the use of
   environmental product declarations (EPD) in building LCA was enhanced,
   and also new applications for using EPD data are offered, e.g. in BIM or
   other context.},

Title = {An ontology change management approach for facility management},

Abstract = {Facility management (FM) or technical property management is an approach
   to operate, maintain, improve and adapt buildings and infrastructures of
   organizations. A FM project requires the cooperation of many actors from
   different domains so it has to be automated in a constrained
   collaborative environment. This paper proposes a new approach for
   ontology change management applied on facility management of such
   projects. The industrial challenge is, firstly, to ensure consistency of
   a FM project knowledge from the construction phase to the technical
   property management phase (after delivery). Secondly, it has to provide
   to each actor of the project a personal up-to-date ``view{''} of the
   building knowledge related to its business profile and allow its
   evolution. The scientific approach, called OntoVersionGraph, is a change
   management methodology for managing ontology life cycle including
   ontology evolution and versioning features, in conjunction with
   contextual view modeling. Its contribution is the impact management of
   changes between the ontology and its different views. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {A conceptual tool for environmentally benign design: development and

Abstract = {Design is a decision-making process for which knowledge is a
   prerequisite. Most decisions are taken at the conceptual stage and have
   pronounced influence on the final design. The literature, therefore,
   recommends the incorporation of sustainability criteria, such as
   environment, at this stage. Difficulty in performing life cycle
   assessment (LCA) due to low availability of information at the
   conceptual stage for evaluation and highly abstract nature of solutions,
   inadequate incorporation of DfE (Design for Environment) guidelines and
   LCA reports into the design process, and a lack of effective
   communication of the same to the designers for prompt decision-making
   are major motivations for the development of a support. This paper
   discusses a ``conceptual Tool for environmentally benign design{''} -
   concepTe - that supports designers in decision-making during the
   conceptual design stage, by offering environmental impact (EI) estimates
   of abstract solutions with associated uncertainty, for evaluation and
   selection of the most environmentally benign solution as concept. The EI
   estimates are calculated by a module in the tool based on a proposed EI
   estimation method, which requires the support of a knowledge base to
   fetch appropriate LCA information corresponding to the design element
   being conceptualized. This knowledge base is grounded in the
   domain-agnostic SAPPhIRE model ontology, allows semantic operability of
   the knowledge, and offers the results to the designers in a familiar
   domain language to aid decision-making. A ``proof of concept{''} of the
   tool is developed for application in design of building in the AEC
   (Architectural design, Engineering, and Construction) domain. Further,
   empirical studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   ``proof of concept{''} to support decision-making and results are found
   favorable. The paper also discusses the future scope for further
   development of the tool into a holistic design decision-making platform.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Successful concepts are adopted throughout the phases of the building
   lifecycle to provide maximum comfort and benefits to occupiers without
   compromising the function of such a project. Although there is limited
   information on building information modeling (BIM) execution in
   developing countries, BIM drivers have received significant attention
   from different researchers, but with a limited investigation into the
   influence of BIM barriers on such building projects. Our goal with this
   research is to identify and remove any challenges that may stand in the
   way of using BIM in developing country construction projects. To this
   end, a comprehensive literature search uncovered impediments to BIM
   implementation. To assess the relative importance of the numerous
   challenges to BIM mentioned in the literature, a survey questionnaire
   was distributed to a sample of specialists in the construction industry.
   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to classify these challenges,
   and partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was
   created to bring attention to the most pressing ones in the context of
   BIM adoption. The results of this research will inform policymakers in
   underdeveloped nations interested in adopting BIM on the pitfalls they
   should avoid.},

Title = {Multidisciplinary design optimization in Architecture, Engineering, and

Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {The design of buildings has become a complex and multidisciplinary
   problem involving multiple conflicting objectives as architects and
   designers address competing technical, economic, environmental, and
   societal concerns. This has been driving research in Architecture,
   Engineering, and Construction (AEC) toward rigorous multidisciplinary
   decision-making frameworks that generate and evaluate numerous design
   alternatives using multi-objective optimization in concert with
   simulation and analysis models of varying fidelity and computational
   expense. While such frameworks are well known and widely employed in the
   aerospace and systems engineering domains, efforts by design
   professionals and researchers in the AEC field are scattered at best. In
   this paper, we provide a detailed review of recent developments in
   optimization frameworks in the AEC field and subsequently highlight how
   such developments are largely compartmentalized into separate domains
   such as structural, energy, daylighting, and other performance factors.
   We further discuss the technical challenges involved in concurrent
   coupled multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the AEC field
   such as interoperability issues between Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) environments, analysis/simulation tools, and optimization
   frameworks. We conclude by outlining research needed for more unified
   modeling and simulation-based optimization frameworks to aid in complex
   and multidisciplinary building design processes. We also highlight the
   need for the identification and development of multi-fidelity simulation
   tools for use across multiple design phases. As such, this paper
   contributes a novel roadmap to leverage aerospace and systems
   engineering research in MDO into the field of AEC, along with a call for
   researchers in the MDO community to seek collaborations in AEC field.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces an emulator developed to assess the operational
   characteristics of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) for the second World
   Championship in Cybernetic Building Optimization (WCCBO). The emulator
   utilizes BACnet communication and provides a realistic simulation for
   evaluating energy conservation and comfort in buildings with VRF
   systems. Herein, we discuss the building specifications for calculation,
   operation of the emulator, calculation method for the vertical
   temperature distribution, dissatisfactory rate calculation, and
   consideration of championship rules. Notably, a thermal preference model
   was developed for predicting the thermal sensation of occupants and
   adjusting the dissatisfaction rate based on their ability to control the
   indoor environment. In addition, we developed a method for calculating
   the total scores during the WCCBO and devised a suitable network
   structure for score registration. The results of this study highlight
   the importance of personal control and impact of drafts on thermal
   comfort. This paper presents a meta-level methodology to determine the
   best operation for each specific VRF system for a future world
   championship, whose planning is underway and will be conducted to
   accumulate information on optimal operations.},

Title = {Development of Alignment-Based Parametric Data Exchange Schema for
   Bridge Geometry},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2014},
Number = {2460},
Pages = {22-30},
Abstract = {The benefits of using building information modeling to integrate the
   project delivery process by exchange of project data between industry
   stakeholders stimulate the bridge industry to develop bridge information
   modeling. However, the existing data exchange methods, formats, and
   standards that are used by the building industry cannot be directly
   borrowed and used ``as is{''} for bridge projects. Bridge projects
   involve specific definitions of structural geometry (e.g., roadway
   alignment driven bridge layout) or definitions of bridge member geometry
   that are not usually used in building projects (e.g., camber data for
   steel plate girders). These bridge-oriented geometries cannot be
   described by using current building-oriented data exchange formats.
   Because bridge geometry depends on the geometry of the roadway carried
   by the bridge, it is beneficial to define a bridge as a parametric model
   that can be manipulated by modifying a manageably small number of
   independent parameters (e.g., station and skew). However, the existing
   data exchange standards do not support the exchange of parametric
   geometry. To overcome these technical limitations, this paper presents a
   software-neutral schema for the exchange of alignment-driven
   bridge-oriented parametric geometry data using eXtensible Markup
   Language. The application of this formalism is then illustrated via
   three high-priority use cases that occur during the steel bridge life
   cycle.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on a lifecycle evaluation of building sustainability
   following a Green Building standard - LEED. The purpose is to provide an
   efficient and effective way to guide the different stakeholders involved
   in the building lifecycle performance properly and realize sustainable
   practices, which includes the owner, designer, contractor, manager, and
   end-users. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is selected to be a
   platform to integrate all the information to improve interoperability.
   Starting from planning and design phase, LEED standards will be embedded
   in the BIM model to evaluate the building design. A rule-based system is
   developed to automatically evaluate the sustainability and provide
   flexibility for different scenarios to gain better green grade. This BIM
   model will be also used during the construction phase and data collected
   from the construction site will be integrated and the model will be
   updated in real-time using an RTLS system. The as-built situation will
   be checked to see if it matches the as-designed sustainability aspects.
   During the operation phase, energy consumption data are collected and
   energy consumption patterns are analyzed based on the spatial division
   in the building. The real energy performance of the building can be
   checked to see if the designed features reach the sustainability goal.},

Abstract = {Federal buildings should be exemplary in every way. With this aim in
   view, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community (BMI)
   with the responsibility for federal construction and their
   administration, is pushing for digitization in construction for the
   federal government as the largest client in the field of building
   construction. For this reason, the BMI has drawn up a master plan
   entitled ``BIM for Federal Buildings{''} in cooperation with the Federal
   Ministry of Defence (BMVg), which is responsible for supply and
   operation of federal military buildings, and with the participation of
   the Institute for Federal Real Estate (BImA) in order to improve the
   efficiency and speed of federal construction in the future with digital
   design, construction and operation. Above all, the master plan is
   conceptualized to take on a driving role for considering the overall
   life cycle of buildings. The master plan describes the implementation of
   BIM for all future federal construction projects. The core of the
   strategic document is a target vision that sets an obligatory time
   horizon for the implementation of BIM. The master plan was developed
   using a participatory research style by the Institute of Construction
   Management and Digital Engineering, Leibniz Universitat Hannover, as
   assigned by the BMI in collaboration with BMVg and BImA.},

Abstract = {Achieving the UN sustainable development goals, construction industry
   shows a great potential. Since 50\% of the total resource consumption
   and 40\% of the entire energy demand in the European Union are caused by
   the construction sector, procurement processes indicate a crucial
   starting point improving sustainable construction. Currently,
   organizations struggle with implementing sustainable procurement
   processes. Missing information on sustainability issues can be stated as
   an important problem in the sourcing procedure. Consequently,
   interactions of planning processes and sustainable procurement represent
   a fundamental topic. To investigate the current situation on procurement
   especially in Austria, an expert survey has been carried out. Therefore,
   a set of three central research questions has been elaborated that could
   be evaluated by a detailed survey. Based on the detection of relevant
   stakeholders, by means of a standardized online-questionnaire the
   implementation of life cycle-oriented sustainability issues has been
   surveyed. The contribution is going to illustrate the current situation
   of lifecycle-oriented planning, awarding and tendering of construction
   works in Austria. Furthermore, deductions were made based on the results
   of the survey, indicating action areas and presenting future potential
   of the application of building information modelling.},

Abstract = {The challenge is to decide how to design a building information model
   (BIM) to support building maintenance and development for existing
   buildings. Until now the main BIM focus has been related to new
   projects, and this study focus on different challenges when deciding to
   use BIM for both new and existing buildings. This paper is based on
   studies together with regional and hospital authorities, but should be
   relevant for other types of existing buildings as well.
   The primary objectives of these studies are to implement requirements
   for fire safety, universal design, environmental regulations, status of
   maintenances, occupancy, daily operations, rebuilding, mechanical,
   electrical, and plumbing installations (MEP) and effective use of energy
   and space within the BIM model. Additionally, these studies consider
   what BIM competence is required and by whom. It must also be decided
   which information is necessary for operating different types of
   building, and which information must be kept up to date. Successful BIM
   adoption needs a good implementation strategy, professional guidelines
   and motivated people in the organisation.
   This paper explains important options and decisions necessary to
   establish a BIM for management of existing buildings. Central questions
   concern the need for competence at different levels in the building
   owner organisations. At the same time the paper considers how the
   organisational structures may need to be adjusted.},

   Combining case-based reasoning and natural language processing},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most knowledge management (KM) techniques capture knowledge at the end
   of a project, leading to knowledge loss. Building information modeling
   (BIM) is a building information management process throughout the
   project lifecycle. This study uses BIM for lifecycle knowledge capture
   to address knowledge loss. Knowledge in construction projects is
   intricate, intensifying the challenges of knowledge retrieval. This
   study combines natural language processing (NLP) and case-based
   reasoning (CBR) to improve knowledge retrieval, which not only takes
   advantage of CBR for retrieving knowledge case context through
   attributes but also obtains the benefits of NLP for retrieving text
   descriptions of knowledge cases. The parameters created in BIM
   correspond to the CBR attributes and NLP case descriptions. Quantitative
   test and case study confirm that the novel approach proposed in this
   study can improve knowledge retrieval performance and prevent knowledge
   loss. It also provides new insights into the transformation from BIM to
   building knowledge modeling (BKM).},

Abstract = {The active and fruitful participation of users in the development
   projects of information systems (IS) is a crucial factor in achieving
   success. However, difficulties such as conflict and apathy often plague
   IS development projects that do not rely on building effective
   partnerships between users and those responsible for the development.
   Partnering ideas have been proposed that consider the building of
   relationships earlier in the life cycle of the development project. With
   this in mind, we propose going back further to the screening process and
   build a model that establishes how directed screening of projects to
   consider user-related criteria can improve the active participation of
   users by fostering trust, knowledge exchange, and a collective mind in
   the project team among users and developers. The model is tested with a
   sample of IS project managers and finds that project performance can be
   enhanced by attending to screening criteria that consider the user
   perspective when selecting projects to add to the organizational
   portfolio. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The management of information throughout a building's lifecycle is
   becoming increasingly important, and building information modeling (BIM)
   is often used to ensure the interoperability of data. However, BIM-based
   facility information from the construction phase is difficult to access
   and use during the operation and maintenance phase. This occurs because
   the BIM information is not utilized well in facility management (FM). In
   this research, we propose an approach to effectively manage BIM-based FM
   information by linking the BIM-based building elements and FM work
   information in an FM system database. We present a Semantic Web-based FM
   information system that semantically links BIM data to relevant
   historical work records. The proposed ontology was evaluated using a
   sample dataset of the architectural maintenance work records of an
   office building. Using the proposed approach, facility managers will be
   able to increase their efficiency in searching related work records that
   consider shared BIM objects by enhancing the interoperability and
   accessibility of FM data via the Semantic Web.},

Abstract = {The conversion from building information modeling (BIM) to building
   energy modeling (BEM) based on the industry foundation classes (IFC)
   data standard is a crucial step for efficient building energy design and
   energy performance analysis. The scope encompasses analyzing limitations
   in existing BIM-to-BEM workflows and proposing an optimized strategy
   that addresses data loss and modeling inconsistencies. The research
   question revolves around enhancing conversion efficiency and precision,
   with the hypothesis validated through literature review, development of
   a conversion tool, and case study verification. The data collection and
   evaluation methods involve streamlining the conversion process by
   incorporating BIM model optimization, automatic repair of damaged
   geometric information, and automatic thermal zone division. The main
   findings reveal that the optimized strategy and tool significantly
   reduce information duplication, improve the precision of energy
   simulations, and validate the hypothesis, thereby contributing to more
   efficient and accurate building energy design and analysis.},

Title = {Sustainable building material selection: A QFD- and ELECTRE III-embedded
   hybrid MCGDM approach with consensus building},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {783-807},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Industrialization and urbanization have led to the rapid development of
   the building industry. To alleviate the adverse impact on the
   environment, natural resources, health and comfort of inhabitants,
   sustainable principles have been incorporated into the design,
   construction, decoration, operation, and maintenance of buildings. Among
   all these endeavors, sustainable building material selection is
   diffusely regarded as the simplest and most essential way of achieving
   sustainability. To this end, this paper develops a novel hybrid
   multi-criteria group decision making model for sustainable building
   material selection under uncertainty. The information representation
   construction used for alternative-criteria assessments in this model is
   a brand-new notion called Basic Uncertain Linguistic Information, which
   is capable of handling the qualitative performance estimates as well as
   its partial reliability. Multiple stakeholders are usually responsible
   for sustainable building material selection, and therefore, the fact
   that multiple perspectives are involved in the collective
   decision-making efforts is revealed by a Consensus Reaching Process to
   reach a decision reflecting at least a majority-based agreement among
   them. The Quality Function Deployment-based approach to determining
   comprehensive importance ratings of assessment criteria is further
   proposed to take into account diversifying sustainable building material
   requirements from different stakeholders. Subsequently, the ELECTRE HI
   methodology, which models the heterogeneity and non-compensation among
   assessment criteria as well as their qualitative essence, is introduced
   to determine the ultimate priorities of alternative sustainable building
   materials. Finally, sensitive and comparative analyses are performed to
   verify the advantages of the proposed model in comparison with several
   existing methodologies.},

Abstract = {Modeling is an important and time consuming part of the Business Process
   Management life-cycle. An analyst reviews existing documentation and
   queries relevant domain experts to construct both mental and concrete
   models of the domain. To aid this exercise, we propose the Rapid
   Business Process Discovery (R-BPD) framework and prototype tool that can
   query heterogeneous information resources (e.g. corporate documentation,
   web-content, code e.t.c.) and rapidly construct proto-models to be
   incrementally adjusted to correctness by an analyst. This constitutes a
   departure from building and constructing models toward just editing
   them. We believe this rapid mixed-initiative modeling will increase
   analyst productivity by significant orders of magnitude over traditional
   approaches. Furthermore, the possibility of using the approach in
   distributed and real-time settings seems appealing and may help in
   significantly improving the quality of the models being developed w.r.t.

Abstract = {Rapid development of technologies like building information modeling
   (BIM) and internet of things (IoT) has provided new tools and methods to
   facility owners for more effective asset management during the operation
   and maintenance (O\&M) phase. However, many owners face a challenge to
   identify and address needed technical and organizational transformations
   to fully leverage new technologies. This paper reports on a series of
   workshops facilitated by the authors to discover key elements in
   developing standards and processes for data-driven asset management
   systems (AMS). For this applied research, the authors worked with six
   large public owners (including army, educational, transit, and
   seaport/airport facility owners) to analyze effectiveness of their
   current AMS, taxonomy and structure of their AMS database including
   asset's types, attributes, and specifications, as well as their means
   and methods for collaboration with designers and contractors to create
   reliable data required for O\&M activities. The outcomes of this
   research are a standard framework for identifying and addressing data
   requirements for effective assets life-cycle management, as well as
   lessons learned from peer organizations' experiences and practices for
   integrating new technologies into asset management. The findings of this
   research will also help researchers in the academia to better understand
   the real-world constraints and requirements the AECO industry encounters

   resilience and reliability},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Amongst the numerous challenges faced by the Architecture, Engineering,
   Construction and Operation (AECO) sector, there is the need to fulfil
   the requirements from a wide range of increasingly demanding
   stakeholders, which are usually seeking for some sort of demonstration
   of the degree to which their needs are fulfilled (e.g. certification of
   building performance), together with an effective protection against the
   risk of nonconformities or defective buildings (e.g. financial
   warranties or insurance covering the risks of various kinds of building
   failures). Performance-based regulations and standards that are
   progressively being adopted by the AECO sector in general and the
   building subsector in particular are including the risk information,
   following what other sectors and industries have done since the 1970s.
   The needs and expectations of the AECO sector stakeholders are more
   sophisticated and include future-proofing methodologies and provisions
   that anticipate the future events, the changes, the needs or the uses to
   prepare adequately, minimizing impacts and capitalizing on opportunities
   leading to business continuity throughout the whole building projects
   life cycle. Within the realms of building design and construction
   quality control (e.g. the Consortium of European Building Control) and
   of building political-regulatory environments (e.g. the
   Inter-jurisdictional Regulatory Collaboration Committee), it has been
   argued that there is a need to balance the relative importance of
   different performance requirements and prioritize actions in face of
   limited resources for planning and controlling the building structures
   resilience and reliability. The present paper covers physical,

Abstract = {The growing worldwide population has an increasing energy use absorption
   and natural materials resources exhaustion. At the same time the growing
   society demands more and more buildings, but the changing composition in
   time cause altering desires. This change is often denied during design
   and construction phase, resulting in large streams of waste. Use of
   lightweight and recycling materials (as cardboard) in construction, can
   improve both building environment effects and flexibility.
   Understanding change by looking at the various life spans of building
   (elements) will give insight and possibilities to reduce environmental
   impact. In this paper a Service Life Planning model will be discussed,
   focussing on the scenario of balanced energy use. The recycling aspects,
   technical performance range of various types of cardboard present at the
   industry together with the low-costs aspects show potential for building
   (elements) for short life cycle use. A hypothesis is stated wherein
   temporary buildings out of cardboard to give answer to ecological
   desires and altering technical demands changing in time.
   This paper will explore the technical and economical potential of
   cardboard, focussing on the various levels of barriers and possibilities
   in the cardboard industry, which hamper the introduction of cardboard in
   building industry. Accordingly, research topics that could improve
   efficiency of cardboard as sustainable building material will be
   accentuated.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a digital representation of the
   physical and functional characteristics of a facility and is used to
   manage an entire construction process (design, construction and
   management across the entire lifecycle). BIM can be regarded as both a
   digital representation of a building and a store of data with which to
   facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information throughout
   the lifecycle of a structure.
   Buildings sustain economic losses during their lifecycle due to ordinary
   maintenance operations and unpredictable events. These events reduce the
   structural performance of a building and highlight the need for
   financial investment. The costs of maintenance operations are usually
   accurately defined, but other expenditure is not as easy to evaluate
   when events are uncertain. A lifecycle cost (LCC) analysis of buildings
   exposed to seismic risk is a critical issue in structural engineering.
   Expected losses, including initial and post-earthquake repair costs, are
   an important parameter in structural design. Herein, a simplified method
   based on a semi-probabilistic approach is implemented in a BIM model to
   evaluate the economic performance, and economic losses, of a building
   exposed to seismic risk. A BIM procedure is implemented in a case study
   to improve the feasibility of this process and to deal with the large
   amount of data concerning the damage to and cost analysis of the
   components that constitute the facility. Furthermore, this specific BIM
   tool for the economic loss assessment has been embraced in a wider
   methodology aimed at optimizing the seismic retrofit strategy, taking
   into account both safety and economic features.},

Title = {A dynamic approach for investigating design approaches to reducing
   construction waste in healthcare projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Construction waste is a global problem that makes it hard for industry
   to reach its goals for sustainability. Over recent years, the Egyptian
   government has been investing millions of pounds in new and refurbished
   healthcare building projects. Various sustainability concerns have
   emerged throughout these advancements, including the generation of
   construction waste. This study investigates the effects of two
   techniques (design for deconstruction and prefabrication and
   modularization) as construction approaches to reduce construction waste
   in the design phase based on building information modeling (BIM)
   concepts for healthcare projects. Due to the complex and dynamic nature
   of construction projects, along with their interdependencies, system
   dynamic modeling (SDM) would be a suitable method to simulate the
   dynamic nature of such projects. The model incorporates every relevant
   factor that has an impact on the system when simulating the long-term
   effects of reducing construction waste in the construction life cycle of
   projects during the design phase for two techniques in six main aspects:
   time waste, cost waste, material waste, design changes, coordination
   among project stakeholders, and Energy efficiency and sustainability
   impacts. The system dynamics model was generated by processing this
   model using Any Logic software and a stock-flow diagram. Finally, a case
   study for the proposed model is used to illustrate the validation and
   implementation. The analysis revealed that Prefabrication and
   modularization have a crucial influence on managing the construction
   waste in the design phase. Utilizing the system dynamics model in this
   study enhances construction practices and facilitates informed
   decision-making within the field.},

Abstract = {The paper describes a model-based approach to automated functional
   testing at the component level and presents results from preliminary
   field testing of a prototype software tool that implements the method.
   The method is based on an integrated life-cycle approach to HVAC
   commissioning and performance monitoring. The tool uses component-level
   HVAC equipment models implemented in an equation-based simulation
   environment. When used for commissioning, each model is configured using
   design information and component manufacturers' data. Once an acceptable
   functional test has been performed, the model is fine-tuned to match the
   actual performance of the equipment by using data measured during the
   functional test. The fine-tuned model is then used in routine operation
   for on-line monitoring and fault detection. The paper describes the
   method and reports test results from HVAC secondary systems in a
   commercial building and an experimental facility.},

Abstract = {There has been significant research on the intersection of 3D cadastre
   and building information modelling (BIM) over the recent years. BIM
   provides a multidimensional environment for capturing, curating and
   communicating the physical and functional aspects during a building's
   lifecycle. A BIM-based solution for 3D cadastre provides a rich
   repository of legal and physical datasets in a common environment. The
   knowledge encapsulated inside a cadastral BIM model should be tapped to
   unlock the value of 3D cadastral information. Therefore, this article
   aims to develop BIM-based queries for interrogating questions about the
   legal ownership of properties inside multistorey buildings. These
   queries include identifying legal spaces that belong to a private or
   common property; querying physical elements that bound a legal space;
   and finding legal spaces that are adjacent to each other at a specific
   building element.},

Title = {A SEMANTIC COMMON MODEL FOR PRODUCT DATA IN THE WATER INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {566-590},
Abstract = {The issue of interoperability in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry represents a challenge on a scale that spans
   across the project life cycle. This is predominant in the infrastructure
   sector that usually comprises a more versatile Operations and
   Maintenance (O\&M) phase in comparison with the buildings sector. To
   this end, an important stage in the information life cycle is the asset
   information capture and validation during product procurement at the
   O\&M phase. The water industry in the United Kingdom relies on Product
   Data Templates (PDTs) to fulfil such task, which is usually an error
   prone manual process. This paper presents an ongoing research, which
   investigates the application of Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) for
   improving product data exchange during product procurement at the O\&M
   phase for the water industry in the United Kingdom (UK). Therefore,
   focus group sessions with industry experts were held to discuss current
   inefficiencies and solution requirements. Based on these results, a
   semantic common model named Asset Specification Ontology (ASO) was
   developed to capture and validate asset information during product
   procurement at the O\&M phase. The common model (ontology) is based on
   available technologies, namely Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Shapes
   Constraint Language (SHACL). This gives the advantage of semantically
   rich data which can be linked and queried in a meaningful way to
   facilitate the exchange and validation of water industry assets' data.
   The uniqueness of this paper is manifested in the issue it tackles, as
   efficient product procurement, and hence, data exchange in the water
   industry is an industrial challenge that is seldom researched.
   Results from the focus group sessions showed that information exchange
   within the UK water industry is impeded due to the lack of structured
   and semantic data. However, for a robust semantic interoperability,
   there needs to be a robust semantic data infrastructure, which would
   require semantic mappings from standards to product properties, from
   standards to other standards, and from standards to dictionaries. These
   conclusions were further supported by the common model, which was
   created from existing schemas, standards, and dictionaries. Generally,
   this paper recommends a common model/product library for phase-specific
   product data exchange in the water industry.},

   examples of how impacts of behavioral and technical changes in the
   building stock can be assessed and visualized by using the approach. The
   results obtained provide meaningful and detailed information about the
   energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions of the residential
   stock. The information can be, for instance, used in various hot spot
   analyses. Additionally, the impacts Of energy efficiency measures and
   behavioral changes can be assessed. These types of analysis can be
   useful for policy makers in order to prioritize actions cost
   efficiently, such as carrying out renovations in the residential sector.

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the latest software technology
   used widely by many construction businesses - big and small -
   particularly within the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC)
   sector. Besides being a design and documentation tool, building
   information models (BIM) provide a platform for enhanced knowledge base
   collaboration, the potential to manage modification, and therefore the
   capability to provide information support throughout the lifecycle of an
   apartment building. A big share of the eastern European construction
   industries remains excluded from BIM technology and the potential
   advantages it will hand over to their business, particularly for
   renovation projects. It requies the involvement of all stakeholders to
   realize higher-level coordination, productivity, visualization and value
   efficiencies. The advantages of BIM exploitation for renovation projects
   are considered in the article. Tendencies in the development of BIM
   technologies throughout the globe and in eastern European countries on
   example of Ukraine are shown. Examples of the exploitation of local
   building information systems in realizing renovation processes are
   given, and proposals for policymakers in terms of applying BIM
   technologies in housing renovation activities and facility management
   are formulated.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As the global climate continues to change, lowering carbon emissions of
   public buildings (CEPB) is essential for reducing carbon emissions from
   the construction sector. Exploring the current status of the field is
   crucial to improving the effort to reduce CEPB. CiteSpace and VOSviewer
   are used in this research to visualize the literature on CEPB from the
   Web of Science Core Collection from 2002 to 2022, including an overview,
   collaborations, and keywords, as well as references. The paper then
   analyzes and reviews the research processes of CEPB in conjunction with
   the visualization results and the collation of information from the
   literature. The results show that the current research hotspots include
   (1) theoretical research and simulation modeling, (2) energy systems,
   (3) materials, (4) public building retrofitting, (5) the main factors
   that contribute to the reduction in CEPB. Architectural features and
   structures and digital technology are the frontiers of research in the
   field of CEPB. In general, there is still sufficient space to develop in
   the field. These findings intuitively encapsulate the valuable
   information and inherent value of a significant body of literature,
   which can help researchers quickly understand the field and provide some
   references.},

Abstract = {This study estimates the amount of urban ores in Taipei City between
   1965 and 2014 by analyzing data of the buildings through statistics and
   geographical information systems (GIS). Hot spot analysis (HSA) is
   introduced to assess the location of resources. Our results show that up
   to the year 2014, 186 Mton of construction materials were accumulated in
   Taipei, and the per capita total building material stock was 68 ton. In
   the short term, the hot spots with development potential are Da'an (Zone
   I) and Zhongshan (Zone II) Districts in Taipei City. Zone I (0.1 km(2))
   stored 180 kton of materials; while Zone II (0.6 km(2)) stored 119 kton
   of materials. This study provides quantitative data on urban ores with
   high spatial and temporal resolution for enhancing material recycling
   planning and management. Material stocks could then combine with the
   material flow to build a dynamic material flow model for assessing the
   quantity of extractable urban ores, and the feasibility of exploitation
   in the future.},

   model are established by the research of cloud calculation information.
   In order to express these models accurately, the parametric concept is
   proposed. Therefore, by combining with the corresponding building
   information, the cloud calculation information park is realized in the
   whole lifecycle. The maximize return is obtained by the suitable

   US NAE Gordon Prize engineering curriculum innovation, The Learning
   Factory - as a possible roadmap to reform and complement existing
   Bachelors of Science (BS) degrees in engineering. By providing a series

Volume = {23},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Each year businesses, governments, and homeowners in the United States
   invest around one fifth of gross domestic product into the creation of
   capital assets such as buildings, machinery, and software to enable
   production and consumption. Use of capital is typically included to some
   extent in environmental life cycle assessments of goods and services but
   is not incorporated into most environmentally extended input-output
   (EEIO) models, including the US Environmental Protection Agency's
   USEEIO. Capital assets are typically created in years prior to their
   use, so a challenge lies in distributing the impacts of their creation
   over time. In this work, a highly detailed capital flow matrix approach
   is followed to distribute the use of fixed capital assets to consuming
   industries. Data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis's Fixed Asset
   Accounts is merged with its Industry Accounts data by the creation of
   concordance tables. Public highways and streets are partially
   reallocated to industries operating vehicles. The resulting capital use
   matrix is later combined into a modified USEEIO. ``Housing{''} is found
   to be the largest consumer of fixed assets, followed by general
   government, fossil fuel extraction, and financial industries involved in
   leasing. Construction, vehicles, and machinery are mostly used by
   industries in the form of fixed assets. The types of fixed assets used
   by industries are consistent with expectations: housing is dominated by
   structures, transport by equipment, and information industries by
   intellectual property products.},

Title = {Conservation data parameters for BIM-enabled heritage asset management},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Key BIM concepts such as parametric modelling, database formulation and
   structured information management could offer huge benefits and
   efficiencies to the built historic environment in the operation and
   maintenance phase (O\&M) of a building's lifecycle (lifecycle BIM), such
   as heritage asset management, and particularly conservation repair and
   maintenance (CRM) programming. Despite these potential benefits,
   practical examples of the use of BIM for O\&M in a heritage context are
   limited in the published literature. This paper considers known barriers
   to the general implementation of lifecycle BIM, in particular the
   identification of critical information requirements, and introduces an
   Antarctic case study that sought to establish a framework of data
   parameters, limited specifically to BIM-enabled heritage asset
   management. Research findings suggest that while developing a framework
   of conservation data parameters is a relatively simple task, it is the
   retrospective compilation of historic building information for the
   development of a structured Asset Information Model (AIM) that presents
   more of a challenge. Furthermore, it is highlighted that adoption of the
   information management process is critically affected by socio-technical
   dimensions, and that working practices within the heritage sector need
   to be carefully aligned to a BIM philosophy for successful
   implementation. The key challenges and findings of this research should
   be considered when developing guidance for the implementation of
   BIM-enabled heritage asset management.},

Title = {Quality of crowdsourced geospatial building information: A global
   assessment of OpenStreetMap attributes},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {237},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Geospatial data of the building stock is essential in many domains
   pertaining to the built environment. These datasets are often provided
   by governments, but crowdsourcing them has surged in the last decade.
   Nowadays, OpenStreetMap (OSM) - the most popular Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) platform - contains geospatial and descriptive data on
   more than 500 million buildings worldwide collected by millions of
   contributors, and it is increasingly used in studies ranging from energy
   and microclimate to urban planning and life cycle assessment. However,
   large-scale understanding on their quality remains limited, which may
   hinder their use and management. In this paper, we seek to understand
   the state of building information in OSM and whether it is a reliable
   source of such data. We provide a comprehensive study to assess the
   quality of attribute (descriptive) data of the building stock mapped
   globally, e.g. building function, which are key ingredients in many
   analyses and simulations in the built environment. We examine three
   aspects: completeness, consistency, and accuracy. In this assessment,
   the first at such scale and the most comprehensive available hitherto,
   we find that quality continues to be highly heterogeneous - from poor
   quality in some, to very high completeness in other areas, potentially
   benefiting a range of application domains, e.g. we estimate that 3D
   building models of 443 administrative units (mostly cities and
   municipalities) around the world can be generated from OSM, underpinning
   the generation of digital twins. The number of floors and building type
   are the most frequent properties that contributors record, and in most
   cases are highly accurate, while mapping the interior of buildings did
   not gain momentum.},

Title = {Conceptual Framework of Information Flow Synchronization Throughout the
   Building Lifecycle},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction industry's reliance on traditional methods and
   fragmented workflows results in significant information loss,
   inefficiencies, increased costs, and errors. This study addresses these
   issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building
   information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow
   throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that
   synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national
   and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and
   analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a
   conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and
   interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting
   open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for
   effective information exchange. By implementing an information model
   (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit
   processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory
   compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated
   information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction
   practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research
   illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize
   the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and
   fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust
   framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency
   and accuracy of construction processes.},

Journal = {JURNAL TEKNOLOGI},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {69-76},
Abstract = {Because of their characteristic attributes of storing all the
   information of a building and visualising the maintenance process of a
   project over its entire lifecycle, generating the automated control and
   monitoring of building diagnosis (e.g. component utilisation, component
   failure, etc.) as well as providing decision support for the choice of
   maintenance measures and the scheduling of maintenance, BIM technologies
   have a special appeal for the building maintenance profession. In spite
   of this appeal, there are currently very few operational BIM
   technologies in the field of IBS building maintenance. One reason for
   this may be a lack of awareness by the industry as to what BIM
   technologies currently exist and what their capabilities are. Presenting
   this information to the potential users in an easily scannable format is
   one of the objectives of this paper. A second objective of this effort
   is to present the characteristics of the state-of-the-art BIM
   technologies to researchers and industry practitioners. This information
   will help them in making a choice of the most appropriate tools and

Abstract = {Background: As the largest health care workforce, nursing is positioned
   to improve the health of populations using health information technology
   (HIT). Nurse graduates often lack confidence using HIT in practice,
   specifically, the electronic health record (EHR). Nurse scholars endorse
   the use of an academic electronic health record (AEHR) in nursing
   programs to provide students a safe learning platform to build levels of
   confidence using an EHR. Method: A quality improvement project was
   completed to evaluate student learning outcomes, satisfaction, and
   sustainability of an AEHR. Using an interprofessional approach, nurse
   educators incorporated the Systems Life Cycle Model to adopt an AEHR in
   two prelicensure nursing programs. Results: Students' levels of
   confidence using an EHR in clinical settings increased markedly.
   Satisfaction rates for using an AEHR were high. Conclusion: Integration
   of an AEHR in nursing education contributes to building a proficient
   nursing workforce confident in using HIT for health care quality.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a new paradigm in the
   Malaysian architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.
   BIM technology provides virtual models (including 3-D models) to
   generate a building's entire lifecycle. The model can also be used for
   analyzing design clashes, project scheduling, cost estimation, and
   facility management. The use of BIM in construction projects can reduce
   time to develop a project, reduce construction cost, and increase
   project quality. This paper aims to explore roles of BIM in the
   Malaysian construction industry. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with project consultants and BIM consultants involved in two
   government projects. The projects were the National Cancer Institute
   (NCI) Malaysia and Sultan Ibrahim Hall (formerly known as the
   Multipurpose Hall of Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, or UTHM). The
   interviews revealed effects of BIM in both projects and potential
   improvement in implementing BIM in construction projects in Malaysia. A
   literature review and the interviews revealed that BIM is increasingly
   used and accepted by construction players in Malaysia, and is expected
   to grow in future.},

Title = {Exploring the effects of several energy efficiency measures on the
   embodied/operational energy trade-off: A case study of swedish
   residential buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {283-296},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The building design process is crucial in efforts to implement
   energy-efficient practices by adopting Energy Efficiency Measures
   (EEMs). However, design choices based solely on reducing operational
   energy use can significantly increase a building's embodied energy and
   Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use, because there is a trade-off between
   embodied and operational energy. This article presents a case study in
   which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the effects of
   various EEMs on the aforementioned trade-off. Optimal solution(s) for
   six different building shapes (rectangular, H-, U-, L-, T- and
   cross-shaped) based on two sets of EEMs were investigated and compared.
   The first set of EEMs consisted of EEMs that can be implemented or
   modified during the early design phase, such as the building's shape,
   orientation, Window to Wall Ratio (WWR), and constituent materials. The
   second set comprised EEMs that can be implemented later in the design
   phase (i.e. EEMs relating to the constituent materials). The LCE
   reductions achieved by finding optimal solutions for EEMs in the first
   set (ranged from 2175.2 to 3803.8 GJ) were significantly (over 5 times)
   higher than those achieved for the second set (ranged from 418.6 to
   625.6 GJ) for all building shapes. Moreover, LCE use for
   pre-optimization building designs varied significantly with building
   shape. However, after optimization, the differences in LCE use between
   the optimal solutions of different building shapes were modest. This
   means that designers and construction companies can select building
   shapes based on customer requirements, but also highlights the
   importance of using multi-objective optimization during early design
   process to identify optimal combinations of EEMs that minimize LCE use.

Title = {Building Information Modeling Applications in Energy-Efficient
   Refurbishment of Existing Building Stock: A Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The built environment contributes to 35\% of the global energy
   consumption and 38\% of energy-related carbon emissions. The exponential
   population growth, coupled with the inability of the existing building
   stock to meet demands or reach the end of its lifespan, has precipitated
   the proliferation of new constructions worldwide. However, it has been
   proven well that retrofitting existing buildings might impact the
   environment less, save resources, and reduce the carbon footprint while
   extending their lifecycle. Various techniques are available to assess
   the performance of existing buildings and quantify the energy-saving
   potential of renovation measures. Building information modeling (BIM)
   technology serves as a virtual laboratory for buildings and can be used
   to model building stocks and measure how building performance changes
   with alternative envelope and system proposals. This research study
   explores the potential of BIM-based energy modeling to evaluate the
   effectiveness of refurbishment scenarios on a residential building. A
   total of 192 alternative scenarios were developed by considering six
   variables (wall, roofing, insulation, glazing, lighting power density,
   and photovoltaic panels). The results were analyzed across annual energy
   consumption (fuel and electric), annual/lifecycle energy costs, energy
   use intensity, annual CO2 emissions, and initial investment costs. The
   optimum alternative scenario decreased the annual fuel and electricity
   consumption of the sample building by 61\% and 64\%, respectively. The
   payback period was calculated as 12 years. This study demonstrates the
   impact of BIM in enhancing the energy efficiency of the existing
   building stock, presenting results within the context of a residential
   building.},

Title = {A systematic literature review of interoperability in the green Building
   Information Modeling lifecycle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {397-412},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The growing role of sustainability in the construction industry must be
   considered in the entire lifecycle of a building. This way BIM (Building
   Information Modeling) figures as an important factor in the management
   of this lifecycle, from design and construction, through the operation
   and maintenance until the demolition. An efficient interoperability
   along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management
   and help users to improve sustainability of projects. This
   interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be
   concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines,
   avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore,
   improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic
   literature review was performed considering sustainability factors,
   interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on
   existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis
   method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data
   analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied.
   Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in
   the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability
   in the entire lifecycle of sustainable buildings. Also, results showed
   the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability
   fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review
   can be used as a tool to organize knowledge and data and systematize
   processes and even to structure interoperability frameworks. (C) 2019

Title = {Models and scales for quality control: toward the definition of
   specifications (GOA-LOG) for the generation and re-use of HBIM object
   libraries in a Common Data Environment},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 MAR 5},
Abstract = {The paper focuses on new opportunities of knowledge sharing, and
   comparison, thanks to the circulation and re-use of heritage HBIM models
   by means of Object Libraries within a Common Data Environment (CDE) and
   remotely-accessible Geospatial Virtual Hubs (GVH). HBIM requires a
   transparent controlled quality process in the model generation and its
   management to avoid misuses of such models once available in the cloud,
   freeing themselves from object libraries oriented to new buildings. The
   model concept in the BIM construction process is intended to be
   progressively enriched with details defined by the Level of Geometry
   (LOG) while crossing the different phases of development (LOD), from the
   pre-design to the scheduled maintenance during the long life cycle of
   buildings and management (LLCM). In this context, the digitization
   process-from the data acquisition until the informative models
   (scan-to-HBIM method)-requires adapting the definition of LOGs to the
   different phases characterizing the heritage preservation and
   management, reversing the new construction logic based on
   simple-to-complex informative models. Accordingly, a deeper
   understanding of the geometry and state of the art (as-found) should
   take into account the complexity and uniqueness of the elements
   composing the architectural heritage since the starting phases of the
   analysis, adopting coherent object modeling that can be simplified for
   different purposes as in the construction site and management over time.
   For those reasons, the study intends (i) to apply the well-known concept
   of scale to the object model generation, defining different Grades of
   Accuracy (GOA) related to the scales (ii) to start fixing sustainable
   roles to guarantee a free choice by the operators in the generation of
   object models, and (iii) to validate the model generative process with a
   transparent communication of indicators to describe the richness in
   terms of precision and accuracy of the geometric content here declined
   for masonry walls and vaults, and (iv) to identifies requirements for
   reliable Object Libraries.},

Abstract = {Workplace safety is significant to the construction industry throughout
   the world. Despite rigorous efforts of safety professionals and strong
   governmental enforcement of safety laws and regulations, there has not
   been a significant decline in fatalities, injuries and illnesses in the
   construction industry. Extensive research on this topic has indicated
   that the dynamic nature of the construction industry is one of the main
   reasons. Each construction project is unique and identifying all
   possible hazards and safety risks is always challenging. In recent years
   there has been a significant increase in the use of visualization
   technologies in different phases of the construction project life cycle.
   Visualization technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   4D simulations, and 3D Immersive Virtual Reality Environments can result
   in improved occupational safety by allowing architects, engineers, and
   contractors to visually assess jobsite conditions and recognize possible
   hazards before the construction proceeds. This paper presents three case
   studies that investigated the effectiveness of above-mentioned
   visualization technologies in developing, communicating and implementing
   construction site safety plans. The case studies results indicated that
   3D/4D dynamic tools are more effective in safety planning and management
   as compared to the 2D static drawings because they closely simulate the
   actual jobsite conditions. In addition, the visualization technologies
   are found to be very effective in construction safety education and
   training in both formal and informal settings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {Challenges in the harmonisation and digitalisation of Environmental
   Product Declarations for construction products in the European context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {PurposeIn the last decade, efforts have multiplied to develop and refine
   a framework for converting human-readable to machine-readable
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). Still, the fast growth of the
   topic created several issues. These are mostly due to changing policy
   landscape, numerous parallel initiatives, and the difficulty of
   providing a tamper- and mistake-proof schema due to the huge size of the
   challenge.MethodThis work objectively analyses and discusses challenges
   in the harmonisation and digitalisation of EPDs for construction
   products in the European context. By inspecting 3286 available datasets
   on the largest European aggregator of EPDs, the trends, issues, and
   opportunities are identified on a per data field basis.Results and
   discussionPreparation of the data for analysis disclosed several
   significant inconsistencies within the datasets. The study of data
   fields addressing contextualization of use exposed the heterogeneity in
   implementing guidelines by different Programme Operators (POs).
   Regarding the data fields addressing LCA impacts evaluation, the
   datasets compliant with EN 15804:A2-2019 seem to be short of
   expectations regarding their aims, particularly reporting end-of-life
   cycle stages impacts. The correlation analysis between environmental
   impact indicators points to strong and statistically significant
   coefficients and the existence of behavioural patterns for certain
   groups, which question the relevance of reporting such a wide range of
   impact indicators. The reduction of their number could lead to faster
   adoption by the industry and a higher proliferation of this LCA
   instrument by curtailing entry costs.ConclusionsWhile the available
   volume of data portrays a seemingly homogeneous structure, reality does
   not follow. The sheer extent of the challenge, the multiple distinct
   initiatives, and the realized loosely enforced digital format schema
   seem to have contributed to a quite heterogeneous bundle of aggregated
   data. Future works should explore the application of data templates for
   the use of EPDs in digital processes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a research project involving a new
   urban development project in the city of Vienna. Given the expected long
   life-cycle of this project, the developers requested
   scientifically-based information concerning the projected extent of the
   microclimatic changes in the development area and their potential
   ramifications for open urban spaces and the planned buildings' energy
   and thermal performance. To address this inquiry, the first stage of the
   research involved capturing both the current state and future
   projections of the climatic conditions of the area. As a next step
   building performance simulation models were used to evaluate alternative
   building designs (specifically various surface and layout design options
   and degrees of vegetation) in view of their mitigation effectiveness
   vis-a-vis climate change projections. The simulated implications of the
   assumed climate change trend suggest that the future heating loads will
   be lower, whereas cooling loads will significantly increase. The results
   help providing qualified estimations of the extent to which certain
   surface and building design features influence future cooling and
   heating loads. Furthermore results show the importance of taking
   microclimatic conditions of the relevant area into account. (C) 2014

Title = {Developing a systematic framework for integrating life cycle carbon
   emission assessment in urban building energy modeling},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {260},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted in recent years on the
   environmental evaluation of building lifecycles, spanning construction,
   usage, and end-of-life phases. This holistic approach shows promise in
   assisting cities to achieve decarbonization goals, given the significant
   carbon emissions attributed to buildings in urban areas. Prior efforts
   have successfully utilized Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) tools
   to assess city-scale building energy consumption and explore energy
   efficiency scenarios. However, the integration of Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) with UBEM, a robust environmental assessment approach, remains
   underexplored. The combination of LCA and UBEM can provide a
   comprehensive understanding of a building's environmental impact,
   considering energy performance as well as broader considerations such as
   materials, construction processes, and waste management. Despite the
   evident benefits, there exists a research gap in fully harnessing the
   potential of integrating LCA and UBEM methodologies. Further
   investigation is thus warranted to unlock the synergies between these
   approaches, establishing an integrated framework that enhances
   sustainability assessments and informs decision-making in the built
   environment. A systematic approach is essential to address the
   challenges associated with the development of a city-scale environmental
   tool. This entails defining the challenges, identifying key components,
   establishing a structured framework, and testing and refining it through
   iterations. The defined framework should be implemented in modeling
   tools that offer a compatible environment. To address this need, this
   study proposes a systematic approach to the development of a framework
   for the integration of LCA into UBEM tools. Firstly, a structured
   procedure is defined to facilitate the systematic creation of the
   integrated framework. This procedure serves as a guide for developers to
   adopt a comprehensive and organized approach in addressing the
   challenges of combining LCA and UBEM methodologies. Subsequently, a
   workflow is designed to accommodate the implementation of any
   improvement practices within the defined systematic process of
   integrating LCA into UBEM tools. Applying the developed workflow in a
   real case study in Montreal, Canada, reveals that embodied carbon
   emissions can actually be higher than operational emissions, when the
   energy supply is renewable (hydropower). The outcomes of this research
   are expected to provide guidance for future studies on Urban Building
   Environmental Assessment (UBEA), facilitating a structured approach to
   advance and improve the field.},

Abstract = {Purpose The possibility of integrating building information in an
   augmented reality (AR) environment provides an effective solution to all
   phases of a building's lifecycle. This paper explores the integration of
   building information modelling (BIM) and AR to effectively visualise
   building information models in an AR environment and evaluates the
   currently available AR tools. Design/methodology/approach A BIM model of
   a selected office room was created and superimposed to the actual
   physical space using two different AR devices and four different AR
   applications. The superimposing techniques, accuracy and the level of
   information that can be visualised were then investigated by performing
   a walk-through analysis. Findings From the investigation, it can be
   concluded that model positioning can be inaccurate depending on the
   superimposing method used and the AR device. Moreover, using the
   currently available techniques, only static building information can be
   superimposed and visualised in AR, showing a need to integrate data from
   Internet of Things (IoT) sensors into the current BIM-AR processes to
   allow visualisation of accurate and high-quality operational building
   information. Originality/value A practical process and method for
   visualising and superimposing BIM models in an AR environment have been
   described. Recommendations to improve superimposing accuracy are
   provided. The assessment of type, quality and level of detail that can
   be visualised indicates the areas that need improvement to increase the
   effectiveness of building information's visualisation in AR.},

Title = {Investigating the Crucial Aspects of Developing a Healthy Dormitory
   based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs-A Case Study of Shenzhen},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the development of green building and the increase
   of health awareness, the concept of healthy building has been proposed.
   Recently, studies have been made on developing healthy residential
   buildings; however, few attentions have been paid to the development of
   healthy dormitories. To bridge this research gap, this paper aims to
   investigate the crucial aspects of developing a healthy dormitory. Based
   on the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, three influencing aspects which
   include 17 measurement indicators are identified. Questionnaire surveys
   are subsequently conducted to collect students' perceptions on the
   identified indicators. After a structural equation modeling (SEM)
   analysis, the relationships between the three influencing aspects are
   analyzed. The research findings show that building performance, bodily
   sensation, and humanistic environment must be taken into account in the
   development of a healthy dormitory. In addition, it is revealed that
   building performance has a significant impact on bodily sensation, while
   bodily sensation has a significant impact on humanistic environment.
   However, building performance is found having little impact on
   humanistic environment. The findings of this study could provide useful
   information for the construction of healthy dormitories.},

Title = {A novel lightweight CF decision-making approach for highway
   reconstruction and operation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {434},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Road infrastructure is a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs),
   contributing significantly to the overall carbon emissions of many
   countries. Due to their importance in the life-cycle carbon footprint
   (CF) assessment of highway projects, highway reconstruction,
   rehabilitation, and operation have garnered increased attention.
   Existing highway CF studies have relied heavily on on-site data. They
   were often limited by a handful of operation or reconstruction
   scenarios. Most existing highway CF studies focused solely on mitigating
   the infrastructure CF and ignored the potential savings of highway
   traffic CF resulting from different traffic behaviour and technology
   options. A comprehensive CF saving potential comparison between the
   highway infrastructure and traffic for the city- or nation-wide policy
   decision-making is needed. Moreover, the loss of design and operation
   information for many existing highway projects with long operational
   periods necessitates a new approach to assess and manage the CF of
   highway reconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation. As a result, this
   study has proposed a new lightweight CF decision-making approach to help
   highway reconstruction, rehabilitation, and traffic operation management
   with informative stage-based highway decision-making supporting
   framework and digital platform that enable the comparison between
   highway infrastructure and traffic CF's potential savings. With the help
   of the developed framework and platform, the project decision-maker and
   government policymaker can leverage better information support and
   dynamically compare CF decision-making scenarios regarding different
   highway infrastructure and traffic options. This study contributes to
   knowledge in three ways: (1) evaluating and validating an informative
   highway CF decision-making framework for highway infrastructure and
   traffic assessment and management, (2) proving the applicability of
   using a lightweight data collection and model building method for
   highway infrastructure CF assessment and management practice, and (3)
   providing an applicable way of building a highway CF digital twins (DT)
   platform for visualisation, decisionmaking, and management of the
   highway infrastructure and traffic.},

Abstract = {It has long been recognized by the industry practitioners that how well
   preproject planning is conducted has a great impact on project outcome.
   Through industry project data collection and model analysis, this
   research intends to investigate the relationship between preproject
   planning and project success. Preproject planning and project
   performance information from 62 industrial projects and 78 building
   projects, representing approximately \$5 billion U.S.D. in total
   construction cost, is collected and used for this research analysis.
   Based on the information obtained, preproject planning is identified as
   having direct impact on the project success (cost and schedule
   performance). Two techniques were then used to develop models for
   predicting cost and schedule performance: statistical regression
   analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The research results
   provide a valuable source of information that supports better planning
   in the early stage of the project life cycle and have positive impact on
   the final project outcome. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a revolutionary
   innovation in the construction industry to virtually design and mange
   projects throughout the building lifecycle. Although Estonia is one of
   the foremost countries in the Information and Communications Technology
   (ICT) sector, BIM adoption in the Estonian construction industry is
   still lagging behind other countries. This paper is part of doctoral
   research that aims to determine the barriers to BIM adoption and develop
   a framework for effective implementation of BIM in the Estonian
   construction industry. The purpose of this paper is to examine the
   status of BIM adoption, BIMbenefits and common barriers to BIM adoption
   in the construction industry worldwide.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The methodology used in this study is a
   literature review of journal articles, conference proceedings and
   published reports from various sources.
   Findings - This study showed BIM benefits through building lifecycle
   phases and explored the BIM adoption rate in the construction industry
   of various countries. Eighteen barriers to BIM adoption were also
   identified.
   Research Limitations/Implications - The study presented is limited to a
   literature review - some related literature may have been missed.
   Practical Implications - The main practical significance of this study
   is that the findings can be used to inform a further survey to model the
   barriers to BIM adoption in the Estonian construction industry.
   Originality/Value - This study offers information on BIM adoption in the
   construction industry and will form the basis of further research.},

   transition: A case study for the Netherlands},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {306},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The building sector plays a key role in energy transition and carbon
   reduction while capturing the dynamic characteristics (e.g. materials,
   energy performance, and environmental impact) of building stock is a
   great challenge during the gradual process. This study presents a
   bottom-up dynamic building stock model that links dynamic material flow
   analysis with building energy modeling. The environmental impact of
   material and energy requirements is assessed by considering future
   electricity mix. The model is applied to evaluate the pathways to the
   climate-neutral energy supply of residential building stock in the
   Netherlands by 2050. Results show that space heating demand decreases by
   about 2/3 by 2050, while the energy for hot water increases to 92\% of
   space heating demand. 80\% of public grid electricity for appliances and
   lighting can be potentially substituted if rooftop photovoltaic (PV)
   systems are installed on 50\% of renovated buildings and all the new
   buildings. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of operational energy are
   reduced by approximately 60-90\%, depending on the electricity mix.
   Annual GHG emissions from material production are not as important as
   those related to operational energy. Insulation materials account for a
   large proportion of the carbon footprint of material production. The
   model has a high spatial and temporal resolution and can be linked with
   local energy source availability (e.g. buildings or neighborhoods) to
   provide more accurate support for policymaking.},

   often exceed estimated costs and time. Therefore, enterprises in this
   sector rethink and improve their processes. For addressing this
   challenge, the discipline of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   developed new process models to optimize the lifecycle of structures by
   leveraging technology and data sharing. Recently, enterprises explored
   the use of IoT technology for generating valid and up-to-date data. In
   this paper, we present an IoT capabilities map for BIM. This map employs
   BIM phases and capabilities to provide a structured overview of use
   cases from the literature and an empirical study we conducted in the
   rail construction sector. The map helps to guide further research in
   this area and provides blueprints for companies in the construction
   industry that seek to make use of IoT for improving their processes.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather and cyber-attacks can cause power grid outages affecting
   thousands of buildings at a time, with long term economic consequences.
   Understanding the ability of commercial buildings to sustain their own
   critical energy load during grid outages is a necessary step in
   designing more energy resilient buildings. This study modeled commercial
   building sites nationwide and measured the expected resilience provided
   by distributed energy resources such as solar power and battery storage.
   Each of the 800 locations was configured with two building types, two
   outage scenarios, and solar and solar-plus-storage technology. Each
   configuration was then modeled using the REopt Lite design tool to
   determine the optimal sizing of energy resources to maintain the
   critical energy load during the outage at the lowest cost. Mean
   resilience hours and change in life cycle costs were summarized by
   climate zone. This survey indicated that solar power alone provided on
   average 2.1 hours of resilience, while solar-plus- storage provided on
   average 69.2 hours of resilience, and that sites with the greatest
   resilience and most savings were in climate zone.t-motst (Puerto Rico,
   Hawaii, Southern Florida). This information will aid building managers
   in planning sites with maximum energy resilience to prepare for future
   power grid outages.},

Title = {Suppliers' software development project start-up practices},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {880-896},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a life cycle phase of
   a software development project which is substantial for the success of
   the project. This paper visualizes the project start-up phase from
   suppliers' perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach - The method is a theory building from case
   studies. The data were collected from three software supplier firms by
   conducting process modeling separately in each firm.
   Findings - The study resulted in a model of a supplier's software
   project start-up which includes start-up practices and involved roles.
   The results indicate that project start-up is an integral and structured
   phase of project life cycle, which influences the execution of a
   software development project, especially from the supplier's perspective
   in the project business context.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on the start-up
   phase of software development projects delivered to external customers.
   Therefore, developed project start-up model is applicable as such in
   software supplier firms.
   Practical implications - The project start-up model presented in this
   paper indicates that project start-up is a complex and multi-dimensional
   activity in a supplier firm. This study suggests that if the project
   start-up phase is clearly defined, planned and followed in a supplier
   firm, it reduces confusion and miscommunication among the people
   involved in the project and helps to achieve the business goals of a
   project.
   Originality/value - This study emphasizes that it is necessary to make a
   distinction between the perspectives of the customer and the supplier
   when studying projects in the project business context. The findings
   contribute the new knowledge for managing outsourced software
   development projects.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process by which a digital
   representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a
   facility are built, analyzed, documented and assessed virtually, then
   revised iteratively until the optimal model is documented. The virtual
   BIM model is not only graphical design but also a virtual database which
   includes the management data. So the construction manager (CM) can use
   BIM as a real simulation of the actual project. However, there is
   ambiguity about the compatibility of the traditional CM duties and
   responsibilities and BIM.
   This study looked into the construction management body of knowledge
   under twelve main subjects relative to the functions of BIM. It was
   determined that BIM is effective in the most critical phases of a
   project's lifecycle. The duties and responsibilities of the CM must be
   updated to improve CMs' efficiency in BIM-based projects.},

Abstract = {A key application of Building Information Modeling is the optimization
   of collaboration between project participants in a construction project.
   This article focuses on the application of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) in the facility management of the chemical and pharmaceutical
   industry in Germany. BIM is currently being increasingly used in
   construction projects, but its application mostly pertains to the
   planning and construction phase. The requirements of the operational
   phase are often not considered during the planning phase, even though 80
   \% of the costs in the building's operational phase are attributed to
   facility management (FM). There are growing efforts to apply the digital
   building model in facility management in order to enable more efficient
   processes throughout the building's lifecycle. Due to significant
   potential for optimization, research is increasingly addressing
   solutions; however, up to the current point, there are no established
   uniform standards. In collaboration with industry partners, information
   requirements for BIM in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry have
   been derived from the perspective of facility management.},

Abstract = {The paper outlines the development of a prototype cyber-physical data
   exchange system that connects RFID, BIM and the Cloud based data
   platform by which reusable building components may be identified,

   ongoing Product-Service System (PSS) relationship between
   suppliers/providers and users/clients. This enables advanced services
   for reuse of building components at the highest value and with mutual
   benefits. Via an integration of the ICT-based data management and PSS,
   the types of life cycle, performance, cost and other data required for
   service relationships can be identified so that suppliers may manage
   building components over their extended life, retain their optimum value
   and find new profit centres. Clients can be assured that the quality and
   performance of reused components meet required service expectations,
   coupled with savings in cost and carbon. An example of internal glazed

Abstract = {According to the problems in Chinese enterprise technology innovation, a
   concept of smarter enterprise innovation network was proposed, which has
   three characteristics: (1) The value of knowledge, information for
   experts inside and outside enterprise, information of the market changes
   and user's demand are more insightfully perceived; (2) The information
   among the knowledge life cycle, internal and external enterprise
   knowledge, behavior of employee knowledge sharing and innovation
   activities, knowledge suppliers and demanders, knowledge and the
   innovation process are communicated much comprehensively; (3) Knowledge
   management system become more intelligent though building the dynamic
   relationship between the knowledge and persons, which means the more
   usage of the system, the smarter it would be. Implementation methods for
   the smarter enterprise innovation network were presented: (1) Managing,
   tracking and monitoring the life cycle of the knowledge: According to
   the knowledge application result, the appropriate incentives are given
   to knowledge contributors; Evaluation of knowledge and staffs is
   combined, so that the knowledge network will be more ordered, and people
   will take part in construction and evaluation of knowledge network much
   responsibly and actively;(2) Rely on public assessment of knowledge:
   organizing related staffs to vote some knowledge for a particular
   evaluation; knowledge evaluation based on Wikipedia (Wiki) model;
   evaluation knowledge based on behavior of knowledge application by
   staff; (3) Combining the knowledge evaluation with the daily use of
   knowledge. There are some problems need to pay attention to: scoring
   standards for the behaviors of daily knowledge application; knowledge
   evaluation strategy for some possible cheating behaviors; knowledge
   evaluation strategy for some possible negative behaviors. The system
   based on this concept has been partly applied in a certain research

Title = {A type-2 fuzzy system-based approach for image data fusion to create
   building information models},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a standard digital process that
   fuses buildings information from different sources into a 3D model
   during their lifecycle. For new construction sites using BIM, it is
   possible to monitor the cost, schedule, and changes throughout the
   lifecycle; however, existing buildings do not have a BIM model. Manually
   creating the BIM models for existing buildings is a high-cost task, both
   in time and money, hence there is a need for extracting information from
   available paper-based documentation and fuse it into a BIM model. The
   struggle of facility management and utility companies to fully adopt a
   BIM process (due to their high volumes of paper-based documentation of
   existing buildings) has led to the research on creating these 3D BIM
   models from 2D floor plan images.
   This paper presents a novel processing pipeline to extract 2D digital
   information from floorplans, fusing it into a 3D BIM model. The work
   focuses on fusing the available information to create the structure of
   the building in BIM format, which is considered the essential step
   before looking on working with other sources of data. In this process,
   we introduce a type-2 fuzzy logic based Explainable Artificial
   Intelligence (XAI) approach for the semantic segmentation step. The
   approach consists of using the outputs of type-2 fuzzy logic systems to
   classify a pixel as wall or background, by using information around and
   from the pixel of interest as the inputs to the system. After the
   semantic segmentation step, the output of the type-2 fuzzy logic goes
   through a noise removal process and finally a transformation from 2D to
   3D by assigning the corresponding BIM tag to each identified element.
   The proposed type-2 fuzzy logic semantic segmentation approach produced
   comparable results (97.3\% mean Intersection over Union (IoU)
   performance metric value) to the opaque box model approach based on

Title = {Evaluating sustainable retrofits in existing buildings under uncertainty},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative approach to determining the value of
   the investment in sustainable retrofits for existing buildings by taking
   into account different uncertainties associated with the life cycle
   costs and perceived benefits of the investment. To achieve this
   objective, principles from modern option pricing theory in finance are
   used to augment the traditional net present value method. In particular,
   an analogy between investment in sustainable building retrofits and
   American option is established and used to develop a framework for
   single or multi-phase investment evaluation. The parameters of the
   proposed framework are determined using the capital asset pricing model.
   The case study example illustrates that the proposed methodology
   provides the decision maker with managerial flexibility to determine,
   prioritize and evaluate the required retrofits over time. Retrofit
   measures that can be implemented without delay are distinguished from
   those that can be delayed because more information can be obtained in
   the future, or their implementation is contingent on successfully
   implementing other retrofit measures first. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Development and application of a framework for managing school
   buildings: A case study in New Zealand},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Managing school buildings is critical for any community because the
   buildings are not only supposed to provide a pleasant and safe
   environment for staff and students, but they are also a clearly visible
   representation of the education system. Therefore, it is important to
   ensure that school buildings are well managed through their life cycle.
   However, managing school buildings is challenging due to various
   reasons. This study aims to develop a framework that can help solve
   challenges in managing school buildings and illustrate the benefit of
   this framework using schools in New Zealand as a case study. The primary
   data of this research was collected through 34 semi-structured
   interviews with schools' top managers in two phases: Phase 1 (16
   interviews) to identify the challenges that schools are facing in
   managing their buildings; Phase 2 (18 interviews) to verify and validate
   the new framework for managing school buildings in NZ. The findings
   reveal that building maintenance in NZ lacks a shared vision, competent
   people, resources, information management, and performance evaluation.
   The findings of this study contribute to the broader discussion of
   managing existing buildings by promoting communication, training,
   information collection, and lesson sharing. This study also proposes
   recommendations on how to implement the framework to achieve effective
   and efficient management of school buildings. Findings of this study can
   be used as guidance for school stakeholders to manage their buildings
   effectively and can be adjusted to be used for other types of buildings.},

Title = {Integrated post-occupancy evaluation and intervention that achieve
   real-world zero-carbon buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {303},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Many building standards are available worldwide to support sustainable
   building design. However, most of them only define compliance before
   occupancy, overlooking the real building usage and its implications for
   meeting zero-carbon targets. This research proposes a systematic
   post-occupancy evaluation and intervention (POEI) protocol to analyse
   real building performance and support cost-effective and zero-carbon
   upgrading. The novelty lies in integrating novel diagnostic data science
   techniques to identify performance gaps, advanced physicsdriven energy
   modelling iteratively calibrated with POE data to disaggregate energy
   use by end-use, and costoptimal intervention analysis. The POEI protocol
   has been validated in a university building. The results demonstrated
   the POEI benefits for the cost-optimal upgrading of in-use building
   assets based on real needs. By optimising control, reducing demand,
   increasing efficiency, and implementing renewables, the building can
   reach the nearly zero-carbon building target with a payback period of 13
   years and a 23 \% lower life-cycle cost compared to the baseline
   scenario. Building energy management interventions were identified as
   the most important actions to reduce the performance gap, reducing
   energy consumption by 20 \% and carbon emissions by 24 \%. The results
   also highlight the critical role of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT), which may represent up to 49 \% of energy use in the
   future zero-carbon building scenario if overlooked.},

Abstract = {Buildings account for significant carbon dioxide emissions, both in
   construction and operation. Governments around the world are setting
   targets and legislating to reduce the carbon emissions related to the
   built environment. Challenges presented by increasingly rigorous
   standards for construction projects will mean a paradigm shift in how
   new buildings are designed and managed. This will lead to the need for
   computational modelling and visualization of buildings and their energy
   performance throughout the life-cycle of the building.
   This paper briefly outline how the UK government is planning to reduce
   carbon emissions for new buildings. It discusses the challenges faced by
   the architectural, construction and building management professions in
   adjusting to the proposed requirements for low or zero carbon buildings.
   It then outlines how software tools, including the use of visualization
   tools, could develop to support the designer, contractor and user.},

Title = {Cost-Benefit Framework to Generate Wind Hazard Mitigation
   Recommendations for Homeowners},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wind hazards are responsible for the majority of hazard losses in the
   United States; however, little customized information is available to
   provide actionable information to homeowners to support individual
   mitigation decision making. Therefore, there is a need for decision
   support tools to calculate, evaluate, and present the economic benefits
   of mitigation over variable decision-making time horizons for unique
   building configurations in specific geographical locations. This paper
   presents a mitigation recommendation framework that is based on
   comparison of the economic effectiveness of multiple mitigation
   scenarios to identify and recommend those with the highest net benefit,
   NB, and net benefit to lifecycle cost ratio, NBCR. The framework is
   focused on supporting homeowner decision making through reliance on key
   inputs, such as mitigation budget and decision-making time horizon,
   along with specification of building attributes and location. The
   intended audience of this paper is researchers, design professionals,
   and loss modelers familiar with basic concepts of wind engineering and
   loss modeling who are interested in the development of tools and methods
   that support owner-centered adaptation approaches to resilience. To
   demonstrate the framework, retrofit mitigation of a wood-framed single
   family home is considered with a \$15,000 budget and a decision-making
   time horizon of 30 years. The case study resulted in 10 acceptable
   mitigation options with construction costs ranging between \$1,700 and
   \$15,098 and NB ranging between \$1,024 and \$39,520. (c) 2017 American

Abstract = {The demands on factory planing as a industrial planing service are
   growing. The life cycles of real assets are shortening. Therefore the
   industrial enterprises as a costumer of factory planning services
   specify their demands on modifications and new building of factories at
   a later date. So working with uncertain information becomes more common.
   Furthermore the timeframe set by the costumer for the planing and
   building of factories shortens. Due to the changing demands on factory
   project work it gets increasingly harder to implement the required
   services in time and to the costs permitted. Thus it is more difficult
   to ensure the quality of the results. Against the background of this
   difficulty a model of service enterprises was developed. This model
   shows the essiantial fields of formation of the organizational
   development. It can also be used as a frame of reference for the
   analysis, evaluation and formation of organization at service
   enterprises. Furthermore the model shows the practitioner the main
   variables, which he can use to influence the quality of the results of a
   service enterprise.},

   DOCUMENTATION WITH AN ADVANCED REPRESENTATION INFORMATION REPOSITORY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {596-611},
Abstract = {The long-term usability of digital building documentation is essential
   for the maintenance and optimization of infrastructure portfolios. It
   supports the preservation of building-specific knowledge and the
   cultural heritage hidden within. However, having to do this throughout
   the entire lifecycle of a building-or even indefinitely-remains a major
   challenge. This is especially true for organizations responsible for
   large collections of digital building documents and datasets, such as
   public administrations or archives. In this article, we first describe
   the challenges and requirements associated with preservation tasks and
   then introduce the concept of representation information within Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and all types of related data and documents.
   This type of information is important to give meaning to the stored bit
   sequences for a particular community. We then design a repository for
   representation information and propose some 23 so-called BIM Core
   content elements. Finally, we focus on BIM and the construction sector
   and explain how the proposed repository can be used to implement the two
   concepts introduced in the ISO reference model Open Archival Information
   System (OAIS), namely the representation information and the context
   information, as well as the concept of significant properties, which has
   not yet been explicitly modeled in OAIS.},

Abstract = {For various reasons, the advances in progressive die design remain too
   slow compared with the increasing importance of progressive dies in
   modern industry. Aimed at speeding up the design process, HPRODIE, an
   integrated CAD/CAM system for progressive dies, was developed. In
   HPRODIE, three features-the product feature for the representation of
   sheet metal parts, the stamping process feature for the strip layout,
   and the die design feature for building the die assembly model-are
   introduced respectively to represent three life-cycle aspects of sheet
   metal parts. Feature mapping methods are employed to transfer the design
   information between different design stages at high-level semantics.
   With feature modelling and feature mapping, most of design processes can
   be carried out automatically. The testing results have shown that the
   design cycle has been cut down significantly by using this system.},

Abstract = {Bridges are one of the most important elements of a sustainable
   transportation infrastructure network and require significant care to
   guarantee they function in a safe and reliable manner. Ensuring
   effective bridge maintenance and life cycle management in the face of
   aging and deterioration requires precise performance data and efficient
   assessment technologies. Because of the overall mediocre quality of U.S.
   infrastructure, there is a crucial need to enhance its monitoring and
   management. Digital twin is an emerging and promising concept that can
   offer the required solution. Advances in sensors, computing,
   communications, and predictive data analytics, coupled with biannual
   inspections, offer a wealth of bridge assessment data that will need a
   centralized digital twin framework for integration, analysis, and
   optimal decision-making with regard to maintenance. Leveraging and
   integrating these technologies in the new paradigm of a bridge digital
   twin will provide state transportation agencies with additional
   resources not previously available to enhance bridge operation and
   maintenance. A major value of a digital twin is the new knowledge
   created by the integration of information resources. This paper provides
   a framework for bridge digital twin that incorporates existing
   technologies, namely, building information modeling, structural health
   monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and geographic
   information systems. The paper also provides an overview of practical
   applications and use cases of digital twin for bridges and structures,
   and offers an assessment of the challenges posed by the technology.},

Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {707-712},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The intention here is to provide a parametric global model for
   generating element alternatives in conjunction with an evaluation
   procedure to ascertain the best overall performer. Any information
   pertaining to an object may be encompassed within a conceptual
   parametric model thereby allowing efficient manipulation for all
   purposes. The model enshrines three subsystems. 1. Performance
   requirements comprising the notional entities of life cycle phases,
   Participants and domains with their respective entities. 2. Design
   constraints as exogenous factors predicating the requirements indexed to
   instances. 3. Building objects as elements and their components
   described by object oriented modeling. The comparative performance
   evaluation procedure for element alternatives comprises two consecutive
   parts called physical and statistical evaluation. They employ the same
   procedure but physical and statistical criteria are substituted,
   respectively. Thus the distribution of the criteria values for each
   alternative is accounted for and a rank-ordered shortlist of
   satisfactory alternatives may be prepared. Generation of alternatives
   entails the combinatorial steps of Arrangement of components, Material
   of components, Form of components. An application is included for the
   purpose of demonstrating the proposal. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {Cloud-based computing services trend has significantly increased the
   building of new cloud data centres in the recent times. These data

   making the cloud computing systems more energy efficient and the ICT a
   green and sustainable development ecosystem. The Green Cloud Computing
   will be considered as an implementation platform for the proposed

Abstract = {The long-term lifecycle-related management of digital building
   information is essential to improve the overall quality of public built
   assets. However, this management task still poses great challenges for
   building authorities, as they are usually responsible for large,
   heterogeneous and long-lived built assets with countless of data sets
   and documents that are increasingly changing from analogue to digital
   representations. These digital collections are characterized by complex
   dependencies, by numerous different, sometimes highly specialized and
   proprietary formats and also by their inappropriate organization. The
   major challenge is to ensure completeness, consistency and usability
   over the entire lifecycle of buildings or their associated digital data
   and documents.
   In this paper, we present an approach for a holistic and standard-based
   concept for a technical and organizational solution in building
   authorities. Holistic means integrating concepts for the long-term
   usability of digital building information, taking into account the
   framework conditions described in building authorities, including the
   introduction of BIM (building information modeling). To this end, we
   outline how the concepts of the consolidated and widely accepted
   ISO-standardized reference model OAIS (open archive information system)
   can be applied to a building-specific information architecture.
   First, we sketch the history of electronic data processing in the
   building sector and introduce the essential concepts of OAIS. Then, we
   illustrate typical major actors and their (future) IT systems, including
   systems intended for OAIS-compliant long-term usability. Next, we
   outline major (future) software components and their interactions and
   assignment to lifecycle phases. Finally, we delineate how the generic
   information model of OAIS can be used.
   In summary, ensuring the long-term usability of digital information in
   the building sector will remain a grand challenge, but our proposed
   approach to the systematic application and further refinement of the
   OAIS reference model can help to better organize future discussions as
   well as research, development and implementation activities. We conclude
   with some suggestions for further research based on the concepts of the
   OAIS reference model, such as refining information models or developing
   information repositories needed for long-term interpretation of digital
   objects.},

Abstract = {It becomes a widely accepted consensus that every human activity has to
   be designed or redesigned from the viewpoint of the sustainability. In
   the field of product manufacturing, development and improvement of
   products and manufacturing processes that reduce environmental impacts
   become very important issues and their implementation has become a
   mandatory as a public concern on environmental impacts of manufacturing
   industries heightened. In order to support those activities for
   sustainability, an evaluation of environmental impacts (e.g. global
   warming, ozone layer depletion) of new products and new processes are
   crucial. This paper proposes an expansion of technological information
   infrastructure concept and defines process units that are basic building
   blocks of recycling systems. The proposed scheme is a basis for life
   cycle engineering and enables a model-based engineering and a PDCA

Title = {Optimal planning of a rooftop PV system using GIS-based reinforcement
   learning},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {298},

Abstract = {This study aimed to develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based
   reinforcement learning (RL) model for optimal planning of a rooftop PV
   system, considering the uncertainty of future scenarios throughout the
   life cycle of buildings. To that end, GIS was used to establish the
   spatial data for the rooftop PV installation, and an RL model was
   developed to maximize the economic profit of the rooftop PV installation
   in various locations and future scenarios. The developed model was
   applied to residential buildings in Nonhyeon district, South Korea to
   evaluate their economic profitability and to compare the model with the
   existing planning methods. With the use of the developed GIS-based RL
   model, the rooftop PV system became economically feasible, achieving
   average economic profit of 539,197 USD over all scenarios for all target
   buildings which was higher than that of the existing models by 4.4\% and
   4.3\%. Furthermore, the developed model outperformed the existing models
   especially in volatile scenarios with lower solar radiation. Therefore,
   the use of the proposed GIS-based RL model can optimize the economic
   feasibility of rooftop PV systems for buildings, which will benefit
   building owners and community-level energy business owners. In
   conclusion, the developed model can promote the adoption of rooftop PV
   systems, which have 91.8\% lower global warming potential than the
   Korean mixed grid, without additional subsidies to achieve Korea's
   national CO2 emission reduction plan.},

Title = {A Strategy for Building Design Quality Improvement through BIM
   Capability Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been proven to bring noticeable
   benefits to the lifecycle of buildings. Thus, construction organizations
   have increasingly leveraged BIM in their projects. Even though BIM
   benefits the design process by generating an accurate 3D model,
   conducting automatic clash detection, and providing an online platform
   for effective coordination, BIM is not yet capable of addressing certain
   aspects of the design process. In this paper, the authors present an
   in-depth examination of design quality management capabilities of BIM in
   building projects. By analyzing 160 leading indicators of high priority
   design defects, the authors identify the relationship between design
   quality drivers and BIM capabilities. To promote proactive design defect
   mitigation strategies, the authors explore non-BIM-supported leading
   indicators, analyzing timing of the indicators within the design process
   and their associated design defects, and considering the impact scores
   of these design defects. Lastly, the authors propose future directions
   of BIM advancement for design quality improvement. This study
   contributes to the body of knowledge in the design quality research
   domain by exploring the limitations of BIM with respect to design
   quality. Furthermore, it enables industry practitioners using BIM to
   plan appropriate actions for design defect prevention, and it suggests
   future technology development.},

Abstract = {Several important goals for Urban GIS involve to Documentation,
   Information and Management Systems (DiMAS). Nowadays, there are good
   solutions for each one of them, but their integration poses still some
   non-trivial challenges. Between others, these challenges involve to a)
   interoperability between different tools, b) customized provision of
   services, and c) interactive dialogue with changing environments for
   different kinds of agents. In this work we describe our work in progress
   for the three mentioned issues which is being applied to Cultural
   Heritage Urban environments. The GIRAPIM solution developed in this work
   uses CityGML as a general semantic framework for integrating the above
   cited three systems, and displays some applications for interventions in
   public buildings and small urban districts with interest from the
   Cultural Heritage viewpoint. Some specific contributions of our approach
   concern to range-based modeling, the development of a specific Ontology
   common to DiMAS and the provision of web services along the life-cycle
   of intervention on the building or a small urban environment. The
   methodology is being applied for surveying interventions in isolated
   historic building and small urban district in several Spanish urban
   cities with interest from the Cultural Heritage viewpoint.},

Abstract = {Masonry Unit Database (MUD) is an integral part of Building Information
   Modeling for Masonry (BIM-M) initiative. MUD provides a data structure
   framework for storing the required data for digital representation of
   masonry units. Specific information about masonry units such as price,
   geometry and physical properties is needed throughout the lifecycle of a
   building project, including the design, construction, maintenance, and
   demolition stages. The development of MUD contributes to enhancement of
   masonry BIM tools for practitioners to incorporate up-to-date masonry
   product information into their projects. There are five main stages in
   the development of MUD: development of process map of masonry building
   project lifecycle, data requirement identification, physical design of
   database, design of data import structures, and finally design of data
   export structures. This paper focuses on the development of the SQL
   based MUD, and a Revit-Dynamo data export plugin for this database. The
   developed plugin is especially beneficial as it provides a tool for fast
   and accurate generation of the parametric and data enhanced masonry
   units as Revit families on the fly from the stored dimensions and
   attributes in the database. The generated masonry units with this method
   would be embedded in masonry wall systems in BIM building project.},

Abstract = {Predictive analytics, or the use of electronic algorithms to forecast
   future events in real time, makes it possible to harness the power of

   implementing predictive analytics in health care settings and make broad
   recommendations for overcoming challenges raised in the four phases of
   the life cycle of a predictive analytics model: acquiring data to build
   the model, building and validating it, testing it in real-world
   settings, and disseminating and using it more broadly. For instance, we
   recommend that model developers implement governance structures that
   include patients and other stakeholders starting in the earliest phases
   of development. In addition, developers should be allowed to use already
   collected patient data without explicit consent, provided that they
   comply with federal regulations regarding research on human subjects and

Abstract = {Numerous researchers have investigated various aspects of building
   information modeling (BIM), uncovering many important issues in its
   development and application. However, there has been inadequate
   investigation of the value to be gained from the integration of BIM in
   the facilities management (FM) phase of a building's lifecycle, despite
   its considerable potential. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
   value inherent in the deployment of BIM in FM. It identifies key FM
   operations that lend themselves to BIM, reviews the enabling
   technologies, and explores the potential value of BIM/FM integration to
   the building owner's organization. The associated challenges are also
   explored. Three case studies of university FM departments and their
   applications of BIM within FM practice are used to illustrate the key
   issues and highlight important considerations. Salient aspects of BIM/FM
   integration and the concomitant effects on productivity, performance,
   workforce engagement, business processes, economic efficiency, and
   organizational culture, are also discussed. The paper concludes that
   strategic BIM deployment in FM is critical to realizing the full
   potential of BIM use in a building's lifecycle. It is also considered
   vital in demonstrating the business value of BIM in facility operations
   and management.},
