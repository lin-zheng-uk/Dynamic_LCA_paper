Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is relatively slow in China in the
   early 21st century, and its practical application was only used in one
   stage of a project. Accordingly, the specific application of BIM in each
   stage was analyzed based on the advantages and values of BIM, and then
   the BIM framework was established in the whole life cycle of
   construction projects. According to the situation of BIM in China and
   the successful experience of BIM development in other countries, the
   problems of BIM application in China were identified, and corresponding
   measures were put forward to ensure better implementation of BIM in the
   whole life cycle. This study would provide reference for promoting the
   application of BIM in the whole life cycle of construction projects in
   China.},

Title = {Development of a Framework to Support Whole-Life-Cycle Net-Zero-Carbon
   Buildings through Integration of Building Information Modelling and

Abstract = {Decision-making on whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon buildings is
   critical for addressing carbon emission and environmental problems.
   However, there is a lack of a data integration framework and an open
   international standard approach integrating key decision variables to
   support scientific computations and decision-making for whole-life-cycle
   net-zero-carbon buildings. Building information modelling (BIM) is an
   open international standard representing building information. Digital
   Twin (DT) can capture and monitor real-time building conditions to
   facilitate building operation. Integrating information acquired by DT
   with BIM has considerable potential to enable an open international
   standard based computational representation of key decision variables
   throughout the whole-building life cycle process. This paper aims to
   develop a novel conceptual framework that integrates BIM and DT to
   support net-zero-carbon buildings. The framework is developed using an
   open international standard approach and the ontology-based
   representation method, to define key decision variables using entities,
   properties, and relationships, and integrates captured data via DT. The
   research makes significant contributions to enable net-zero-carbon
   buildings and paves the way for future research on an automated system
   to support decision-making for the whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon
   buildings.},

Abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and overall scheme for
   the use and management of building information modeling (BIM) in the
   whole building life cycle, especially the use of BIM technology for
   asset management and facility management. However, there is little
   understanding and implementation of enterprise BIM. BIM influences and
   changes the new project management mode of the whole life cycle of
   construction projects from design to construction. The safety, audit,
   responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in
   current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value
   management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive
   to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of
   new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the
   development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction
   projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain
   technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and
   traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party
   collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of
   building information, responsibility traceability and customer
   satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation
   ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the
   aspects of design technology, construction management, material
   scheduling and whole life cycle construction. This paper will provide
   some new ideas for the whole life cycle collaborative management of

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM), as an effective digital method of
   information representation in the field of construction engineering,
   helps to deal with a series of works including design optimization,
   construction planning, and facility management. BIM enhances
   sustainability through energy simulations, material selection, waste
   reduction, and energy monitoring. However, challenges like talent
   shortage, interoperability issues, data management, and lack of
   standardization hinder its widespread use. Current research lacks
   systematic exploration of BIM's application in green buildings' life
   cycle, limiting further development. To fill this research gap, this
   study aims to provide a systematic review of the application of BIM in
   the design, construction and operation stages of the whole life cycle of
   green buildings. As a guideline to conduct this research, the preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model
   are used to identify the main procedures for literature screening and
   review. Through the systematic review, the main applications of BIM
   technology in green buildings are summarized, while the challenges in
   the current applications and the corresponding solutions are discussed.
   Finally, the study proposes key points for the future development of BIM
   to help the construction industry truly realize the development of man
   and nature and harmony and greenery.},

Abstract = {Whole Building Life-Cycle Assessment is a methodology whose importance
   has been steadily growing in the construction industry, as a reliable
   way to assess the environmental impacts of a building through its whole
   life-cycle. Life-Cycle Assessment is used by designers, architects,
   manufacturers, and consultants for various purposes: eco-design, the
   achievement of Green Building certifications, including DGNB DK, and
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). This paper will examine the
   current advantages and challenges of performing Life-Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Life-Cycle Costing (LCC) calculations in the building sector
   based on the results of 41 survey responses and 110 interviews conducted
   between 2016 and 2017. The survey indicated that 86.5\% of respondents
   believe that the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in
   the automation of Life-Cycle Assessment calculations will allow LCA to
   be used effectively during the building design process. Also, according
   to our interviewees, the integration of LCA and LCC is a considered
   valuable approach for building sustainability but it is mainly driven by
   green building certifications. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Title = {A BIM-LCA Approach for Estimating the Greenhouse Gas Emissions of
   Large-Scale Public Buildings: A Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Exiting green building assessment standards sometimes cannot work well
   for large-scale public buildings due to insufficient attention to the
   operation and maintenance stage. This paper combines the theory of life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and building information modeling (BIM)
   technology, thereby proposing a green building assessment method by
   calculating the greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) of buildings from cradle
   to grave. Life cycle GGE (LCGGE) can be divided into three parts,
   including the materialization stage, the operation and maintenance
   stage, and the demolition stage. Two pieces of BIM software (Revit and
   Designbuilder) are applied in this study. A museum in Guangdong, China,
   with a hot summer and warm winter is selected for a case study. The
   results show that BIM can provide a rich source of needed engineering
   information for LCA. In addition, the operation and maintenance stage
   plays the most important role in the GGE reduction of a building
   throughout the whole life cycle. This research contributes to the
   knowledge body concerning green buildings and sustainable construction.
   It helps to achieve the reduction of GGE over the whole life cycle of a
   building. This is pertinent to contractors, homebuyers, and governments
   who are constantly seeking ways to achieve a low-carbon economy.},

Abstract = {Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) plays an essential role in the economic
   sustainability assessment of buildings, and building information
   modeling (BIM) offers a potentially valuable approach to fulfilling its
   requirement. However, the state of LCCA based on BIM is unclear despite
   previously published works. Therefore, this paper aims to address this
   gap by reviewing 45 relevant peer-reviewed articles through a systematic
   literature search, selection, and assessment. The results show that
   three data exchange methods integrate BIM and LCCA through data input,
   calculation, and output. Precision management, optimization measures,
   and parameter analysis through BIM significantly improve the value of
   buildings. Also, a methodological framework is summarized that combines
   LCC with other indicators based on BIM to consider eco-nomic,
   environmental, and social impacts, which can be monetized to assess life
   cycle sustainability costs. These findings provide insights for scholars
   and practitioners.},

Title = {Whole life cycle environmental impact assessment of buildings:
   Developing software tool and database support for the EU framework
   Level(s)},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {188},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The European Commission has published a framework on the environmental
   sustainability of buildings, called Level(s), a set of indicators
   addressing the resource efficiency and environmental impact of
   buildings. This framework is now a key element of European initiatives
   to develop a circular economy and aims to address whole life cycle
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to drive a renovation wave for
   existing buildings. Analysis of the whole life cycle environmental
   impact of buildings, with an emphasis on GHG emissions, is also the
   focus of initiatives in several EU Member States. To support users,
   Level(s) was accompanied by a list of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   software tools and databases for calculating such indicators. A need was
   identified for prac-tical, user-orientated information about the scope,
   consistency, cost, and accessibility of LCA software tools and
   databases. Therefore, a list of LCA tools and databases used in Europe
   for the assessment of the whole life cycle environmental impacts of
   buildings was compiled in 2017-2020 and their characteristics analysed
   based on a set of criteria. This paper describes the policy context of
   Level(s) and discusses criteria that can be used for the
   characterisation of LCA software tools and databases from the list
   compiled for Level(s). The methods included a literature review,
   surveys/interviews, and the co-creation of criteria for the
   categorization of tools and databases. The results are criteria
   including construction-specificity, system boundaries \& scope,
   indicators, modelling granularity, methodological adherence to Level(s)
   and EN standards, data quality, transparency and verification,
   accessibility, data exchange and interoperability, cost, training and
   support, as well as additional information. By providing greater
   visibility regarding the features of tools and databases, this paper
   contributes to the main-stream use of Level(s) and also to the
   implementation of key EU policy initiatives aimed at enhancing the
   environmental sustainability of the built environment, such as the EU
   Renovation Wave, the New European Bauhaus, and the EU taxonomy for
   sustainable activities.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic mapping (SM) study with the aim to
   determine how Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodologies and
   technologies contribute to energy-related analyses over the course of
   the entire building life cycle. The method adopted in the study is based
   on a set of seven research questions. We used a mixed technique
   combining co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling in order to
   analyze the publications' datasets for the period 2010-2020. The main
   advantage and novelty of this study are that the joint dataset from the
   Scopus and Web of Science databases was used to develop the keyword map.
   The main findings of this study indicate that many BIM-based
   applications can be used to analyze the building energy performance at
   all stages of the building life cycle. However, the applications of BIM
   in conjunction with other information technologies are limited and are
   still in the initial stage. In the future, the main improvements should
   be focused on process, model, system, tool, use and information
   modeling. The most promising long-term solution is an open BIM framework
   based on open standards, which allows the integration of BIM and energy
   simulation tools and satisfies specific data exchange requirements.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Global and governmental pressures have been acting as motivators towards
   delivering sustainable and low carbon buildings. One of the main sources
   responsible for carbon in buildings is embodied carbon that depends on
   material choices. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology developed
   to assess the materials, using embodied factors throughout the whole
   life cycle of the material. Although there are promising possibilities
   for incorporating LCA with building information modelling platforms,
   dynamic, early design assessment and automated integration still
   lacking. This paper proposes a novel framework and tool for automating
   embodied carbon calculations within the BIM environment. The approach
   leverages literature reviews and hands-on exploration to establish the
   foundation of a BIM-integrated LCA tool. The proposed tool aims to
   provide vital information for informed decision-making, minimizing
   errors, and facilitating low carbon building design. Ultimately, this
   framework could enhance early decision making, reduce error, time,
   effort and accelerate iterative design assessment.},

Abstract = {The integration of building information model (BIM) with point cloud
   from 3-D laser scanner provides powerful assistance in a variety of
   applications in the life cycle of building. However, the adoption of BIM
   and 3-D laser scanning for applications in the whole life cycle of
   buildings has yet to be satisfactorily reviewed. There is a need to
   understand the current situation of applications with BIM and 3-D laser
   scanning and their combined methods. The authors summarized combined
   methods of BIM and 3-D laser scanning at first. Then. the work presented
   in this article provides summarization of applications in the life cycle
   of building. In addition, the impact of emerging technologies on
   applications also be discussed. In this review, articles were limited to
   those published over the last decade. Two patterns in the approach to
   integrate BIM and 3-D laser scanning are reviewed. Several domains of
   application namely construction progress tracking, building components
   quality control, construction site safety, structural health monitoring,
   rescue after the disaster, energy modeling and management and modeling
   for exist building are looked back. According to occurred time of these
   applications, this article divides them into two classes: applications
   in construction period and applications in maintenance period. Based on
   the observed limitations in the reviewed papers, the authors conclude
   some potential future research trend for these applications based
   emerging technology at the same time.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment in the building design process - A systematic
   literature review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings contribute a significant portion of global greenhouse gas
   emissions and have the potential for large-scale impact reductions.
   Reducing the whole-life impacts of buildings is critical for creating a
   net-zero carbon built environment. For this to be achieved, the
   whole-life carbon impacts of design decisions must be considered during
   the building design process. A systematic review of academic literature
   was conducted to assess how life cycle assessment (LCA) is incorporated
   at various stages of the building design process, and what improvements
   are needed to support net-zero carbon design. The review compiled 274
   papers that were published up to the end of 2019, of which 108 were
   subject to detailed review following screening. The review found that
   LCA is generally used late in the design process, when it is too late to
   greatly influence the design. Incorporating LCA with either building
   information modelling or life cycle costing is seen to have the same
   challenges as undertaking a traditional LCA. Parametric methods show
   promise for design development, but tools and algorithms require further
   verification and regionalisation to be implemented throughout industry.
   The use of benchmarks, target values and other pre-populated information
   can be used to incorporate life-cycle thinking without the need to
   undertake a detailed LCA. The review has demonstrated that LCA continues
   to face barriers, in both methods and practice, preventing its ability
   to guide early-stage design decisions and have a large impact on the
   environmental performance of buildings.},

Pages = {202-222},
Abstract = {Building information Modeling (BIM) has been applied to the whole life
   cycle planning of construction projects, becoming the latest
   ``engineering brain{''}. Currently, researches on BIM involve various
   stages, but most of the review fields are relatively single and lack of
   systematic review and analysis. In order to comprehensively analyze the
   research trend of BIM in the field of engineering management, this paper
   takes the holistic analysis method as the framework. In the first stage,
   2066 research projects were quantitatively analyzed by bibliometrics to
   clarify their research environment. In the second stage, scientometric
   analysis method is adopted to identify scholars, countries, key words
   and journal sources that have achieved fruitful results and influence in
   BIM research, and to clarify the research environment. In the last
   stage, in-depth qualitative discussion is carried out to achieve three
   objectives: (1) to divide the whole life cycle of the article and
   summarize the research hotspots in each stage; (2) identify BIM
   application problems; (3) determine the future research direction. This
   work is helpful for researchers and practitioners in this field to
   quickly find influential and fruitful research or journals, and to
   understand the current research hot spots and trends for the next
   research planning.},

Title = {The BIM-Based multi-optimization approach in order to determine the
   trade-off between embodied and operation energy focused on renewable
   energy use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the building industry tends to produce energy-efficient
   buildings, which account for a greater percentage of embodied energy
   over their life cycle. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used as a method
   to assess the environmental impact of a building during its lifetime,
   and Building Information Modeling (BIM) includes the analysis of the
   building's environmental performance. It is necessary to provide a
   framework to optimize building Life cycle energy, taking into account
   different aspects of decision-making. The purpose of this research is to
   combine a multi-objective optimization algorithm with BIM and LCA to
   determine the trade-off between embodied and operation energy with a
   focus on renewable energy use. To achieve this objective, full LCA of
   exterior shell materials with the prefabricated focus was measured.
   Also, the amount of embodied energy and energy produced by the solar
   panel as a renewable energy production system was calculated in it. In
   the next step, parametric simulation in Grasshopper was done for
   operation energy estimation, and Hypervolume Estimation Algorithm for
   Multi-objective Optimization (HypE) was used. Then, to retrieve the data
   quickly, all the optimal solutions were added to the BIM model with a
   plugin. The results not only show that there has been an optimal range
   with maximizing embodied energy to reduce the operation energy, which
   can be extracted by the proposed framework. But also it represents a
   reduction of about 65\% in the whole life cycle energy of the building
   compared to the usual state of the construction industry in Iran. (C)

Abstract = {Innovative digital twins (DTs) that allow engineers to visualise, share
   information, and monitor the condition during operation is necessary to
   optimise railway construction and maintenance. Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) is an approach for creating and managing an inventive 3D
   model simulating digital information that is useful to project
   management, monitoring and operation of a specific asset during the
   whole life cycle assessment (LCA). BIM application can help to provide
   an efficient cost management and time schedule and reduce the project
   delivery time throughout the whole life cycle of the project. In this
   study, an innovative DT has been developed using BIM integration through
   a life cycle analysis. Minnamurra Railway Bridge (MRB), Australia, has
   been chosen as a real-world use case to demonstrate the extended
   application of BIM (i.e., the DT) to enhance the operation, maintenance
   and asset management to improve the sustainability and resilience of the
   railway bridge. Moreover, the DT has been exploited to determine GHG
   emissions and cost consumption through the integration of BIM. This
   study demonstrates the feasibility of DT technology for railway
   maintenance and resilience optimisation. It also generates a virtual
   collaboration for co-simulations and co-creation of values across
   stakeholders participating in construction, operation and maintenance,
   and enhancing a reduction in costs and GHG emission.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling begins to be perceived as the concept of
   ``covering all stages of the life cycle of a building{''}. A major flaw
   in this view is the fact that BIM is not actually perceived by all
   stakeholders as identical, and there is no single vocabulary, either in
   the form of a structured lexicon or in purely semantic understanding of
   many names and concepts used. Based on research findings BIM's focus on
   Building Information Management has proven to be a key part of BIM's
   success. As a result, it seeks to design a knowledge management system
   throughout the whole life cycle of the building as well as in the
   management of knowledge through partial projects. An essential part of
   BIM framework has identified the need to visualize knowledge and
   information. Based on other literature searches, ways of identifying
   knowledge, by deriving knowledge from information from experts, using
   shared models, are proposed. This derivation is directly driven by
   ontological identification and knowledge models based on taxonomy have
   been proposed. It leads to proposal of intelligent environment for team
   collaboration on projects or programs that probably require a suitable
   mix of different technology tools.},

   analyzing life cycle performances and feeding back to the design
   process. To support this, several methods and tools have been proposed
   that aim to obtain the life cycle performances of buildings following
   the level of model fidelity with the life cycle inventory (LCI) database
   at different scales. However, inconsistencies in decision-making caused
   by regional differences in LCA/LCC data sources, benchmarks, and
   building standards cannot be ignored. In this study, a scalable LCA/LCC
   method integrated with the BIM platform is proposed for the whole green
   building design process in the Chinese context, and it is implemented
   with a developed tool based on Revit. A national-/regional-specified
   database of building elements and materials is established. Referring to
   China's carbon-neutral target and relevant standards for green
   buildings, the baseline values are deduced, and a reference building is
   defined accordingly to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of the
   design scheme. According to the Assessment Standard for Green Building
   (GB50378-2019) and the survey of architectural design practices in
   China, the key parameters at different design stages are defined. The
   method and tool are demonstrated using the case study of a school
   building, analyzing its life cycle carbon emissions and life cycle costs
   throughout the design process. The results show that the proposed method
   can facilitate the improvement of the scheme at different design stages
   and that it can cope with different data accuracies and different LODs
   in the building information model in the Chinese green building design
   process. Lastly, the uncertainties raised by the data quality and
   time-associated factors are discussed.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling(BIM) is a building modeling technology
   based on the relevant information data of the construction project. It
   is an advanced technology and management concept, which is widely used
   in the whole life cycle process of planning, design, construction and
   operation. Based on BIM technology, transportation construction project
   collaborative management can have better communication through
   authenticity simulation and architectural visualization and can obtain
   the basic and real-time information such as project schedule,
   engineering quality, cost and environmental impact etc. The main
   services of highway construction management are integrated on the
   unified BIM platform for collaborative management to realize information
   intercommunication and exchange, to change the isolated situation of
   information in the past, and improve the level of information
   management. The final BIM model is integrated not only for the
   information management of project and the integration of preliminary
   documents and design drawings, but also for the automatic generation of
   completion data and final accounts, which covers the whole life cycle of
   traffic construction projects and lays a good foundation for smart

Abstract = {A building product proceeds throughout the whole life cycle in AEC
   industry. A great number of important information associated with the
   building is created, shared and integrated at each stage, and also
   changed with time, environment and human. Currently, severe problems
   like information loss of construction process, lack of integrated
   information environment, difficulty of information update, and weak
   learning capability in life cycle seriously affect information effective
   exchange, sharing and reuse, which result in low productivity in the
   industry. A building product lifecycle information model is the key to
   these problems. In an effort to address this issue, this paper
   illustrates building information classification and presents
   mathematical formulization of building product. A building life cycle
   dynamic information model based on influential factors of function,
   behavior, structure, environment, performance and human as core elements
   is proposed. Development of information model is object oriented
   methodology-based and supported by multiple layer-based modeling (MLM),
   layer connection object (LCO) and common feature abstraction according
   to the requirements of construction industry for information model.
   Finally, the model is implemented and validated through the case of a

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a convenient tool that is
   capable of collecting information throughout the whole life cycle of a
   building in one platform. The evolution in the digital BIM model in
   early design stages is not standardized, but Level of Development (LOD)
   is a concept that systematically structures the design processes divided
   into five levels. LOD is assessed in this paper as an opportunity to
   enhance the calculation of the environmental impacts in different early
   design stages more efficiently, using the methodology Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA). Enlightening the building elements that contribute to
   highest release of CO2, permits early building material selection. This
   facilitates a pathway towards sustainable and environmentally friendly
   buildings. This study evaluates BIM based LCA in early design stages
   (low LOD) through literature reviews and a case study. This papers' case
   study executes LCAs at different LOD levels using the LCA software One
   Click LCA (OCL). Assessments in LOD 200, LOD 300, LOD 350 and an
   additional LOD 350 were utilized. The additional LOD 350 was deployed
   when LCA experts had implemented changes within OCL. Moreover, a
   concretized suggestion where today's unpredictable development of BIM
   becomes part of a LOD framework is proposed.},

Abstract = {Whole Building life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations are increasingly
   done using building information modeling (BIM) data exports, but some
   challenges need to be overcome. BIM models lack data for a whole
   building LCA analysis. To counter this lack of detailed information,
   manual inputs are often required when using a static BIM model and
   cannot easily consider recalculations over the duration of the project.
   This paper presents a method to automatically perform LCA calculations
   early, at the first level of a BIM model's development (i.e. the LOD100
   level), and to allow for easier updates of the calculation throughout
   the evolution of the BIM model. To achieve this goal, a novel data layer
   and format is proposed. This data layer fills the information gap
   between extracted BIM data and existing LCA data provided by common LCA
   databases such as ecoinvent. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) has considerable potential for
   addressing sustainability issues in construction, but its benefits can
   be constrained by the failure to adopt BIM across the full project life
   cycle. Systematic whole-of-life BIM adoption can be supported by
   maturity models, but most models are limited by a lack of theoretical
   grounding, socio-technical dichotomies and the failure to adequately
   consider the full asset life cycle, often by overlooking the operations
   phase. This study aims to (1) develop a BIM maturity model that
   addresses these limitations by (2) using an in-depth analysis of an
   early adopter case study, thus addressing the lack of empirical research
   in BIM adoption experiences. A single interpretive research study was
   conducted to qualitatively analyse a US-based university. The data were
   gathered through interviews, field visits and document analysis.
   Actor-network theory (ANT) concepts scaffolded the analytical approach.
   The findings show that a complex BIM socio-technical network emerged,
   developed and converged during the project management stage but
   struggled to achieve durability as an ongoing solution to facilities
   management. By analysing the elements of success and failure across each
   stage, the researchers distilled five key lessons to achieve
   whole-of-life BIM maturity and proposed a life cycle BIM maturity model
   (LCBMM) supported by a practice guide.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an innovative approach based on a
   virtual model, which allows to manage all the information about the
   building. This approach is applicable to all the phases of the building
   process, but many surveys show the lack of BIM implementation in the use
   e maintenance phases. The BIM use in the management phase represents a
   unexpressed potentiality, a differentiating factor compared to Product
   Lifecycle Management (PLM), a holistic approach able to oversee the
   whole life cycle of a product and the information connected with it,
   widespread and consolidated in the manufacturing sector. Starting from
   this assumptions, in an empirical study, the paper presents a
   qualitative investigation into the current situation of the processes
   management of the constructed heritage in a French real estate company.
   The case study proposes the integration of the PLM and BIM approaches,
   that could be defined as Building Lifecycle Management (BLM), in order
   to close the gap of the traditional method.},

Title = {Is energy-efficient building sustainable? A case study on individual
   housing in Canada under BCESC energy updates},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {239},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Life cycle thinking and holistic sustainability assessment are missing
   in current building energy codes globally, with primarily focus on
   operational energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The overall
   objective and originality of this study is to evaluate the
   building-level life-cycle environmental and economic impact of building
   energy code compliance, exploring the trade-offs between energy savings,
   various environmental im-pacts and cost effectiveness, taking the
   British Columbia Energy STEP Code (BCESC) as a case study. An
   inte-grated approach of using building information modeling (BIM) with
   whole building life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC)
   is proposed, and comparisons of life cycle environmental and economic
   impacts are studied with respect to each energy upgrade level. The
   findings revealed that while the total energy demand intensity and GHG
   emissions decreased (by about 50\% compared to base scenario) with the
   code intervention steps, the other environmental impacts may increase
   due to the embodied materials, production, and upkeep of the upgrades,
   for example, the ozone depletion potential increased by nearly 800\%
   compared to the baseline. Additionally, the energy-saving measures
   reduce building operating costs by about C\$4,000, which is
   signifi-cantly less than the increased costs in other stages. However,
   this incremental cost does not always mitigate the effects of specific
   environmental impact categories. The findings will be of interest to
   building industry poli-cymakers to develop more holistically sustainable
   building energy policies, allocating limited funds in a more
   cost-effective manner to reduce environmental impacts, instead of
   focusing solely on direct and temporary benefits.},

Title = {Development of a life cycle net zero carbon compact house concept},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {12987-13013},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The paper presents the development process of an innovative,
   prefabricated compact house, which aims at creating a net zero
   greenhouse gas emission building design over the whole life cycle.
   Building Information Modelling helped to quantify the required building
   materials. Dynamic building simulations were performed in DesignBuilder
   to calculate the energy demand of the building for the operational
   period. To evaluate the financial feasibility and the carbon balance of
   the building, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were used. A
   heat and moisture transfer simulation was carried out to provide a more
   accurate analysis and to identify possible moisture problems.The
   assessment showed that the ratio of embodied impacts and operational
   impacts is typically 1:2 for wooden buildings and 1:1.5 for brick
   buildings. Life cycle carbon neutrality could be achieved in both cases
   with additional photovoltaic panels installed on the roof. However, a
   major difference between timber and brick buildings is the time factor:
   while the initial emissions from the production of brick buildings are
   gradually offset with excess solar energy, timber buildings act as
   carbon storage with negative emissions over the study period and the
   carbon is only released at the eventual end -of-life stage. The
   necessary size of photovoltaics is largely influenced by the avoided
   grid impact: if dynamic decarbonization of the electricity mix is
   considered, the size of photovoltaics required is about 1.5 times larger
   to offset the environmental load of the construction due to the
   diminishing benefits.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Purpose This paper searches for integration methods proposed by
   different authors that assess the life cycle of a building using models
   of building information modeling (BIM) and it also compares and
   discusses them. Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature review
   (SLR) is selected as the main research method of the present paper,
   aiming to collect and critically analyze multiple research studies. This
   paper is not only limited to studies where the whole life cycle has been
   assessed but also includes other papers which only integrated BIM to
   analyze carbon footprint, embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) or energy
   consumption. Findings Taking into account the countries that have
   published articles about the subject, it is possible to deduce that it
   has been studied in all of the continents, except Africa. In comparison
   with other continents, Asia and Europe have developed more studies.
   Furthermore, 76\% of the 34 selected articles were published in journals
   and only 24\% in conferences proceedings, and the number of papers that
   relates life cycle assessment (LCA) methods using BIM has grown from
   2013 to 2015, proving that the current theme is relevant. Several
   aspects of this literature review show the need to develop automated
   processes for LCA of buildings during the project's development phase.
   There is already a tendency to compare LCA results for buildings applied
   to BIM models, contributing to decision-making related to alternate
   projects, selection of materials, suppliers and components from an
   environmental perspective. Originality/value In the current global
   scenario, it is the notorious negative impact on the environment over
   the years caused by the architecture, engineering and construction
   industry (AEC). The integration of BIM-LCA can reduce time and improve
   the application of environmental analysis. Moreover, the proper
   application of a LCA method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the
   project can be hindered due to lack of information in the database about
   the materials or due to failures in the interoperability between BIM
   software and the LCA tool.},

   building life-cycle: analysis and feasibility study in the UK},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 10},
Abstract = {Construction regulations ensure a base level of safety of built assets.
   Formal checking of built assets against regulations happens at defined
   points in their life-cycle, and often there is limited automation
   involved. The movement towards digitising and automation elements of
   physical site inspections paves the way towards a whole life-cycle
   approach for compliance checking. This paper explores whole life-cycle
   compliance checking. It does this by extending current checking
   processes which are common in the design and construction phases into
   the operational phase of the building life-cycle, proposing that the
   best way to achieve this is through automated/semi-automated data
   capture and analysis. To test the feasibility of this concept, this
   paper will review existing academic literature, analyse existing
   regulations and conduct proof of concept testing. This paper has found
   that the concept of whole-lifecycle compliance checking is becoming
   increasingly important to better monitor and assure high risks elements
   of the built environment. When applied to the operational phase, it,
   however, becomes impractical and expensive when relying on solely manual
   inspections. Furthermore, there is a significant quantity of viable use
   cases for this approach and that there are viable technologies to
   leverage them.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of China's construction industry and the
   acceleration of urbanization, large-scale public building projects are
   becoming increasingly important in urban development, and the risk
   management problems of them should be pay more attention to. Based on
   the integration of back propagation (BP) neural network and building
   information model (BIM) technology, this paper carries out the research
   on risk management process of the whole life cycle of large public
   buildings and identifies the risk factors of large public buildings from
   the application dimension and the management dimension. The risk
   management evaluation index system is constructed and identified, and
   assessment, early warning, prevention, and control of risk management
   are applied and analyzed throughout the process. The international large
   public sports center project is used as a case study to establish a BIM
   model, while the BP neural network risk management model is used for
   prediction and calculation. The results of this study show that, first,
   the maximum deviation rate of the output indicators of the BP neural
   network risk model is 3.57\% in the design period (B2) and the minimum
   deviation rate is 0.00\% in the commissioning period (B4), which
   verifies the reliability of the training results of the model. Second,
   the best effect of risk management in the whole life cycle of the
   building is in the investment period (B1) and the highest risk is in the
   construction period (B3). Last, this paper constructs a new risk
   management framework to realise the risk management of the whole cycle
   of construction projects from design to operation, which helps to
   improve the management level and risk response ability of construction
   projects and ensure the smooth and sustainable development of the whole
   life cycle of construction.},

Title = {State of the art in damage information modeling for RC bridges - A
   literature review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Germany, bridges have an average age of 40 years. A bridge consumes
   between 0.4\% and 2\% of its construction cost per year over its entire
   life cycle. This means that up to 80\% of the construction cost are
   additionally needed for operation, inspection, maintenance, and
   destruction. Current practices rely either on paper-based inspections or
   on abstract specialist software. Every application in the inspection and
   maintenance sector uses its own data model for structures, inspections,
   defects, and maintenance. Due to this, data and properties have to be
   transferred manually, otherwise a converter is necessary for every data
   exchange between two applications. To overcome this issue, an adequate
   model standard for inspections, damage, and maintenance is necessary.
   Modern 3D models may serve as a single source of truth, which has been
   suggested in the Building Information Modeling (BIM) concept. Further,
   these models offer a clear visualization of the built infrastructure,
   and improve not only the planning and construction phases, but also the
   operation phase of construction projects. BIM is established mostly in
   the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector to plan and
   construct new buildings. Currently, BIM does not cover the whole life
   cycle of a building, especially not inspection and maintenance. Creating
   damage models needs the building model first, because a defect is
   dependent on the building component, its properties and material. Hence,
   a building information model is necessary to obtain meaningful
   conclusions from damage information. This paper analyzes the
   requirements, which arise from practice, and the research that has been
   done in modeling damage and related information for bridges. With a look
   at damage categories and use cases related to inspection and
   maintenance, scientific literature is discussed and synthesized.
   Finally, research gaps and needs are identified and discussed.},

Abstract = {The assembly building M\&E (Monitoring and Evaluation) system is a vital
   part of the transformation of China's construction industry, featuring
   intelligent control, high efficiency, and high safety. The article
   provides a comprehensive review of research related to assembly M\&E
   systems from the perspective of the whole life cycle of assembly,
   containing 125 journal articles from 1993 to 2024. The article analyzes
   some policies with updated iterations in the United States, Japan,
   Germany, Denmark, France, and the European Union. The literature review
   and semi-structured interviews with experts identified significant
   constraints limiting the various stages of the entire life cycle of
   assembled MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) systems. The
   absence of uniform design standards, personnel collaboration,
   prefabricated component testing, transportation, information
   utilization, intelligent testing, and recycling of disassemblability
   that can occur in the entire life cycle of assembled MEP systems are
   summarized. Finally, the article suggests that assembly M\&E systems can
   be shared and marketed to improve the economic viability of assembly
   M\&E systems and their wide application in the areas of technology,

Title = {Integration of building information modeling and project management in

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has spread worldwide not only as a
   digital construction tool but as a management method and is expected to
   play an essential role in project management. Before further exploring
   the contribution of BIM capabilities to project management, it is
   necessary to understand the integration of BIM and project management
   throughout the project life cycle. This paper aims to comprehensively
   understand the research status by reviewing the integration of BIM and
   project management in the construction project life cycle. The analysis
   results show that although the number of articles in this field has
   increased rapidly in the past 11 years, their relationship with the
   project life cycle is still relatively weak. To this end, a BIM
   capabilities framework is proposed by summarising BIM capabilities for
   project management in the project life cycle. This study will facilitate
   construction project teams and stakeholders to continuously integrate
   BIM with project management throughout the project life cycle, thereby
   improving project management efficiency in construction projects.},

Title = {Current Status and Future Directions of Building Information Modeling
   for Low-Carbon Buildings},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the intensification of climate change, the
   development of low-carbon buildings (LCBs) has gained great momentum,
   and building information modeling (BIM) is perceived as the most
   promising path. However, systematic integration, review, and analysis of
   research in the field of BIM for LCBs has been lacking, which may hinder
   the potential of BIM in assisting the achievement of the goal of LCBs.
   Therefore, this study explores the current research status of BIM for
   LCBs and the directions for further investigation. A hybrid literature
   review method was utilized, which consisted of quantitative and
   qualitative analyses. Firstly, a quantitative bibliometric analysis was
   conducted on 158 studies searched from the Web of Science core
   collection. The most influential institutions, journals, studies, and
   keywords were identified. The most often used terms were BIM, life-cycle
   assessment (LCA), design, construction, digital technologies (DTs), life
   cycle, and integration. Secondly, a systematic qualitative analysis was
   conducted of 117 carefully selected studies to identify the research
   focus of different stages (e.g., design, construction, operation, and
   demolition) of BIM for LCBs. The results showed that studies pertaining
   to BIM for LCBs mostly took a whole life-cycle perspective, followed by
   a focus on the design stage, while the volumes of studies focusing on
   BIM for LCBs in the operation and demolition stages were relatively
   small. Currently, research focuses on how the latest methods and
   technologies can be utilized to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions
   over the life cycle of a building, e.g., BIM-LCA and BIM combined with
   DTs. Lastly, the challenges and prospects of integrating BIM with LCA
   and emerging DTs for LCBs are discussed in depth. Five topics, such as
   BIM-based interdisciplinary collaboration and improving and validating
   the BIM integrated sustainability calculation models, are proposed as
   future research trends. This study points out the current research
   hotspots and future research trends in the field and builds a solid
   starting point for scholars who want to devote themselves to this field.
   For practitioners in LCBs, the research findings could serve as a
   practical reference for better understanding the potential of BIM for
   LCBs so as to take full advantage of BIM to more effectively realize the
   goal of LCBs.},

Title = {Holistic life-cycle accounting of carbon emissions of prefabricated
   buildings using LCA and BIM},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated concrete building (PCB) can save resources, reduce
   construction, improve quality, and reduce pollution. Understanding PCB
   environmental benefits versus traditional buildings could reinforce
   relevant policies and adoption. This study aimed to develop a holistic
   life-cycle accounting system based on BIM technology to calculate carbon
   emissions of PCB accurately and efficiently, and verify the effects of
   energy saving and emission reduction. Existing international and
   national databanks allowed the compilation of carbon emission factors.
   Five representative residential PCB projects were enlisted to calculate
   carbon footprints in six individual life-cycle construction stages. In
   most stages, carbon emissions were reduced with an increasing
   prefabrication rate. In the operation and maintenance stage, carbon
   emissions accounted for approximately 91\% of the total, and the
   building materials production stage accounted for about 11\%. The
   ``negative carbon emission `` in the demolition and recycling stage was
   about-4\%. Carbon emissions of the remaining three stages were minimal
   at about < 2\%. This study established the whole life-cycle
   carbon-emission indices of residential prefabricated buildings, with
   average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 105.88
   kgCO(2)/(m(2).a), and computed values for individual building stages.
   For comparison, a completely cast-in-place building was studied, with
   average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 130.79
   kgCO(2)/(m(2).a), significantly higher than the PCB. The study
   contributed to knowledge by furnishing the holistic carbon footprint
   calculation method and establishing the empirical patterns and trends of
   carbon emissions of PCB. The findings could inform construction
   projects' carbon-emission control and achieve the construction
   industry's green and low-carbon goals. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   framework in order to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). An
   information flows matrix is developed through the investigation of the
   parameters responsible for the environmental impacts of buildings. Such
   information content is tested on a case study after implementing the
   proposed parameters into a BIM. The purpose is to verify that the
   identified parameters, implemented in the BIM environment, are
   sufficient to conduct the LCA. The results show that the proposed
   parameters could potentially improve the data reliability and
   consistency in the process of sharing information from the digital model
   to the LCA software. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {BIM today is much more than drafting in 3D only, and project
   participants are further challenging, what is the topic of both this
   paper, and further research. Knowledge of objects, their behaviour, and
   other characteristics has high impact on whole building life cycle.
   Other structured and unstructured knowledge is rightfully added (e.g.
   historically based experience, needs and requirements of users,
   investors, needs for project and objects revisions) Grasping of all
   attributes into system for collection, managing and time control of
   knowledge. Further important findings lie in the necessity of
   understanding how to manage knowledge needs with diverse and variable
   ways, when BIM maturity levels are advanced, as defined by Bew and
   Richards (2008). All decisions made would always rely on good, timely,
   and correct data. Usage of BIM models in terms of Building Information
   Management can support all decisions through data gathering, sharing,
   and using across all disciplines and all Life Cycle steps. It
   particularly significantly improves possibilities and level of life
   cycle costing. Experience and knowledge stored in data models of BIM,
   describing user requirements, best practices derived from other projects
   and/or research outputs will help to understand sustainability in its
   complexity and wholeness.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Digital tools based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) provide the
   potential to facilitate environmental performance assessments of
   buildings. Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity
   take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed
   recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA
   tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout
   the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model
   are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the
   design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes
   can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder
   materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the
   embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental
   assessment during the design process could be misleading and
   counterproductive. Finally, three alternatives to the established
   automatic quantity take-off are discussed for future developments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {A retrofit plan for improving the energy efficiency of an existing
   building can contribute to a sustainable built environment. This study
   presents a novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization,
   6D-Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Life Cycle Assessment to
   enhance existing buildings' energy efficiency through applying energy
   retrofit measures. This framework aims to (1) integrate life cycle cost,
   and environmental impacts analysis (2) identify energy-efficient
   alternatives for buildings' energy retrofit (3) make the decision-making
   process straightforward for decision-makers and investors (4) discover
   the primary energy efficiency agents that impose the most energy waste
   on existing buildings. This study contributes to the body of knowledge
   by applying effective retrofit measures and alternative material choice
   and empowers decision-making by analyzing life cycle cost and
   environmental impacts of building envelopes by combining mathematical
   optimization, BIM, and LCA. The BIM energy model compares the cooling
   and heating loads of the building's components before and after applying
   retrofitting measures. The results show that inefficient buildings'
   envelopes and evaporative coolers play a significant role in energy
   consumption. A developed mathematical optimization model estimates the
   economic benefits of energy efficiency upgrades to minimize the total
   life cycle cost of a building during its lifetime. Moreover, it provides
   an optimum energy retrofitting scenario that leads to reductions of
   24\%-58.2\% in energy consumption. In conclusion, the Life Cycle
   Assessment Comparison between the building before and after retrofitted
   measures demonstrates that over 45\% of global warming impacts could be
   reduced in the well-established building.},

Title = {BIM-based life cycle assessment and life cycle costing of an office
   building in Western Europe},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The main aim of this research is to enhance the integration of life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies with
   building information modelling (BIM), as existing approaches still have
   limitations (e. g. interoperability issues, non-editable databases). For
   that purpose, an automatic LCA/LCC analysis within a BIM-based
   environment is proposed. A BIM-based environmental and economic life
   cycle assessment (BIMEELCA) prototype tool was developed by the authors
   to improve the integration of BIM with LCA and LCC. Moreover, a pilot
   case study located in the Netherlands was used to validate the work
   developed in this research, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this
   approach for the construction industry. This study unveiled the
   potential of BIM-based simulations for the assessment of the
   environmental and economic impacts of buildings by integrating semantic
   information in the model. The work presented in this research is
   expected to contribute to the development of automatic sustainability
   simulations, creation of tailor-made BIM objects' libraries, and use of
   historical data contained within data-rich models for predictive
   analyses (i.e. analyses that identify the most suitable solutions based
   on the data from previous projects).},

   lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar
   performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during
   the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a
   tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to
   select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally
   lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry
   additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to
   support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology
   in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC
   capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and
   increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC
   indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is
   developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency
   factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist
   designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The
   LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance
   cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's
   useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The
   earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to
   consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the
   proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and
   validated on two design options. The application of the actual building
   project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second
   alternative by 4.6\%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by
   35.4\%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4\% within
   the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the
   building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means
   the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin,
   designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages
   and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in
   its life cycle according to the proposed indices.},

Abstract = {Integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) is
   important for assessing and balancing the economic and environmental
   impact of buildings, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers a
   potential way of doing this. However, despite an ample amount of
   published work about the integration of LCA and LCC using BIM, no
   thorough review of this has yet been conducted. This study, therefore,
   aims to address this gap by reviewing the relevant peer-reviewed papers
   involved. After summarizing the applications of LCA, LCC, and BIM, a
   four-step methodology framework is presented for the development of BIM
   integrated LCA and LCC: (1) defining the system boundary of LCA and LCC;
   (2) defining the basic parameters and inventory analysis; (3) obtaining
   the environmental impact and cost results; (4) analyzing and optimizing
   the results. The results identify three main approaches for BIM
   integrated LCA and LCC: (1) using existing BIM software to obtain bills
   of quantities and other data, (2) exporting data from BIM model to an
   external platform, and (3) including information within the BIM model.
   Additionally, applications in life cycle stages and possible future
   research directions are further discussed. The study provides insights
   for both industry practitioners and academic researchers. (C) 2020

Abstract = {The building sector has high environmental impacts such as significant
   energy consumption and waste generation, which demands the development
   of tools to assess and reduce the impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   enables the quantification of the environmental impacts but also faces
   difficulties of detailed information acquisition. The application of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers the possibility to simplify
   and optimize the LCA process on account of the abundant data stored in
   the 3D building model. Therefore, the BIM-LCA integration has a high
   potential. This paper aims to propose a holistic workflow framework of
   BIM and LCA based on the qualitative content analysis. The framework
   links four steps of the traditional LCA process, namely Goal and Scope,
   Life Cycle Inventory, Life Cycle Impact Assessment and Interpretations,
   with three components of the BIM process, namely Pre- BIM, Modelling and
   Collaborations, and Results Collection and Visualization, to streamline
   the BIM-LCA integration. Challenges and future research directions
   within the integration process are explored as well in this research.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to identify and evaluate the potential
   benefits of using BIM in architecture, engineering and construction
   (AEC) industry in Gaza Strip, Palestine. A questionnaire survey was
   utilized and distributed to 270 construction professionals. Data were
   analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The results revealed
   the forming of four components (i.e., four factor structures) of BIM
   benefits; those are: (i) life cycle cost control and environmental
   issues, (ii) effective construction process, (iii) design and quality
   improvement and (iv) decision-making support. The results show that the
   most important individual BIM benefits among the main four components
   are: improving management and operation of buildings, controlling the
   whole life cycle cost, reducing change orders, increasing coordination
   between contract parties, improving communication, improving safety,
   improving quality and improving decision-making process. Professionals
   and engineers are urged to utilize BIM in designing and constructing
   buildings and infrastructure projects in the Gaza Strip, in order to
   improve effectiveness, efficiency, productivity and quality of
   construction projects. This paper provides an insight into the benefits
   of using BIM in construction industry at the Gaza Strip. It contributes
   to the overall body of knowledge relevant to advocating the benefits of
   BIM among construction organizations in developing countries, where
   there are limited studies in this area.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Extending the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools
   into the operation and management phases of a building's life cycle is a
   significant advance in recent years. However, few studies have
   investigated or developed tools for the life-cycle management of
   durability performance of built structures leveraging BIM. This gap is
   partly due to (i) the lack of an accessible interface that connects BIM
   software with durability models of built structures, and (ii) no
   available durability models that are fundamental in nature and thus can
   integrate with other tools. To begin addressing this gap, this paper
   presents a framework that uses the Application Programming Interface
   (API) within BIM to integrate physics-based durability performance
   models, which extends the application of BIM into the post-construction
   phases by enabling more accurate predictions of life cycle performance.
   An application of the framework is presented for analysis and management
   of a reinforced concrete structure.},

Abstract = {The history of the application of life-cycle costing (LCC) began in the
   UK in the late 1950s and, until now, the state of its development as a
   concept is not clear. A literature review is presented that shows the
   changing approaches to LCC by drawing on four major academic journals
   and 45 peer-reviewed papers. The review verifies that there is a revival
   of interest in using LCC in tandem with other life-cycle methodologies
   for research on sustainable building. It also presents a set of methods
   that are applicable to model and estimate the life-cycle costs of
   `conventional' and `green' buildings with the objective of
   distinguishing them. Through the information gathered, it provides a
   centralized source of reference for the assumptions used in LCC
   calculations concerning some key input parameters. The finding shows an
   increasing trend of publications on the evaluation of economic options
   for green building designs and performance. The directions are clear
   that the concepts and methods have to evolve to a state where they will
   help to integrate and optimize economic, social and environmental
   considerations to deliver more sustainable built environments in the
   future.},

Abstract = {. In the fields of AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction), BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) is developing quickly. Integrating point
   clouds from 3-D laser scanners with BIM is a potent solution with a
   range of applications across the building life cycle. This is due to
   LiDAR technology, which has become a significant component in BIM,
   obtaining 3D point clouds - a geometric representation of 3D models that
   is semantically rich. It is essential to understand the current status
   of 3-D laser scanning and BIM applications as well as their integrated
   tactics. In this review paper, the first section of the study summarizes
   the different approaches on Scan to BIM technique. Then, a detailed
   explanation of the various methods of mapping the scanned data with BIM
   is given. Proceeded by summarizing the various applications throughout

   across Canadian climates: A BIM-based fuzzy approach},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {306},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The urgency of addressing building energy consumption's impact on
   climate change, particularly from fossil fuels, is of great
   significance. This study investigates the environmental and economic
   aspects of different climatic conditions in Canadian regions throughout
   a building's life cycle. Focusing on HVAC systems, choice between
   electricity, natural gas and solar sources. Using whole building life
   cycle assessments and energy simulations, the research examines 36
   scenarios, considering three popular HVAC systems with six weather
   conditions. To reduce uncertainties, the study employs BIM and
   fuzzy-based methods. The results identified consistent environmental
   impacts across scenarios, averaging 1.4 tonnes CO2eq/m2 in GHG, 1.74
   kg/m2 in PM2.5, and 3.61 kg/m2 in SO2 emissions for a typical net-zero
   energy building in Canada. Variations primarily result from operational,
   embodied, and transportation stages, rather than other life cycle
   stages. Colder climates, like central Canada, exhibit higher energy
   demands and increased global warming potential. Ground Source Heat Pump
   (GSHP has lower emissions despite higher upfront costs and is preferred
   when considering both environmental and economic factors. However, in
   mild climates like Vancouver, Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) is optimal.
   Photovoltaic panels enhance HVAC system feasibility across various
   options. The study provides insights for building industry stakeholders,
   including designers, owners, and policymakers.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the importance of exchanging relevant and reliable
   information in BIM (building information model) based software. The
   concept ``Life cycle Information Model{''} (LIM) is a framework for
   information relevant to specified phases of the building's life cycle,
   and is proposed in this paper. Software model objects / object libraries
   are proposed as the container for standardized professional information.
   Model objects with information are suggested to be named
   ``BIM-objects{''}. The AEC-industry should take the initiative for
   achieving a broad consensus about the selections of information that
   should be standardized in the BIM-objects. A ``BIM-object standard{''}
   can be based on the LIM framework. Content defined in BIM-objects can be
   included in development of IDM's (Information Delivery Manual) within
   different professional purposes. Correct use of BIM-objects during the
   building projects life cycle should be supported by BIM manuals.
   Improved exchange of information in BIM based software will support use
   of integrated design solutions, (IDS).},

   Construction Material Recycling},
Journal = {RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The recovery rate of construction materials is only 5\% in China, which
   will lead to environmental and economic problems. Researchers from other
   countries have recognized the potential of building information
   modelling (BIM) in optimizing construction material recycling. However,
   previous research did not take the whole life cycle into consideration
   and was not practical enough. In this research, a questionnaire was
   conducted to find out how construction waste is disposed of in
   construction projects. Then, the existing research results were analyzed
   to find out how to apply BIM in the whole-life-cycle disposal of
   construction materials. According to the results of the questionnaire,
   landfill is the most common way to dispose of construction materials in
   China; besides this, almost no construction projects use BIM in material
   recycling. Hence, a BIM-based dynamic recycling model is proposed.
   Information management of materials, demolition planning, and BIM were
   all combined in this model for the purpose of optimizing the application
   of BIM, thus developing a waste material disposal system to achieve
   higher recovery rates and sustainability. More positive measures should
   be taken to deal with the problem of construction waste; if not, more
   environmental and economic problems will follow.},

   in Building Information Modelling: From systematic literature review to
   a methodological approach},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {182},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The construction sector is a major producer of greenhouse gas and waste.
   Several studies reveal the close relationship between the design phase
   and the reduction of environmental impacts caused during the life cycle
   of buildings, along with better economic and social performance. In
   order to achieve increasingly eco-efficient buildings, Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is an objective method to assess and reduce the impact
   buildings exert on the environment. Nevertheless, current environmental
   challenges require comprehensive solutions for the integration of the
   three pillars of sustainability, for which Life Cycle Sustainability
   Assessment (LCSA) is recognised as an appropriate holistic concept. The
   present paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which aims
   to detect opportunities to integrate the LCSA into the building design
   process and in Building Information Modelling (BIM). The results show
   that the harmonisation of the three dimensions and the data requirements
   are main achievements. Based on results obtained, a methodological
   approach to help on the LCSA implementation in BIM is presented. This
   proposed LCSA-BIM approach is applied to the Spanish architect's
   workflow and design stages, to exemplify its purpose.},

Abstract = {Recently, the aging of buildings is accelerating around the world. In
   line with this, architectural structures constructed long time ago
   require life extension and ongoing management and protection for
   improvement, because they are too deteriorated. In particular, since
   structural safety inspection and analysis in building is very important,
   `DFS (Design For Safety)' system has been introduced and conducted at
   the national level in Korea for the whole building life cycle management
   system encompassing the entire design, work commencement, construction,
   and completion stages. However, we do not have a system ranging from
   repair and reinforcement work plans in doing safety design, structural
   inspection and analysis to ongoing safety inspection. Therefore, it is
   necessary to establish a system to produce and share integrated
   information and conduct a research to manage architectural structure
   across the whole life cycle. Accordingly, this study aims to propose
   BIM-based reverse engineering technology for generating a safety
   management model based on laser scanner, verify the investigation items
   to be utilized of the design when building safety, and seek ways to
   utilize them for safety design.},

Abstract = {Railway turnouts or so-called `switches and crossings' are complex
   systems by nature of design and construction. Railway turnouts are used
   to change direction of trains from one to another. They require
   high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid
   degradation and component failures that could result in train
   derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency
   and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing
   practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research
   establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle
   management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3) has integrated
   6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and
   Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D
   embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life
   cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to
   improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design,
   manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation,
   operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better
   project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of
   railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on
   economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among
   them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver
   its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical
   communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors,
   accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction
   duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency,
   supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher
   operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The
   results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor
   towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing
   stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of
   life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation
   among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management
   team. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the era of big data processing, the type and scale of human society
   data are increasing rapidly. Data processing gradually transformed from
   the traditional simple objects into a basic social resource. Along with
   the technology development of expansion and storage of massive complex
   data, manage building information has gradually become possible. For a
   long time, building life cycle assessment(BLCA) of energy consumption is
   an important issue in the field of sustainable development and green
   building. However, the BLCA is facing huge amounts of data processing,
   which makes the subject remained in theory. The emergence and
   development of big data technology and building information model (BIM)
   provide effective tool for building a full life cycle energy assessment.
   This paper summarized the features of building life cycle energy
   consumption(BLCEC) data, proposed the method of information exchange and
   integration management by BIM, and ultimately utilize cloud computing
   technology to achieve wide-area BLC energy data management. It provides
   a broader vision for future Big data application studies.},

   Assessment/Life Cycle Costing Tools for Infrastructure Projects within
   Construction 4.0: A Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Construction 4.0 is a platform that combines digital and physical
   technologies to enhance the design and construction of the built
   environment. Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM), a component of
   Construction 4.0 ` s digital technologies, streamlines construction
   processes and promotes collaboration among project stakeholders. In this
   study, a comprehensive literature review and bibliometric and content
   analysis are conducted on building information modeling (BIM), life
   cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle cost (LCC), BrIM, and Bridge LCA.
   This study investigates the potential integration of BrIM, LCA, and LCC
   as inputs for bridges' LCA to enhance decision making by providing
   designers with detailed and interactive cost and environmental
   information throughout an asset's lifecycle and explores the
   functionalities of Construction 4.0 and its potential influence on the
   economy and sustainability of bridge projects. The reviewed literature
   showed that the tools currently used to apply LCA and LCC methods for
   infrastructure assets lack the ability to identify possible integration
   with BrIM and hold limitations in their key functions for identifying
   the utmost features that need to be adopted in the creation of any tool
   to increase the general resilience of bridges and infrastructure.},

   for the Full Life Cycle of Buildings and Information System Design},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {With the continuous improvement in China's economy, the construction
   industry has developed and rampantly progressed. Besides the wastage of
   resources and energy, the development has caused serious pollution to
   the environment. This makes the construction industry a high
   energy-consuming and highly polluting industry. There is a pressing need
   to reduce the wastage of resources and to adequately manage consumption
   of energy throughout the life cycle of buildings. This paper explores an
   effective method of building life cycle energy management by
   appropriately utilizing information system and the emerging deep
   learning technology. To achieve energy saving in buildings, a feasible
   model is proposed for predicting, analyzing, and building energy
   consumption based on neural networks. By analyzing the massive data
   stored in the building information system, the operation of each
   subsystem in the building is guided and regulated to achieve energy
   deployment and build energy optimization. Focusing the key meters, the
   average generalization ability of the proposed model (R-Squared = 1.9,
   MSE = 1.02) is better than the other contemporarily used models,
   LightGBM, LSTM, and SVR. Moreover, the method can effectively predict
   the energy consumption of the whole life cycle of the building and has
   higher prediction accuracy. The method proposed has great significance
   in research related with improving building energy performance and
   designing decision support tool.},

Abstract = {The study outlines the state-of-art on interoperability between Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Performance Simulation (BPS).
   First, the paper organises the result of a Systematic Literature Review
   (SLR) on the topic into three main strategies to achieve
   interoperability: the scripting to automate the in-formation transfer
   between BIM and BPS environments, the pipelines supported by current
   practices, and the MVD and IFC schema extension approach. Software
   applications, types of files involved, building features, life cycle
   phases and model geometry considered by the literature along with
   reported interoperability issues, are also analysed. Secondly, an expert
   review of grey literature focusing on EU funded projects, guidelines,
   reports, best practices and key initiatives on the field of BIM to BPS
   interoperability is presented. The study wraps up by reporting on six
   major research trends identified by the review and highlighting future
   developments. The results of the review seem to indicate that effective
   interoperability can be achieved with the definition of a commonly
   accepted strategy, integrating shared guidelines for modelling, a better
   inclusion of energy evaluations through the whole life cycle of a
   building and the upgrade of software application for the accurate
   production of information with open format exchange files.},

Title = {Life Cycle Cost in Circular Economy of Buildings by Applying Building
   Information Modeling (BIM): A State of the Art},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The building industry is one of the largest consumers of materials
   resources and significant contributors to global waste. Applying core
   principles of circular economy (CE) could significantly help the
   environment by reducing waste and decreasing the life cycle cost of
   buildings. Several strategies to implement the concept of CE in
   buildings include design for deconstruction, adaptability, and
   flexibility. However, implementing these design strategies could face
   constraints. In this study, we identified 22 barriers related to the
   adoption of CE in buildings, as reported in the literature. We discussed
   the role of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in overcoming those
   barriers. This paper demonstrates how BIM can facilitate the
   implementation of CE principles while providing critical insights into
   the life cycle costs of circular buildings. We identified 14 ways to use
   BIM to foster the implementation of a circular economy approach. To
   achieve these objectives, we have undertaken a thorough review of recent
   publications that explore CE design strategies, Life Cycle Costing in
   the circular construction of buildings, and BIM developments in the
   building industry. This literature review is based on 88 articles
   covering BIM's role in enhancing the management of a building's
   end-of-life while reducing the life cycle cost in the circular
   construction of buildings.},

Abstract = {The design world of architects and engineers is changing. Costs arising
   during the whole life cycle of a building are being taken into account.
   Therefore, complex tools to support design decisions are coming up, and
   an increasing number of experts from a great variety of disciplines will
   have to cooperate in a more and more interrelated and sophisticated
   manner. Our hypothesis is, that an integrated framework based on the
   metaphor of a ``dynamic building{''} as component-based, spatial model
   will bridge between the information technical representation and the
   ``classical{''} building planning. All planning, cooperation, usage, and
   aging processes of the building life cycle will be reflected in such a
   ``virtual{''} dynamic building, for which we are developing an
   appropriate framework.},

Abstract = {The concept of sustainable building has been widespread in the
   construction industry to reduce the environmental impacts from
   buildings. Considering the whole life cycle of a building, design stage
   is crucial in deciding whether a project will be successful. Therefore,
   this study will propose a strategy which can optimize the building
   design schemes to improve their sustainability and save cost over their
   lifetime with help of the cooperation between building information
   modeling (BIM) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO).
   Case study proves that this strategy is effective and efficient, which
   can largely reduce the designers' workloads and improve the building
   performances.},

Title = {An open building information modelling based co-simulation architecture
   to model building energy and environmental life cycle assessment: A case
   study on two buildings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {183},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Given the complexity and interconnection of different aspects involved
   in building evaluation, one of the most relevant, and challenging,
   research topics is the integration of different domain models (such as
   thermal comfort, indoor environmental quality and occupant comfort) to
   effectively describe and inform improvement strategies for the behaviour
   and performance of a building and building stock. Currently, this
   problem is unsolved with only one study attempting to integrate building
   energy simulation and life cycle assessments (separately, both practices
   are utilised to facilitate the design and management of buildings,
   traditionally consultancies offer building energy simulation services -
   most commonly for regulatory purposes - and more recently life cycle
   impact assessments), whilst no work has attempted this integration in a
   dynamic manner. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic,
   open building information modelling based co-simulation architecture.
   This architecture is the first to tightly couple and integrate
   EnergyPlus and Brightway2, in a way that does not rely upon heuristics
   or simplified tools. Furthermore, it is the first building energy
   simulation and life cycle assess-ment co-simulation to enable
   time-differentiated (dynamic) results and the first to be enabled only
   by open technologies. The architecture has been validated against two
   case-study non-domestic buildings located in the United Kingdom and
   Luxembourg, demonstrating its applicability to the construction and
   operational life cycle phases of buildings. The work presented in this
   paper has shown how a time-differentiated co-simulation approach across
   energy and lifecycle domains enables a more holistic analysis of whole
   buildings with greater accuracy and granularity.},

Title = {Integrating BIM-Based LCA and Building Sustainability Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the increasing concerns about building environmental impacts,
   building information modelling (BIM) has been used to perform different
   kinds of sustainability analysis. Among the most popular are the life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and building sustainability assessment (BSA).
   However, the integration of BIM-based LCA in BSA methods has not been
   adequately explored yet. This study addresses the relation between LCA
   and BSA within the BIM context for the Portuguese context. By performing
   an LCA for a Portuguese case study, a set of sustainability criteria
   from SBTool were simultaneous assessed during the process. The
   possibility of integrating BIM-based LCA into BSA methods can include
   more life cycle stages in the sustainability assessment and allow for
   normalising and producing more comparable results. BIM automates and
   connects different stages of the design process and provides information
   for multi-disciplinary data storage. However, there are still some
   constraints, such as different BSA/LCA databases and the necessity to
   manually introduce the embodied life cycle impacts of building
   materials. The scope of the BSA analysis can be expanded by integrating
   a complete LCA and be fostered by the support of BIM, effectively
   improving building sustainability according to local standards.},

Title = {A BIM-Integrated Relational Database Management System for Evaluating

Journal = {ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {75-86},

Abstract = {Sustainable procurement is an important policy for mitigating
   environmental impacts attributing to construction projects. Life-cycle
   cost analysis (LCCA), which is an essential requirement in sustainable
   procurement, is a principal tool for evaluating the economic efficiency
   for the total life-cycle budget of a building project. LCCA is a complex
   and time-consuming process due to repetitive complicated calculations,
   which are based on various legal and regulatory requirements. It also
   requires a large amount of data from different sources throughout the
   project life cycle. For conventional data management systems, data are
   usually stored in the form of papers and are input into the systems
   manually. This results in data loss and inconsistent data, which
   subsequently contribute to inaccurate life-cycle costs (LCCs). Building
   information modeling (BIM) is a modern technology, which can potentially
   overcome the asperities of the conventional building LCCA. However,
   existing BIM tools cannot carry out building LCCA due to their limited
   capabilities. The relational database management system (RDBMS) can be
   integrated with BIM for organizing, storing, and exchanging LCCA data in
   a logical and systematic manner. In this paper, a BIM-integrated RDBMS
   is developed for compiling and organizing the required data and
   information from BIM models to compute building LCCs. The system
   integrates the BIM authoring program, the database management system,
   the spreadsheet system, and the visual programming interface. It is part
   of the BIM-database-integrated system for building LCCA using a
   multi-parametric model. It represents a new automated methodology for
   performing building LCCA, which can facilitate the implementation of
   sustainable procurement in building projects.},

Abstract = {Digital Revolution is one of the most up-to-date topics in the
   construction industry - and not even in that. According to the spreading
   of a new trend in Building Design, Construction and Facility Management
   - using of Building Information Modelling Technology and its Management,
   there are going to be many changes in the way to develop the design
   process and other phases of building life cycle. BIM Technology use is
   present in the whole life cycle of buildings and other constructions and
   is able to connect all participants of building process in effective
   way. BIM Technology as a new trend in building design reveals the need
   to set up effective processes, their parts, participants, their
   responsibilities, goals and the way to reach goals, etc. The main
   philosophy of BIM Technology's implementation into the design processes
   lies in the BIM Execution Plan. This Plan should be specified for
   specific activities in specific environment and for specific
   participants in the whole construction process. These processes should
   be well conceived and managed. That's way we can undoubtedly replace the
   ``M{''} in BIM (Modelling) by the ``M{''} as a Management. This paper
   contributes to the further thoughtful strategy for the specific process
   of the design - from the designer's point of view and implementation of
   BIM Technology into this process in order to make the design process
   more effective. There are identified possible barriers for this
   implementation, their main causes, proposal to remove these obstacles
   and outlined a possible process of effective design using BIM technology
   and its principles. It is important to realize, that the implementation
   of BIM Technology in the design process will lead to a better virtual
   reality of the building and thus its transformation into physical
   reality will lead to a better construction and allow for greater cost
   savings not only during construction phase, but also in other phases of
   the building life cycle, especially during its use.},

Title = {Development of a BIM -based Environmental and Economic Life Cycle
   Assessment tool},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {265},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Currently, the built environment is one of the sectors that contribute
   the most to environmental impacts worldwide. As a result, the
   construction industry is increasingly adopting technologies and
   methodologies that promote the development of sustainable constructions,
   i.e. constructions that have low environmental, economic, and social
   impacts. Focusing on the environmental and economic impact of the
   construction, this research integrates the building information
   modelling (BIM) technology with the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life
   cycle costing (LCC) methodologies for the environmental and economic
   assessment of buildings. Building on the BIM-LCA/LCC framework and on
   the information delivery manual (IDM) and model view definition (MVD)
   for the BIM-LCA/LCC analysis, a BIM-based Environmental and Economic
   Life Cycle Assessment (BIMEELCA) tool is developed by the authors and
   detailed in this article. The BIMEELCA tool is used to support the
   decision-making process during early phases of a project and verify the
   feasibility of conducting automatic BIM-based LCA and LCC analyses in
   high-rise projects. A 250 m high-rise apartment, hotel, and office
   building is used to validate the usefulness of the tool at the early
   design stage. This case study demonstrates the feasibility to perform an
   automatic LCA and LCC analysis at this design stage by inserting in the
   model semantic information from generic databases. In the end, the
   benefits and limitations of the BIMEELCA tool are discussed. This
   research is expected to contribute to the promotion of semantically rich
   BIM models and the development of tailor-made BIM objects' libraries
   specific to the needs of companies.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the environmental aspects and energy impacts of
   implementing a green roof system at the Hilton Watford hotel, utilizing
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) software (Revit) for 3D modeling and
   Insight for energy simulation. Following EN 15804:2012+A2:2019, the
   study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, focusing on
   embodied and operational carbon. Environmental Product Declarations
   (EPDs), Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) database, and the Royal
   Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) guideline inform embodied
   carbon calculations. Results show the green roof system releases
   263,839.56 kgCO(2)e as embodied carbon, while its sedum layer sequesters
   211,468.12 kgCO(2)e over a 50-year lifespan. Energy efficiency analysis
   indicates a 3.3 kWh/m(2)/yr reduction in energy consumption, leading to
   a 112,130.31 kgCO(2)e reduction in operational carbon emissions,
   highlighting the environmental benefits of green roof adoption. The
   findings suggest a 0.35\% mitigation of whole life cycle carbon
   emissions, with greater impact in situations of lower insulation
   effectiveness, showcasing the potential of green roofs in reducing
   carbon emissions. Additionally, the green roof incurs a minimal
   financial burden, constituting only 0.51\% of the overall project cost.},

Abstract = {The design and production of assembled buildings are difficult to
   standardise, which limits their extensive application. In this paper,
   the design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA) concept is applied to the
   design of vertical precast concrete (PC) components for assembled
   buildings. Taking vertical PC components as an example, the rapid
   modelling and whole life-cycle application of DFMA-oriented PC
   components for assembled buildings are investigated. Firstly, the
   modular design method is introduced. By combining parametric design and
   building information modelling (BIM), we propose a modular, parametric
   design method and process of PC components based on DFMA. Secondly, the
   design of standard modules after secondary splitting is introduced for a
   better DFMA-oriented parametric design of PC components. We explored the
   secondary development process of DFMA and BIM and the module creation
   process of the parametric standard based on family templates and DFMA.
   Thirdly, based on the parametric standard module, the application of the
   optimised whole life cycle of design, manufacture and assembly of PC
   components is introduced. Finally, the feasibility of this method is
   verified by practical cases. The design process for PC components is
   fast, accurate and standardised. The integrated application of BIM is
   accelerated, and digital collaboration in assembly construction is
   strengthened. The study results are conducive to establishing a
   standardised design and production system for PC components, reducing
   design costs, improving design efficiency and the comprehensive benefits
   of assembled buildings.},

Abstract = {In recent years Asian Nations showed concern over the Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) of their civil infrastructure. This study presents a
   contextual investigation of a residential apartment complex in the
   territory of the southern part of India. The LCA is performed through
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) software embedded with
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) of materials utilized in
   construction, transportation of materials and operational energy use
   throughout the building lifecycle. The results of the study illustrate
   that cement is the material that most contributes to carbon emissions
   among the other materials looked at in this study. The operational stage
   contributed the highest amount of carbon emissions. This study
   emphasizes variation in the LCA results based on the selection of a
   combination of definite software-database combinations and
   manual-database computations used. For this, three LCA databases were
   adopted (GaBi database and ecoinvent databases through One Click LCA
   software), and the ICE database was used for manual calculations. The
   ICE database showed realistic value comparing the GaBi and ecoinvent
   databases. The findings of this study are valuable for the policymakers
   and practitioners to accomplish optimization of Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
   emissions over the building life cycle.},

Abstract = {Buildings play a major role in increasing energy consumption and bulk
   atmospheric emissions. Energy analysis must be taken into consideration
   because of increased global warming. In the present scenario, Glazed
   walls with gas infills are preferred for their aesthetic appearance by
   AEC designers (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) in commercial
   buildings. The environmental impact must be considered in the selection
   of glazing panels and framing materials of a building. In this work, a
   fully glazed commercial building (FGCB) is chosen and modelled using
   Autodesk-Revit (BIM software) and then simulated using Green Building
   Studio Software. The life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) and life cycle
   cost analysis (LCCA) results are compared to come out with
   energy-efficient and cost-effective material. The optimized energy usage
   of Double low-E glazing and Double reverse glazing with glass infill
   were compared with the existing single clear glass for their performance
   over its entire life cycle based on both energy usage, cost, and
   greenhouse gas emission by analysing its embodied and operating energy.

Title = {Comparative BIM-based Life Cycle Assessment of Uruguayan timber and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The use of wood and engineered wood products is today considered an
   opportunity for the mitigation of negative building environmental
   impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions. However, the literature
   provides evidence that the quantification and generalization of the
   environmental benefits of wood during the whole building life cycle can
   be difficult. This paper presents a quantitative method based on Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare, during their design stages, the
   environmental impacts produced by a timber-frame single-family house
   versus those of a concrete-masonry-based house built in Uruguay. The
   method, conceived as a decision-oriented tool, integrates Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and LCA to quantify and compare the
   environmental impacts of one of the most common dwelling typologies in
   Uruguay. The results of the cradle-to-grave assessment show that the
   timber-frame building produced the lowest impacts in Global Warming
   Potential, Human Toxicity, Acidification Potential, Ozone Depletion
   Potential, and Freshwater Ecotoxicity, but yielded the highest impacts
   in Eutrophication Potential. The findings also show that the method
   developed herein facilitated the comparison and contrast between the
   pros and cons of both design options during their design stages. (C)

Abstract = {The need for embedding sustainability in construction development
   contributed to the introduction of Building information Modelling (BIM)
   to be adopted into the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) process. Through BIM,
   project information used during design can be shared to estimate the
   project's end of life costs. LCC enables to assess the overall cost of
   an asset (building) through its life cycle via functionalities including
   the original investment costs, maintenance expenses, operating expenses,
   and the remaining value of the asset at the end of its life. The
   objective of this paper is to discuss the merging of BIM into LCC
   through four prevalent aspects; methodology, design software used,
   benefits, and challenges. A total of 20 studies were reviewed upon
   filtering process using PRISMA method. These studies discussed at least
   one of the aspects mentioned and contributed to the information
   regarding BIM and LCC. This paper thus aims to expanding studies on BIM
   adoption on LCC through the collected information sourced from
   peer-reviewed publications.},

   Cycle Costs for an Open Building Design},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the long-term use of buildings, renovations are sometimes required as
   usage behaviors have changed and residents' demands for space are
   adjusted. However, the public in general are deficient in renovation
   knowledge and information regarding building use and its maintenance
   phases; thus, the initial stage of planning and design often lacks
   flexibility, leading to waste materials in the subsequent renovation
   project. Theoretically, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be used
   as a building unit resume and renovation benefit prediction tool;
   moreover, it plays an important role in the usage and maintenance
   phases. This study develops three design proposals that target different
   service lives (30 years, 50 years, 100 years), as based on the
   building's expected life, and uses BIM technology to simulate the life
   cycle cost and design performance, as based on the renovation scenario
   analysis of the building's life cycle. The findings show that under the
   service condition target of 100 years, when the open flexible technique
   is used for the design, space utilization flexibility is enhanced,
   pipeline maintenance is convenient, waste is reduced, and performance in
   life cycle cost is better. BIM can predict performance simply and
   rapidly according to future usage demand adjustments after the initial
   design.},

Title = {Drivers of BIM-Based Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Buildings:
   An Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) for life cycle sustainability
   assessment is an emerging development considered valuable given its
   importance in enhancing the environmentally friendly performance of
   buildings by delivering eco-efficient structures. However, despite its
   benefits, adoption is low. Thus, this study examines the key drivers of
   a building's BIM-based life cycle sustainability assessment. An
   interpretive structural modelling approach and Matrice d'Impacts
   croises-multipication applique a classement (MICMAC) analysis were
   adopted for this study. Nineteen key drivers were categorized into a
   seven-level ISM model, which revealed that the successful implementation
   of the driving factors for BIM-based LCSA would increase its adoption
   and encourage users to be proactive in exploring solutions, exerting
   best efforts, and advancing its usage. The primary drivers, such as
   organizational readiness, personal willingness to use, procurement
   methods, and organizational structure, amongst others, are crucial for
   discussing BIM-based LCSA adoption strategies and making guidelines and
   design decisions to guide the process. This paper therefore contributes
   to the growing discussion on BIM from the viewpoint of an assessment of
   a building's life cycle sustainability. The study concludes that
   organizational, governmental, and institutional support, as well as
   capacity development, are essential to driving BIM-Based LCSA.},

Abstract = {The value retention of real estate is increasingly ensured by the
   inclusion of sustainability aspects in the planning. As a result,
   life-cycle considerations of the future earnings situation of a property
   are already necessary in the project development phase. By comparing the
   revenues to the life cycle costs, the life cycle return (LCR), as it is
   called by the authors, can be determined as a prognostic parameter for
   assessing the profitability of an investment. In this paper, the project
   information available at an early stage is integrated into a digital
   building model to determine the LZR. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   can reduce the uncertainty of the cost calculation in an early project
   phase by linking the digital planning status with relevant building
   information. Based on a digital building model, it is thus possible to
   determine the LZR in a way that is comprehensible and adaptable to
   planning variants. The breakdown of all revenues and costs relevant for
   the life cycle is necessary for this. Changes and additions to the
   building model require a continuous and rapid adjustment of the
   calculations to the respective planning status. This makes it possible
   to continuously check the initial parameters defined at the beginning of
   the project.},

   life of buildings begin to decline from the day of official use until
   they are demolished and resulting in extremely high cumulative cost
   throughout the building life cycle (BLC). However, the development of
   building information modeling (BIM) provides a solution for short BLCs
   and massive cumulative cost caused by errors occurring during the
   building design and construction phases. BIM is an innovative technique
   applicable to building design and construction management that has been
   vigorously developed in the construction industry. The development of
   BIM technology is now a global trend that can not be ignored, similar to
   2D CAD before. BIM can be further developed into several aspects and
   applied during the construction phase, most important of all, enhance
   the overall building functionality and save operating cost throughout

Abstract = {The building physics research community is facing a challenge in
   evaluating the sustainability of modern buildings using digital tools
   and methods. Achieving carbon neutrality, the primary objective of the
   building industry, requires incorporating Industry 4.0 tools into
   current building evaluation procedures. To address this need, this
   research presents an Application Programming Interface (API) designed to
   facilitate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for entire buildings using
   information from Building Information Modelling (BIM) files. The study
   outlines the steps involved in developing a BIM-LCA API, including code
   development and validation with commercial software. The research
   identifies challenges in creating a uniform database platform for
   BIM-LCA, and the need for region-specific databases to provide automated
   material classification for measuring potential environmental
   consequences. The study also emphasizes the importance of establishing
   market-level sustainability standards through the development of
   relevant tools, training techniques, and procedures, and the need for
   national rating systems to align with these standards to achieve
   European climate adaptation and circularity goals. The assessment also
   identifies future challenges in the field and highlights the expected
   role of the European Union (EU) Level(s) sustainability scheme.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing realisation of the importance of operation and
   maintenance as opposed to capital costs throughout the life of an asset.
   In addition, new styles of contracts such as PFI (Private Finance
   Initiative) are becoming more popular. This will require that the
   building product is addressed within its holistic picture including the
   design, construction and maintenance. It is therefore vital to embed the
   life cycle costing element of a facility within its design and
   construction. Whole Life Costing is a technique used to facilitate
   effective choice between alternatives in the search of economic
   solutions. Information technology, particularly integrated databases and
   VR (Virtual Reality), can provide the mechanism to facilitate the
   integration of the whole life cost information.
   The research project described in this paper aims to add a life cycle
   costing element to the design phase of the OSCON integrated database
   developed at Salford University in the UK. The current integrated
   database within OSCON supports the functions of design, estimating and
   planning. The proposed system will allow the user within a VR
   environment to navigate inside the building retrieving information about
   building components that need replacement or repair. A colouring
   mechanism will be developed to show various elements in different
   colours according to cost criteria. This would allow the user to easily
   inspect the building and get rough ideas of repair and maintenance
   programmes, running costs and cash flows. The system will allow data to
   be updated continuously so that it will enable the comparison with
   initial plans and estimates and provides a fresh view of future action
   and feedback.},

Title = {BIM-VE-Based Optimization of Green Building Envelope from the
   Perspective of both Energy Saving and Life Cycle Cost},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the context of the increasingly severe energy crisis and global
   warming, green buildings and their energy-saving issues are being paid
   more attention in the world. Since envelope optimization can
   significantly reduce the energy consumption of green buildings, value
   engineering (VE) technology and building information modeling (BIM)
   technology are used to optimize the envelope of green buildings, which
   takes into account both energy saving and life cycle cost. The
   theoretical framework of optimization for green building envelope based
   on BIM-VE is proposed, including a BIM model for architecture, a life
   cycle cost analysis model, energy-saving analysis model, and a value
   analysis model. In the life-cycle cost model, a mathematical formula for
   the life-cycle cost is established, and BIM technology is used to
   generate a bill of quantity. In the energy-saving analysis model, a
   mathematical formula for energy saving is established, and BIM
   technology is used for the building energy simulation. In the scheme
   decision-making sub-model, VE technology integrating life cycle cost
   with energy saving is used to assess the envelope schemes and select the
   optimal one. A prefabricated project case is used to simulate and test
   the established methodology. The important results show that the 16
   envelope schemes make the 16 corresponding designed buildings meet the
   green building evaluation standards, and the optimal envelope scheme is
   the ``energy-saving and anti-theft door + exterior window 2+ floor 1+
   exterior wall 1 + inner shear wall + inner partition wall 2 + planted
   roof{''} with the value 10.80 x 10(-2) MW center dot h/ten thousand
   yuan. A significant finding is that the value generally rises with the
   increase of energy-saving rate while the life cycle cost is irregular
   with the increase of energy-saving rate. Compared with previous efforts
   in the literature, this study introduces VE technology into
   architectural design to further expand the current boundary of building
   energy-saving theory. The findings and suggestions will provide a
   valuable reference and guidance for the architectural design industry to
   optimize the envelope of green buildings from the perspective of both
   energy saving and life cycle cost.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of bridge construction, environmental
   concerns have become increasingly prominent. Low-carbon, green, and
   sustainable bridge engineering has emerged as an inevitable trend. A
   comprehensive carbon emission calculation system is key to achieving
   low-carbon bridges. This study proposes a rapid calculation and analysis
   system for bridge carbon emissions (Building Information Modeling-Life
   Cycle Assessment, BIM-LCA). This system, using the bridge information
   model as a carrier, calculates and manages data on material consumption,
   machinery, transportation, and energy throughout the bridge's life
   cycle. It then calculates the carbon emissions for each stage. This
   system simplifies the complex and cumbersome data collection and
   analysis processes found in traditional methods while also making the
   carbon emissions across the full bridge life cycle more accessible and
   visible. Being applicable to all types of bridges, this system can
   provide insights and a basis for decision-making in the early design
   stages and during construction and operation to support carbon
   reduction. Ultimately, it promotes low-carbon, environmentally friendly,
   and sustainable bridge engineering development.},

Abstract = {In this paper an insight on innovative implementation strategies and
   operative Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) regarding
   Intelligent Buildings (IBs) is provided. Data-driven knowledge
   extraction and re-usage can be a valid source of information to study
   the whole building life-cycle as a process to optimize. Today, new
   challenges can be provided thanks to ICT and Internet of Things (IoT)
   paradigms that allow big data to be stored, processed and analysed. This
   approach is still not deeply applied in construction engineering fields.
   In order to analyse the related literature, first a framework to
   describe the IB technological environment is proposed. Second, the
   literature is reviewed according to this framework and focusing on ICT
   tools and implementation aspects for the whole building life-cycle. To
   the best of our knowledge, there isn't yet a survey focusing on
   innovative operative tools adopted in the development of the ICT
   technological layer of IB. The reviewed literature is discussed by
   identifying implemented technologies and related ICT tools and
   classifying applications in building life-cycle. Finally, critical
   aspects are singled out and opportunities for future developments in the
   field of IBs are outlined.},

Abstract = {Numerous costs are associated with the design, construction,
   installation, operation, maintenance, and deconstruction of a building
   or building system. One of the challenges usually faced by an
   organization's capital planning department and/or facility management
   department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly
   estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the
   programming phase when no building design is available. To provide
   facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to
   assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are
   developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple
   building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to
   predict facilities' LCC-initial design and construction cost, utility
   cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors
   propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using
   data provided by building systems. The corresponding domain
   ontology-LCCA-Onto-is also presented. The proposed approach provides
   organizations who own multiple facilities with an innovative solution to
   the LCC prediction issue.},

Abstract = {A significant share of federal and regional infrastructure budgets is
   spent on constructing, maintaining, repairing, and replacing road
   infrastructure. Due to its magnitude, sustainable road construction
   practices can support national sustainable development goals (e.g. The
   Federal Sustainable Development Strategy of Canada). However, the quest
   for sustainable road construction practices has been hindered by the
   lack of expertise, information, and resources. The advent of building
   information modeling (BIM) provides more extensive access to functional
   and physical data of construction material. Published literature has
   overlooked BIM-based methods that facilitate the life cycle
   sustainability evaluation of road construction techniques. This paper
   presents a methodological framework for life cycle thinking-based road
   infrastructure evaluation. This framework compares the life cycle
   sustainability performance of alternative road pavement construction
   methods. A BIM-based visual program has been created to automate the
   proposed framework. The program was demonstrated by comparing three road
   construction methods for a collector road. Results indicated that
   geomembrane road is the best solution based on the triple bottom line of
   sustainability. The proposed Life cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA)
   framework, a BIM-based tool, and the implementation road map will assist
   infrastructure managers in selecting the most sustainable road
   construction method that will consequently support United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).},

Title = {Integration of Smart Cities and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for
   a Sustainability Oriented Business Model to Address Sustainable

Abstract = {The construction industry, business models, and smart cities are
   recognized as pivotal domains with profound implications for fostering
   sustainability, prompting extensive research endeavors. However, there
   remains a dearth of interdisciplinary integration within this sphere
   aimed at fostering sustainable development. Nevertheless, current
   studies suggest that research in this area could provide theoretical and
   practical guidance for the sustainable transformation of society and
   make a positive contribution to the realization of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, this paper aims to utilize an
   innovative mixed research approach combining macro-quantitative
   bibliometric analysis with subsequent micro-qualitative content
   examination based on the SDGs to explore the relationship between BIM
   and smart cities in promoting a sustainability-oriented business model,
   which provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall situation
   and development of research topics in the field and contributes to the
   improvement of the SDGs. The results show that, during the last 13 years
   (from the year 2011 to 2023), the period from the year 2011 to 2016 was
   the initial stage of the field, followed by a rapid growth after the
   year 2018, of which ``BIM{''}, ``Smart City{''}, ``Business Model{''},
   ``Building Life Cycle{''}, ``Urban Management{''}, and ``Business Model
   Innovation{''} are the keywords representing the current research
   hotspots. The circular economy model that has been developed since 2021
   has contributed to life cycle stages, including ``briefing stages{''}
   and ``procurement stages{''}. As such, the ``whole life cycle{''},
   ``strategic urban planning frameworks{''}, and ``sustainable business
   models{''} have become future research trends, whilst real-world
   applications such as ``smart tourism{''}, ``e-government{''}, and
   ``green building{''} have emerged. Further, the key partnerships of
   ``city managers{''}, ``corporate enterprises{''}, and ``public
   participation{''} for smart cities contribute to the achievement of SDGs
   8 and 17 in terms of integrating urban information technology and urban
   infrastructure, policy regulation, knowledge-sharing, improving economic
   efficiency, and promoting sustainable economic growth.},

   infrastructure) has not been improving as expected, while other
   industries have been able to improve their productivity significantly.
   The appropriate use of building information modelling (BIM) technologies
   brings several benefits and advantages to construction projects. The
   main challenges of project efficiency emerge in the form of numerous
   requests for information during the construction project, which are
   considered to be waste in the processes. This highlights the need for a
   practical process model to plan the information flow for BIM-based
   projects. The main aim of this study is to propose a model to plan the
   flow of project information among primary stakeholders especially in
   infrastructure projects. Our main findings are firstly, the foundation
   for data management starts from defining unified one data for the
   product and the for the process. Unified data means one single
   repository of data - all stakeholders use the same unified data. It is
   also essential that data responsibilities and ownership are defined.
   Secondly, we found that the biggest challenges are that the data needs
   are not planned beforehand, resistance to change, difficulty receiving
   existing data and data must be modified before use. As a whole, it seems
   sometimes that the technology on data transfer is more important that
   what has been transferred and why. Finally our construction, the life
   cycle model for data flow originates from one data to all stakeholders,
   single data repository must be updated along the lifecycle of the object
   covering also the operations and maintenance, where the data has to be
   updated through the whole life-cycle. This new approach is intended to
   enable the early involvement of maintenance stakeholders in designing
   product data for a project lifecycle perspective. The model helps to
   change the current information flow and gain the benefits that a
   BIM-based process can offer. This study is based on case studies and is
   qualitative in nature and naturally needs more validation.},

Abstract = {The building sector has seen recent growth in the number of published
   data of construction materials, which can help building practitioners
   prioritize products with lower environmental impacts. However, EPDs rely
   on varying assumptions within their life cycle assessment (LCA). This
   study aimed to evaluate the use of EPDs as a data source instead of a
   generic data source and its effect on the life cycle impacts of a
   multiresidential building. This study focused on 19 North American EPDs
   of structural wood products. The impact assessment results found in the
   EPDs were compared to the Ecoinvent V3.8 database. The findings of the
   present study suggest that EPDs can generally be used without
   distinction compared to the data in the Ecoinvent V3.8 database.
   However, a few data were found to be outliers. In addition, EPDs of
   structural wood products only disclosed its manufacturing stage. Other
   life cycle stages, such as transport of the construction product, can
   have a significant impact on the building's LCA. Therefore, using EPDs
   to assess building impacts is recommended over their direct comparison
   for practitioners to make more comprehensive decisions towards embodied
   impacts of buildings.},

Abstract = {In this research and innovation work, we propose an open and
   interoperable approach for exploiting the various building data
   collected across the different phases of a building's life cycle via a
   BIM-based Mixed Reality (MR) platform. Building information modelling
   (BIM) has gradually gained attention in recent decades and is widely
   considered a key to digitising and optimising the building life cycle.
   Yet, there are significant challenges in the standardization of
   methodologies, interoperability of solutions, and data exchange, as well
   as the usability of BIM-related solutions. Moreover, modern or renovated
   buildings produce extensive real-time data on top of the static data
   organised in BIM, and it is commonly accepted that most professionals in
   the field do not have access to the critical static or dynamic data that
   accompany a building project. Here, we exploit MR as an advanced user
   interface for enhanced interaction with building static and dynamic data
   instantiated by a BIM model, while we address a seamless conversion of
   BIM data to an online visual digital twin that supports the MR mobile
   application.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Buildings management along with its life cycle is currently an issue
   that requires a great optimisation considering the high cost associated
   with the buildings use and due to the operation and maintenance costs.
   The number of existing buildings needing refurbishment actions justify
   the need of an intervention model that optimise its service life after
   the refurbishment process. So, a refurbishment, maintenance and costs
   planning should be established and guided by value for money principles.
   The aim of this paper is to analyse the application of Buildings Life
   Cycle Management (BLCM) to a case study under a refurbishment process,
   to study the specific solutions and to assess the correspondent service
   life using the factor method according the ISO 15686 family. With this
   study, was possible to assess solutions and refurbishment conditions in
   terms of durability, when compared between the different proposals. In
   order to improve the case study Building Life Cycle maintenance, in
   addition, was applied Building Information Modelling (BIM), as BLCM is
   connected with BIM in order to highlight the importance of their
   inter-relationship. This study concludes about the most advantageous
   type of maintenance, how BIM can contributes to BLCM and how can improve
   maintenance plans.
   Thus, this study contributes to highlight the importance of preventive
   maintenance, to promote its implementation and consequently, to use
   maintenance plans reducing life cycle cost and increasing materials
   service life.},

Abstract = {The transportation infrastructure plays an important role in affecting
   the development of the national economy, which has developed rapidly in
   recent years. However, the cost of transportation projects is huge, and
   the traditional project process management causes a waste of time and
   resources. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is widely used in the
   building industry, but also can be used in the whole life cycle of
   transportation projects to improve the project efficiency. SWOT analysis
   is an important tool to assist the development of enterprises by
   analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. In
   this paper the authors use SWOT analysis to investigate the BIM
   application across the whole lifecycle of transportation projects and to
   provide advice for their future development accordingly. The result
   shows that although BIM can save time, money and resources, facilitate
   management and information exchange, and has a wide application
   prospect, there are still some technical and normative problems.
   Interaction between different specialties, information aggregation and
   fusion, and new regulations to deal with new technologies are all the
   problems to be resolved.},

Abstract = {This study pinpoints the benefit of integrating Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Building information modelling (BIM) for different design
   scenarios of a residential building's structural system; (1) reinforced
   concrete solid slab system, (2) steel and (3) composite structural
   system. The environmental impacts for each scenario are evaluated,
   providing insights into the contribution of (1) building life cycle
   stages, (2) structural systems and (3) building materials. Construction
   cost and time were also assessed and compared for each. The results show
   how LCA-BIM integration can streamline the environmental stewardship and
   prioritize action; showing that the building operation stage, the steel
   structural system, slabs and beams as well as reinforced concrete have
   the highest environmental impact, respectively. Hence, this calls for
   acting on building operation as well as the proper design of building
   elements and selection of building materials to reduce the associated
   environmental burden resulting from the building process. (c) 2022 THE

Abstract = {Data-driven green building design in BIM is challenged by the lack of a
   comprehensive data integration framework with the capabilities of
   building life-cycle performance data management and application. This
   paper proposes a performance integrated BIM (P-BIM) framework for
   building life cycle energy efficiency and environment optimization. A
   school building is presented as a case study to verify the P-BIM
   framework and the design optimization workflow established. The results
   show that the optimization can improve IEQ by 11.5\% and reduce LCC by
   36.8\%. The influences of different envelope constructions on indoor
   environment, energy consumptions, and costs are also studied. The P-BIM
   framework and the optimization methodology built on it demonstrate that
   the methodology developed can expand the application scope of BIM and
   contribute to datadriven green building design. More application
   scenarios focusing on the stage of facility management and different
   sustainability performance will be conducted in P-BIM framework in
   future works.},

Abstract = {Today the construction of green buildings is in full swing, and the
   concept of green goes deeply into the hearts of the people. However,
   practitioners in the construction industry often place the emphasis of
   green building construction on the stage of design and construction.
   They hardly realize that green building's operation stage is the most
   important part in the whole life cycle of the building. To build real
   green building, it also needs sustainable development in the operation
   stage. The appearing of BIM (Building Information, Model) technique
   effectively solved this problem. Using BIM technique in operation stage
   can effectively promote work efficiency of the operation organization,
   improve quality of service to customers, reduce the occurrence of
   emergencies in building's operation stage, improve safety performance,
   reduce resources waste and then construct real green buildings.},

   Building Construction Systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper develops a life cycle assessment framework for embodied
   environmental impacts of building construction systems. The framework is
   intended to be used early in the design stage to assist decision making
   in identifying sources of higher embodied impacts and in selecting
   sustainable design alternatives. The framework covers commonly used
   building construction systems such as reinforced concrete construction
   (RCC), hot-rolled steel construction (HRS), and light steel construction
   (LSC). The system boundary is defined for the framework from
   cradle-to-grave plus recycling and reuse possibilities. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment are integrated in
   the developed framework to evaluate life cycle embodied energy and
   embodied greenhouse emissions of design options. The life cycle
   inventory data used to develop the framework were extracted from BIM
   models for the building material quantities, verified Environmental
   Product Declarations (EPD) for the material production stage, and the
   design of construction operations for the construction and end-of-life
   stages. Application of the developed framework to a case study of a
   university building revealed the following results. The material
   production stage had the highest contribution to embodied impacts,
   reaching about 90\%. Compared with the conventional RCC construction
   system, the HRS construction system had 41\% more life cycle embodied
   energy, while the LSC construction system had 34\% less life cycle
   embodied energy. When each system was credited with the net benefits
   resulting from possible recycling/reuse beyond building life, the HRS
   construction system had 10\% less life cycle embodied energy, while the
   LSC construction system had 68\% less life cycle embodied energy.
   Similarly, the HRS construction system had 29\% less life cycle
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the LSC construction system had
   62\% less life cycle GHG emissions. Sustainability assessment results
   showed that the RCC construction system received zero Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credit points, the HRS
   construction system received three LEED credit points, while the LSC
   construction system received five LEED credit points.},

   benefits from information that can be obtained by applying the life
   cycle assessment methodology. The LCA (life cycle assessment) approach
   can be implemented both for a single building material and for the whole
   building. An effective and efficient real application of this
   methodology requires the integration of LCA databases and analysis
   routines to the simulation tools (Building Energy Simulation, Building
   Information Modelling). The integration of LCA tool significantly
   impacts the design efficacy especially in reducing environmental impact
   of the construction industry. This paper reviews the integrated LCA
   tools in simulation software currently available for BIM platforms and
   will explore the possibilities given to restorative design informed by
   LCA analysis, through a test on two construction typologies for a case

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for the energetic consumption and potential
   greenhouse gas emissions during their life cycle. Water heating system
   contribute to a building's energetic consumption, mainly in residential
   units, throughout the building's operational phase. Variability in
   energy sources, reservation and distribution systems of hot water along
   with the types of construction materials used in these building systems
   are key decisions to make in the initial design phases of a building
   project. Often, the definition of the most appropriate water heating
   system for a building is made via a technical-economic decision.
   However, the decision is rarely based on natural resource consumption
   and environmental impact generation throughout the life-cycle of the
   heating systems and of buildings as a whole. This study presents an
   application of a specific environmental management tool, based on an
   integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life-Cycle Analysis
   (LCA) method for selection of hot water systems, during the early design
   building phase. The proposed approach is implemented in the
   pre-operational phase, in order to enable decision makers to appreciate
   the resulting environmental performance of water heating systems in
   buildings. The applicability of the framework is tested via a
   comparative study of solar heating water systems and natural gas heating
   water systems for a residential multifamily building to be constructed
   in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For the indicators damage to human health and
   damage to ecosystem, results indicate that the greatest impact on global
   warming comes from the natural gas heating system, while for solar
   heating, free particulate matter was the highest negative contribution.
   The operation phase for the natural gas system was highest for climate
   change while for solar heating system, it was the fresh water that was
   impacted the most during the pre-operational phase of the system's use.},

Abstract = {Architecture is one of the important factors that cause environmental
   pollution. This study aims to strengthen the application of green design
   concept in architecture, promote the sustainable development of
   architecture, and realize the rational utilization of public resources.
   First, according to the life cycle and sustainable development theories,
   building sustainability is divided into three levels: economy,
   environment, and society. Second, based on the building information
   modeling (BIM) technology, the economic evaluation model, environmental
   evaluation model, and social evaluation model of sustainable building
   life cycle are established. Moreover, the life cycle cost, environmental
   impact evaluation, and social impact evaluation of buildings at
   different stages are analyzed to realize the comprehensive evaluation of
   building sustainability and promote the green development of
   architectural design. The results denote that the pre-project cost
   accounts for the lowest proportion in the sustainable life cycle of
   buildings without discount. The operation and maintenance cost is the
   highest, accounting for 65.4\%. Regarding net present value, the project
   cost is mainly installation, outdoor, etc., with 61.5\%, while the
   proportion of operation and maintenance expenses and demolition expenses
   decreases. According to the social assessment of the sustainable
   building life cycle, workers' welfare greatly impacts society, among
   which fair salary, health, and social welfare have an impact degree of
   0.15, 0.175, and 1.714, respectively. Economically, after considering
   the discount rate, operation and maintenance can save costs more
   effectively. At the environmental level, there are differences in the
   evaluation of environmental impact at different stages of the building
   life cycle. The social welfare at the worker level has the most
   significant impact on society, which extends to all stages of the
   building life cycle, and the impact at the worker level is higher than
   the social value level, which is consistent with the actual situation,
   and verifies the quantifiable ability of the model to the social
   sustainability of buildings. In this study, life cycle cost analysis and
   BIM technology are integrated to realize the evaluation of building
   sustainability in economic, environmental, and social aspects, thus
   enhancing the development of sustainability in the field of architecture
   and making some contributions to promoting the rational utilization of
   public resources.},

Abstract = {The vast majority of scientists and policy makers agree that
   environmental impacts of buildings need to be reduced significantly, and
   that Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology well suited to support
   this. The importance of evaluating potential improvements to the
   environmental life cycle performance of buildings in early design stages
   is widely acknowledged; the wide application of LCA during design
   however, is restrained by the great uncertainty in design and material
   decisions at this stage. To support decision making in the early design
   stage, we propose an approach using Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   to assess a wide range of construction options and their embodied
   environmental impact. We use a conceptual BIM model to evaluate a
   variety of material compositions for different building elements and the
   potential contribution of elements to the total embodied impact of the
   building design. The BIM-integrated approach enables identification of
   design specific hotspots which can be visualized on the building model
   for communication of LCA results and visual design guidance.},

Abstract = {The construction and building sector is one of the largest contributors
   to the global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to
   accurately assess the carbon emissions of buildings throughout the life
   cycle. Many studies conducted life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings
   to evaluate carbon emissions. However, due to the lack of dynamic data,
   most studies adopted the static LCA methodology, which neglected the
   dynamic variations during life cycle stages of a building. Unlike
   previous studies that collected static data from questionnaires and
   documents, the present study aims to establish a novel dynamic life
   cycle assessment (D-LCA) framework for buildings by incorporating the
   building information modeling (BIM) and the building energy modeling
   program (BEMP) into the static LCA. First, a static LCA is established
   as the baseline scenario that covers the ``cradle-to-grave{''} life
   cycle stages. A BIM model is established using Revit to obtain the
   inventory of building materials. The Designer Simulation Toolkit (DeST)
   is used as a BEMP to simulate the operating energy consumption of the
   studied building, taking into account changes in energy mix, climate
   change, and occupant behavior. At the same time, the DeST results are
   further used as a data input for dynamic scenarios. The D-LCA framework
   is applied to a high-rise commercial building in China. This study found
   that the difference between static and dynamic},

Abstract = {The research addresses the issue that there is no an integrated approach
   or model to activate and implement sustainability in a project
   throughout its life and not benefit from the potentials of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) technology in achieving and supporting all
   sustainability aspects as a human need. Therefore, the research aims to
   establish and achieve a Sustainable BIM Model for applying within
   projects throughout their life cycle, managing the relationship between
   BIM and sustainability, and obtaining best interoperability performance.
   Consequently, sustainability and the potentials of dealing with it by
   modern techniques and tools were investigated and identified to simulate
   its indicators and criteria. Besides, strategies to establish
   sustainability that can be activated. Then related sustainability
   indicators to the performance of project aspects were collected and
   categorized to facilitate linking with BIM platforms. Moreover, the
   potentials of the overlap between sustainability and many BIM platforms
   were examined and demonstrated, and their employability in supporting
   sustainability aspects in a balanced manner. Eventually, a methodology
   to manage the relationship between BIM and sustainability was deduced
   and formulated to achieve a Sustainable BIM Model during a building life

   Building Information Model (BIM) integrates multiple properties with 3D

   In this contribution, the potential and methods of integration of BIM,

   FACILITIES},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {95-105},
Abstract = {Statement of the problem. The subject of the research is information
   models of a complete life project in the sector of architecture, design
   and construction and maintenance of buildings and structures. The
   purpose of the research is to optimize BIM technologies by building a
   model based on a discrete vector data description.
   Results. Analyzed the main obstacles to the widespread introduction of
   BIM technologies and procedures for the full life cycle of a
   construction project in the practice of the construction complex of the
   Russian Federation throughout the entire life cycle of the project,
   including the stages of construction, operation and disposal, as well as
   global trends in this process. The method of BIM dimension reduction
   based on discrete vector data description is formulated. The technology
   of forming a hierarchical dynamically added and updated information base
   BIM, taking into account the possibility of its aggregation, has been
   developed. The algorithms proposed in this work are implemented in the
   shell of a relational database management system.
   Conclusions. BIM dimension reduction, based on a discrete vector
   description of data, allows you to completely solve the problems of both
   designing and updating the BIM information base, and its transfer
   between project participants. BIM data formats are determined by the
   stage of the complete project life cycle. Fully functional for the stage
   of determining the scope of work on a project, BIM is one-dimensional
   and is simply determined by the vector of clusters of a lower degree of
   integration, which allows you to completely overcome all obstacles to
   the widespread introduction of BIM technologies and procedures of the
   full life cycle of a construction project into practice. The optimal
   shell for the implementation of BIM technologies is relational

Abstract = {The construction and building sectors are one of the highest consumers
   of resources and energy. Literature evidences the potentialities of the
   design phase towards the improvement of environmental, economic and
   social performance of buildings. Thus, the Life Cycle Sustainability
   Assessment (LCSA). approach is recognized as suitable method. It is
   based on the ``triple bottom line{''} principle, to calculate
   environmental, economic, social impacts produced by buildings during its
   life cycle. The present paper aims to present a methodological framework
   based on an LCSA, used during design stages of buildings and integrated
   into a building's design technology such as Building Information
   Modeling (BIM). A conceptual approach to conduct the data integration
   and a possible workflow to integrate the LCSA into BIM is proposed. The
   value of the present approach is the possibility to conduct quantitative
   environmental, economic and social assessment of buildings to guide
   designers to measure and predict the building's performance.},

Title = {Critical review of bim-based LCA method to buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {110-120},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Current environmental problems arising from the building sector require
   tools to help reduce resource consumption and environmental impact. Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used tool to quantify the
   environmental impacts of the building sector. The literature recognizes
   the need to simplify the method application, especially to reduce and
   optimize data acquisition. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   defined as a virtual 3D building model which integrates with a database
   of their building elements. Several studies recognize that the
   integration of BIM and LCA can simplify data acquisition of the building
   as well as provide both tools with feedback. This paper reviews recent
   studies centered on BIM-based LCA, and also carries out a methodological
   analysis of their integration, focusing on the way that BIM can
   contribute to simplifying data input, and optimize output data and
   results during the LCA application in buildings. The results show the
   viability to develop methods based on BIM models for organizing building
   information used to estimate environmental and energy consumption
   impacts based on LCA, including: templates and plug-ins for BIM
   software, and the integration of automated processes combining different
   data and software. Reviewed papers are simplified LCA applications,
   mostly focused on CO2 emission calculation during the early stages of
   design. Finally, methodological challenges and recommendations for BIM
   and LCA tools are propose. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {BIM-DLCA: An integrated dynamic environmental impact assessment model
   for buildings},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important and widely used
   environmental impact quantification methodology. Recently, temporal
   variations have generated renewed interests in LCA, with dynamic LCA
   (DLCA) becoming a new research trend. Traditional data collection
   approaches are considerably time and effort intensive, with major
   challenges associated with the acquisition of high quality data that are
   available. This study integrates building information modeling (BIM)
   with DLCA to develop a new assessment model for buildings. It follows
   the basic LCA paradigm and includes five parts: goal and scope
   definition, BIM module, dynamic database, dynamic assessment, and
   interpretation. In the BIM-DLCA model, BIM was used to extract material
   information and the construction schedule. A number of analysis software
   and simulation tools were used to quantify the temporal elementary flows
   throughout the lifecycle of the building. Various forms of dynamic data
   were aggregated to create a database that supports dynamic assessment. A
   case study was used to testify the BIM-DLCA model and the case study's
   outcomes indicate that BIM has the potential to simplify data collection
   process and support DLCA. The proposed BIM-DLCA model is operable in
   practice. With the rapid development of digitalization and intelligence,
   the proposed BIM-DLCA model lays an important foundation for future
   assessment studies and promotes smart LCA.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with Building Information Modeling (BIM) on a general
   level. Upon literature and practice research, we discovered that BIM
   ontology has not been properly defined during project life cycle on the
   whole. There are various existing interpretations of BIM and related
   acronyms, but these interpretations only describe BIM from a specific
   perspective regardless to general relationships. This can result in
   problems and misunderstandings during communication, coordination and
   contracting. Research shows, that it is possible to understand BIM in
   three different ways: 1) BIM as a product, 2) BIM as a method and 3) BIM
   as a methodology. This paper also explores broader understanding of BIM
   as a methodology and proposes the correct BIM ontology we use
   schematics, and explain the role of BIM in traditional project life
   cycle phases. We propose strict differentiation between model and
   modeling, and we describe relationships between BIM and other IM (i.e.
   PIM, PLIM, CIM, DIM and AIM). Proposed ontology ought to be useful in
   both research and practice. In BIM standardization process, BIM
   implementation, and development of BIM related tools, it is necessary
   that all parties understand common ontology in the same way. In the end,
   the paper also summarizes the impact of research results and their
   possible use in practice. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) creates tremendous value for civil
   engineering through information integration. Not only does it make the
   formulation of data storage strategies more important at the beginning
   of a civil engineering project, but it also shows the potential value of
   further research into a unified BIM model that highly integrates all
   information in the project life cycle. However, it is not easy to store
   all the information in the project life cycle into a unified BIM model.
   To achieve this goal, this study proposed a shareable BIM back-end data
   system object-oriented database for BIM front-end applications
   (BIM-OODB), and established its complete system configuration. Based on
   the database design theory, three main aspects of BIM-OODB design are
   discussed, namely use case design, architecture design, and schema
   design. Then, four demonstration cases were selected to discuss the
   system implementation process of BIM-OODB in building and infrastructure
   projects. The results show that BIM-OODB has the potential to enable all
   participants to work around the unified shareable data system throughout
   the project life cycle. This study provides a reference for civil
   engineers to formulate data storage strategies in the early stage of a
   civil engineering projects and IT engineers to develop civil engineering
   data applications.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology of integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) to evaluate the
   economic implications of designing aging-in-place (AIP) homes at the
   conceptual stage. With the rising global aging population, there is a
   growing demand for housing tailored to elderly needs. This study
   emphasizes the importance of early design phases, offering a
   semi-automated model to estimate life cycle costs from design to
   disposal. The model enables comprehensive economic assessments,
   highlighting the long-term feasibility of design decisions by
   considering life cycle costs early in the process. Investing in
   accessible and universal design features upfront can lead to long-term
   savings by reducing the need for extensive future retrofits. The model
   allows for comparisons among different design alternatives, assessing
   the financial impact of features such as wider doorways, accessible
   bathrooms, and elevators. This study provides valuable insights for
   designers and homeowners, supporting efficient decision-making during
   the early design stages of AIP homes.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been significantly transformed by the
   implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which has
   facilitated extensive project management capabilities across the entire
   life cycle. Notwithstanding its advantages, there exist certain
   limitations that hinder its extensive implementation. This study aims to
   investigate the disparities related to the adoption of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) by conducting a thorough analysis of factors
   such as data interoperability, standardization, collaboration, skill
   gaps, and resistance to change. The data were collected through a
   preliminary pilot survey and a primary questionnaire. The collected data
   were then subjected to analysis using two statistical techniques:
   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Partial Least Squares Structural
   Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This study reveals noteworthy associations
   between the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and several
   crucial factors, including Continuous Integration (CI), Monitoring and
   Control (MC), Project Management (PM), Resolution and Performance (RP),
   Structural Management (SM), Sustainability Administration (SA), and
   Value Management (VM). This study provides valuable insights for
   professionals and policymakers, offering recommendations to enhance the
   implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advocating for
   additional research on complementary factors. Through the identification
   and subsequent resolution of recognized shortcomings, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) can be employed in a proficient manner to
   augment collaboration, mitigate costs, optimize energy efficiency, and
   implement sustainable construction methodologies. The present study
   makes a substantial contribution to the progress of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) adoption and the efficient management of construction
   project life cycles.},

Abstract = {In the context of the general trend to accelerate change, the actual
   goal of scientific research in the field of construction is to analyze
   and design the stages of the life cycle of a construction object. The
   object of the study becomes the information model of the life cycle of
   the building. It is studied and modeled based on the concept of real
   estate development and using the methods of project analysis of the
   construction project. The widest possibilities for obtaining and
   analyzing data on the state of a construction object, as well as the
   possibilities of systematizing information flows and information
   modeling of different periods of its life cycle, are realized in the
   approach of BIM modeling of buildings and structures. With the help of
   BIM-modeling tools, mandatory stages and possible phases of the life
   cycle of a building object can be represented as hierarchically and
   sequentially related information flows, in which the attributes of each
   stage of the life cycle are formed under the influence of the preceding
   stages and of special factors for the considered stage. As a result, the
   project documentation should reflect the decisions aimed at providing
   the necessary conditions and opportunities for subsequent periods of the
   life cycle of the construction object, as well as the most adapted for
   the predicted changes and transformations for all future stages and
   phases. The analysis of characteristics and the developed structure of
   simple and complex construction works allows determining for each stage
   and phase of the life cycle of a construction object: interconnection of
   information flows, composition and content of the information model of
   the building required for the work of specialists.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely accepted for evaluating a
   building's environmental footprint. Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   has become the go-to strategy for LCA during design. Still, despite
   BIM-LCA automating detailed quantity extraction, challenges persist,
   such as a lack of standardised geometry modelling and information
   management, as well as a common language between LCA and BIM data. This
   study proposes a method to assess embodied carbon from BIM models
   classified using a construction classification system that provides a
   data structure, maps BIM objects and environmental impacts in LCA
   databases, and matches different levels of development (LoD) in BIM
   models. The method was tested on real-world models, resulting in 375
   kgCO2e/m2 for the single residential and 426 kgCO2e/m2 for the
   multi-residential building. These findings revealed its ability to adapt
   to different LoD and modelling techniques, expedite assessing different
   design options, and potentially save up to 20 hours of work remodelling.},

Title = {Digital Twin Aided Sustainability and Vulnerability Audit for Subway
   Stations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) or so-called `building information model (BIM)' has
   brought great revolution to the current building industry. Its
   applications to life cycle management of buildings and infrastructures
   can further increase the social and economic benefits. As a complete
   information model, a digital twin integrates the information of a
   project from different stages of the life cycle into a model, in order
   to facilitate better asset management and communicate through data
   visualizations with participants. This paper unprecedently introduces a
   digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station.
   Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new
   study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life
   cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the
   project is the highest, accounting for 78\% of the total cost. However,
   the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is
   higher than the amount during the production of building materials,
   accounting for 67\%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66\% of
   the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was
   mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum
   alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73\% and 17.64\%, respectively. In
   addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The
   digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential
   solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life
   cycle cost and carbon footprint. This initiative is relatively new to
   the industry. The new insight into life cycle assessment or LCA
   (especially carbon footprint over the life cycle) integrated with
   digital twin applications will enable sustainable development that will
   enhance resilience of metro railway systems globally.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to leverage the implementation of building
   information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM), and thus the
   integration of BIM and FM are explored. It looks at identifying the
   information needed to implement BIM application in FM, to determine the
   level of implementation of BIMFM as well as to recommend BIMFM
   application mapping for building life cycle.
   Design/methodology/approachThis study applied qualitative methodology,
   upon which a purposive sampling to 16 interviewees were conducted among
   professionals involved in any BIM, FM, BIMFM projects. Final analysis
   was conducted using thematical analysis by ATLAS.ti software.
   FindingsThe types of information required to implement BIMFM range from
   managerial information, commercial information, technical information
   and all full life cycle data. The implementation of BIMFM is agreed as
   beneficial, as it builds up efficiency of building performance, able to
   close gap of loses information, helps to improve FM in terms of data
   management, mitigates the problems, identifies priority defects and to
   enhance the FM processes. Respondents also believed that the causes
   where there is no implementation of BIMFM is in the situations where
   things are in order and when it becomes very expensive.
   Originality/valueThis paper has managed to gather the essential elements
   toward leveraging the implementation of BIMFM in digital construction
   project which are in the means of information types, the needs of BIMFM
   implementation and towards the end drawing the BIMFM implementation plan
   framework that could be used as a reference for the practitioners and

Abstract = {The selection of cost-effective components of the building envelope
   plays a significant role in a sustainable building design solution.
   Therefore, in terms of effective decision-making, it is important to
   have a complete insight into construction and running costs throughout
   the lifespan of the building. A systematic building information
   modelling (BIM) approach as a new trend in the innovative approaches in
   the construction (AECO) industry provides appropriate support for
   improvement of environmental assessments. Our study presents a new
   approach to automated/semi-automated comprehensive energy and the whole
   life-cycle cost analysis of building envelope components using BIM, and,
   as such, it represents a novelty for Advanced Construction Project
   Management. It focuses on the sequence of steps required for evaluation
   of energy and economic assessment, from the basic 3D BIM model, through
   the energy and cost analysis, to the final evaluation and
   decision-making. The energy balance was calculated with dynamic
   simulation, the results of which formed the basis for the cost analysis.
   Economic assessment of construction and operating costs was performed by
   implementation of the cost-optimal methodology. Our proposed approach
   contributes to the environmental assessment of building envelope
   components throughout the life cycle and includes the economic
   valuation. The applicability of the systematic approach in our case
   study considered 24 different variants of building envelope components
   at three different U-values, namely U-0 = 0.28 W/m(2)K for external
   wall, U-0 = 0.20 W/m(2)K for roof, U-1 = 0.15 W/m(2)K and U-2 = 0.10
   W/m(2)K. Sophisticated project BIM management software was used for the
   economic evaluation of all elements of the life-cycle costs (LCC). In
   summary, the main contribution of this approach is provision of a
   comprehensive and simple insight into all costs in a transparent way,
   because a 5D BIM model allows for optimal decision-making on appropriate
   energy and cost-efficient envelope components.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has become more interested in moving towards
   implementing an innovative method to reduce wastes and Environmental
   Impacts (EIs) during the construction stage. Tools and methods
   represented in different frameworks to estimate construction wastes are
   limited to the end of life stage of building projects. A common method
   employed for this quantification is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which
   is globally recognized as one of the most complete methods for the
   environmental impact assessment of buildings. Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) would be an ideal platform to integrate LCA to assist in
   this process. However, BIM and LCA tools are currently not fully
   interoperable. This research aims to represent a methodology to quantify
   total waste produced in the building's lifecycle. The main reasons for
   producing waste are examined profoundly and some solutions leading to
   waste reduction are proposed. Additionally, the environmental impact of
   the materials converted to waste is evaluated in an integrated
   environment by developing an add-in inside BIM tool, which calculates
   waste produced in each step of buildings' lifespan to be used by LCA
   tool. An application of an actual building project will be presented in
   order to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed
   approaches.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Number = {A},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although prefabrication is considered a sustainable construction
   technology that can reduce various construction waste, research on its
   potential for concrete formwork waste reduction is currently limited.
   This study proposes an approach integrating life cycle assessment (LCA)
   and building and information modelling (BIM) to quantify the possible
   life-cycle formwork waste reduction through prefabrication from a
   construction project, in which LCA serves as a systematic assessment
   framework and BIM provides the basic inventory for LCA. A typical
   reinforced concrete frame structural building located in Nanjing, China
   is chosen for a case study to demonstrate and validate the proposed
   approach. Results show that prefabrication can reduce formwork waste by
   59.68\%-71.83\%, which mainly comes from straight walls and slabs. This
   figure can continuously increase to as high as 90\% if the
   prefabrication is further applied and promoted. Findings from this study
   contribute to the understanding of the environmental benefits of
   prefabrication. This is of great significance for designers, engineers,
   and governments who are constantly seeking ways toward sustainable
   construction.},

Abstract = {The environmental crisis requires the immediate implementation of
   accurate and robust sustainable solutions throughout the building life
   cycle. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is a scientifically
   recognised method that integrates the triple dimensions of the life
   cycle approach, and thereby enabling the evaluation of the performance
   of mitigation strategies implemented in building projects. However,
   implementing the LCSA in buildings is limited by the weighting of
   environmental, economic, and social dimensions to select the best option
   regarding the numerous materials available. In order to fill this
   knowledge gap, the paper aims to present the developed Smart BIM3LCA
   tool, which supports multi-dimensional assessment during the project's
   early design steps. Automatic integration of the LCSA, a multi-criteria
   decision-making tool such as TOPSIS, and building information modelling
   (BIM), was developed to support the selection of building materials. The
   BIM plug-in was then validated through its application to a multi-family
   residential building to select the most sustainable materials during the
   project's early design stage.},

Abstract = {BIM (Building Information Modeling) provides opportunities to improve
   the existing process of the whole life cycle project management,
   especially in the design phase and maintenance phase. However, BIM has
   not sufficiently played an effective role in the stage of construction
   but mainly contributed in design. The process of on-site construction
   management is a critical one for the execution of construction projects,
   which have an urgent demand to take full use of BIM to improve its
   efficiency and productivity. This paper introduces a conceptual
   framework of real-time BIM framework for the on-site construction
   management. The conceptual framework integrates BIM with sensing
   technology, which then interacted by augmented reality (AR) and mobile
   computing technology. The proposed framework will provide initial work
   for the wide scale of BIM implementation in construction projects.},

Abstract = {Buildings produce a large amount of carbon emissions in their life
   cycle, which intensifies greenhouse-gas effects and has become a great
   threat to the survival of humans and other species. Although many
   previous studies shed light on the calculation of carbon emissions, a
   systematic analysis framework is still missing. Therefore, this study
   proposes an analysis framework of carbon emissions based on building
   information modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA), which
   consists of four steps: (1) defining the boundary of carbon emissions in
   a life cycle; (2) establishing a carbon emission coefficients database
   for Chinese buildings and adopting Revit, GTJ2018, and Green Building
   Studio for inventory analysis; (3) calculating carbon emissions at each
   stage of the life cycle; and (4) explaining the calculation results of
   carbon emissions. The framework developed is validated using a case
   study of a hospital project, which is located in areas in Anhui, China
   with a hot summer and a cold winter. The results show that the
   reinforced concrete engineering contributes to the largest proportion of
   carbon emissions (around 49.64\%) in the construction stage, and the
   HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) generates the largest
   proportion (around 53.63\%) in the operational stage. This study
   provides a practical reference for similar buildings in analogous areas
   and for additional insights on reducing carbon emissions in the future.},

Abstract = {The current building life cycle management system in the Russian
   Federation is a family of discrete subsystems that exist independently
   for different building life cycle stages. In this situation building
   reliability and sustainable functioning are out of the question. The
   implementation of a united information model (BIM-model) intended to
   describe building entire life cycle will allow to raise the
   sustainability, but this will happen only if goals and concerns of all
   participants of the project process are properly coordinated. An
   important figure of process sustainability is the organizational and
   technological reliability (OTR) that describes the possibility of a
   system to reach a goal. In case of building life cycle design, the
   economical efficiency of a building can be considered as the goal. The
   required technical, ecological, organizational, and other parameters
   form a complex of constraints that determine the area of allowable
   values for building functioning. In its broad meaning, OTR may be
   understood as the probability of receiving an economical effect based on
   the value of organizational and economical reliability (OER).},

Title = {Life-cycle building information modelling (BIM) engaged framework for
   improving building energy performance},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {231},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The building sector is responsible for 32\% of global energy consumption
   and 19\% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent
   requirement for energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission
   reduction in the building sector has been recognised at the highest
   level of governments around the world. One potential solution, which has
   yet to be critically considered, is the application of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome building energy performance gap
   (BEPG), defined as the discrepancy between the designed and actual
   energy consumption in buildings. This study performs a systematic and
   comprehensive literature review to identify the specific causes of the
   BEPG, and then analyses the application of BIM for addressing the BEPG.
   A life-cycle BIM engaged framework was developed, including the function
   of ``information exchange{''}, ``design review{''}, ``energy-related
   quality control{''}, ``life-cycle commissioning{''}, and ``real-time
   operation and maintenance management{''}. It is expected that the
   proposed framework will assist researchers and practitioners better
   understand application of BIM to systematically improve building energy
   performance. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The management of the life cycle of large publicly owned social housing
   complexes requires a large amount of human and technological resources,
   the optimization of which is a desirable and shared objective. This
   article proposes a workflow for the enhancement of these management
   processes based on BIM (Building Information Modelling), a methodology
   capable of integrating architectural information into a
   three-dimensional graphic model. The proposed workflow defines the basic
   characteristics of the BIM model oriented toward sustainable building
   management and its relationship with the key moments of its life cycle.
   It also analyzes the architectural information associated with the
   models and determines which parameters are optimal for their completion
   from the BIM models in terms of reliability, auditability, and
   automation. For this purpose, a case study has been developed for a
   multifamily residential building in Malaga (Spain), owned by the
   Andalusian Housing and Rehabilitation Agency AVRA, a public agency that
   manages a housing stock of more than 70,000 dwellings.},

Title = {EMBEDDING LIFE CYCLE COSTING IN 5D BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {145-167},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is the consideration of all `relevant' costs
   and revenues associated with the acquisition and ownership of an asset.
   LCC has a number of relevant applications, these include project
   appraisal; facilities management; procurement and tendering and as a
   means to evaluate sustainable construction. Although these advantages
   are well recognised, the process is underutilised due to a number of
   documented barriers to adoption. Notably these include lack of accurate
   historical databases; the perceived complexity and time consuming nature
   of the calculations; lack of a standard LCC methodology, and that
   clients are not requesting LCC. The research presented is framed in
   recognition of these barriers, investigating a process that could affect
   change by increasing efficiency in this area. A Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) approach to construction procurement is being
   increasingly utilised as a collaborative set of procedures and
   associated technologies that assist design and construction professions
   in conceiving, designing, constructing and operating the built
   environment. Although 5D BIM (Cost Modelling) is currently being used in
   Quantity Surveying (QS) practice, BIM is not extensively used in the
   application of LCC and there has been limited research in this area to
   date. The research demonstrates the development of a 5D BIM based LCC
   solution, where LCC is integrated into the 5D BIM process by embedding
   an LCC calculation model structure within an existing 5D BIM technology.
   This process represents a change to the 5D BIM workflow, adding on a
   facility for LCC through post-processing BIM data. The research is
   carried out under a design science research methodology, to develop and
   then evaluate the solution proposed. An evaluation method known as
   `Thinking Aloud cooperative evaluation' is used to gain feedback from a
   sample of QSs utilising the 5D BIM based LCC solution. The purpose of
   the evaluation is to gauge whether LCC can be effectively embedded in a
   5D BIM platform. The contribution to knowledge is the articulation of a
   process which extends 5D BIM for LCC, by leveraging an existing 5D BIM
   technology. The findings outline that the primary benefits of the
   proposed process/system is that it allows for a link between the QSs
   cost plans/BOQ's and their LCC calculations in an integrated
   environment.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an evolutionary idea designed to
   ensure performance is evaluated continuously over the whole life of a
   given asset. Over the last decade significant emphasis has been placed
   on the design and management of construction projects by using the 7
   layers, or dimensions (D), of BIM (3D Modeling, 4D Time, 5D Cost, 6D
   Procurement and 7D Sustainability). Moreover, it has been argued that
   the 7th dimension (7D) that is related to sustainability could impact
   the other six dimensions of the BIM concept. Sustainability indicates
   the relationship between economic, social and environmental
   considerations. The relative sustainability of any building will in part
   be dependent on the nature of these three considerations over its whole
   life. However, economic, social and environmental characteristics are
   likely to be subject to change over time, the precise nature of which
   cannot be predicted. Consequently, any such changes can introduce
   vulnerabilities in terms of performance. Hence, the hypothesis of this
   research is that the pre-identification of economic, social or
   environmental uncertainties within a BIM platform could help reduce
   performance vulnerabilities during the project management life cycle.
   This necessarily includes consideration of the post-occupancy phase.
   Therefore this study aims to explore uncertainties within the 7D of BIM
   that could influence and impact the other six dimensions of BIM and vice
   versa. The study uses secondary data to establish which social, economic
   and environmental data have to be mined using advanced techniques and
   technologies to identify key uncertainties that could help project
   stakeholders to make early, efficient decisions. In other words, project
   stakeholders could pre-identify those uncertainties in order to avoid
   vulnerable results during the project management life cycle (from the
   design phase to the post-occupancy phase) during the application of BIM
   philosophies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Sustainable buildings with minimum energy consumption and with less
   negative impact to environment becomes an important goal of public and
   private organization all over the world. On the other hand, energy cost
   has a high contribution with the building Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for the
   owners. Subsequently, reducing energy consumption by selecting the best
   design options during the initial stages of any residential project is
   one of the key factors to that issue. The target of the proposed
   framework is to find the optimal design that gives a minimum life cycle
   cost over the building life span. The integration between Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to reach
   the near-optimal solution. BIM is the simulation tool to generate the
   building design and dynamically analysis for the energy consumption of
   the house. The role of GA is to reach the solution by setting the
   effective variables and use a measurable objective function with proper
   constraints. The proposed model automatically identifies the most
   suitable house components to reach the minimum LCC during the design
   stage. Parametric programming language is used to facilitate
   interoperability between BIM and the other components of the model.},

Abstract = {The importance of evaluation and improvement of life cycle performance
   of buildings in early design stages is widely acknowledged, the wide
   application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) however, is restrained by big
   uncertainty in design and material decisions at this stage. The approach
   presented in this paper aims to provide a proof-of-concept for an
   integrated assessment of the environmental impact of building
   construction using Building Information Modeling (BIM). To support
   decision-making in the critical early design stages, we propose a
   workflow of using conceptual BIM models and visual scripting to test a
   wide variety of possible construction options. The overall effects on
   the building's total impact are calculated for the various options to
   identify design specific hotspots. Different aspects of the results can
   be visualized to support intuitive design guidance. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to develop, test and summarise lessons
   learned using two different methods for data integration between
   autonomous software packages for design models, cost calculations and
   cost databases with regard to generating life-cycle costing analysis.
   The two developed methods followed the principles of compatibility and
   interoperability and were tested in three test cases: a simplistic
   design model, a university building model and a private company's office
   building model. The compatible method entailed an MS Excel tool while
   the interoperable method followed a more automated procedure through a
   visual programming environment. Both methods were, however, facing
   several obstacles with regard to data integration across autonomous
   software packages and automated procedures for calculation of life-cycle
   cost which in turn left plenty of manual work and made the results prone

Journal = {ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},

Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Using building information modeling (BIM) and Ecotect, this paper
   estimated carbon emissions during an office building's life cycle. This
   building's life cycle CO2 emissions were divided into three parts: the
   construction, operation, and demolition stages. Among these, the
   statistics on the schedule of quantities were generated using BIM, and
   the energy consumption during the building's operational stage was
   obtained using ECOTECT simulation. Sensitivity analysis was performed by
   changing several alternative parameters, to identify which parameter has
   more impacts on building performance. The paper demonstrated that (1)
   BIM and Ecotect are very helpful in estimating carbon emissions from a
   building's life cycle, (2) the primary and effective measures to reduce
   the building's CO2 emissions in hot and humid climate should be arranged
   as follows: (a) within the limits of comfort, reducing the fresh air
   volume; (b) extending the indoor temperature range; (c) improving the
   thermal insulation performance of exterior windows, walls, and roofs;
   (d) exploiting natural ventilation during transition seasons, and (3)
   currently there are some limitations in performing LCA based on BIM and
   Ecotect.},

Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {657-675},
Abstract = {Purpose The aim of this research is to examine if building information
   modelling (BIM) is feasible as an information management platform to
   determine a financially and environmentally affordable housing
   refurbishment solution based on the life cycle cost (LCC) and LCC
   calculation.
   Design/methodology/approach A case study in conjunction with BIM
   simulation approach using BIM tools (Autodesk Revit and IES VE/IMPACT)
   was adopted to identify the feasibility of BIM for the simultaneous
   formulation of LCC and life cycle assessment in housing refurbishment.
   Findings This research reveals that BIM is a suitable for the
   information management platform to enable construction professionals to
   consider trade-off relationship between LCC and life cycle assessment
   simultaneously, and determine the most financially and environmentally
   affordable refurbishment solution. The interoperability issues in data
   exchange among different BIM tools and unstandardized BIM object
   libraries with incomplete data sets of construction materials are
   recognised as the major shortcomings in a BIM system. Essential remedial
   actions to overcome the shortcomings in the current BIM tools are
   identified.
   Research limitations/implications Actual housing information and various
   refurbishment materials for the BIM simulation are limited.
   Practical implications This research contributes to supporting
   construction professionals to prepare practical BIM adoption for the
   integration of the LCC and life cycle assessment that can significantly
   improve early decision-makings on sustainable housing refurbishment.
   Originality/value This research will contribute to providing proper
   remedial actions to overcome the shortcomings in the current BIM tools,
   and insights for construction professionals to understand the
   implication of BIM-embedded housing refurbishment.},

Abstract = {Building materials with a low environmental impact are critical to the
   sustainability of the built environment. The environmental impact of
   materials can be determined by a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA),
   which constitutes multiple parameters such as the water used in a
   material's life cycle. To use the LCIA approach for building material
   selection, its parameters need to be assigned different weights, which
   is the primary objective of this study. Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) can play an influential role when using LCIA during the building
   design process. With this consideration, we study the attention given to
   environmental sustainability in buildings and the responsiveness of BIM
   in this case. A multi-regional survey of 120 experts from academia and
   industry was conducted. The results show the relative importance of LCIA
   parameters and the focus of the building sector on environmental
   sustainability. The current and the future responsiveness of BIM towards
   environmental sustainability is also indicated. To promote the
   integration of LCIA in building design and performance assessment, the
   future role of BIM applications is explored. The results will contribute
   to research and practice in the sustainable built environment by helping
   select environment-friendly building materials.},

Title = {Building-information-modeling enabled life cycle assessment, a case
   study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {729-743},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle
   to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle
   of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the
   same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA
   results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not
   trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies
   estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase
   quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of
   construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to
   mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually
   estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice
   undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision
   supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart
   transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents
   a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to
   facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC
   transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a
   residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools
   and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and
   interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used
   to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction
   machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and
   simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a
   China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The
   Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73\%) to
   calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent
   database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The
   results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg
   CO(2)eq/m(2). The operation phase contributes to 69\% of the total
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production
   contributes to 24\%. Concrete is the most used building material, which
   accounts for 82\% of mass but contributes to only 44\% of the material
   related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6\%
   and 1.4\% of mass, they contribute to 28\% and 17\% GHG emission,
   respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle
   environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail.
   This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for
   the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of
   buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Integrated BIM-Based LCA for the Entire Building Process Using an
   Existing Structure for Cost Estimation in the Swiss Context},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The building sector has a significant potential to reduce the material
   resource demand needed for construction and therefore, greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions. Digitalization can help to make use of this potential
   and improve sustainability throughout the entire building's life cycle.
   One way to address this potential is through the integration of Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) into the building process by employing Building
   Information Modeling (BIM). BIM can reduce the effort needed to carry
   out an LCA, and therefore, facilitate the integration into the building
   process. A review of current industry practice and scientific literature
   shows that companies are lacking the incentive to apply LCA. If applied,
   there are two main approaches. Either the LCA is performed in a
   simplified way at the beginning of the building process using imprecise
   techniques, or it is done at the very end when all the needed
   information is available, but it is too late for decision-making. One
   reason for this is the lack of methods, workflows and tools to implement
   BIM-LCA integration over the whole building development. Therefore, the
   main objective of this study is to develop an integrated BIM-LCA method
   for the entire building process by relating it to an established
   workflow. To avoid an additional effort for practitioners, an existing
   structure for cost estimation in the Swiss context is used. The
   established method is implemented in a tool and used in a case study in
   Switzerland to test the approach. The results of this study show that
   LCA can be performed continuously in each building phase over the entire
   building process using existing Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   techniques for cost estimation. The main benefit of this approach is
   that it simplifies the application of LCA in the building process and
   therefore gives incentives for companies to apply it. Moreover, the
   re-work caused by the need for re-entering data and the usage of many
   different software tools that characterize most of the current LCA
   practices is minimized. Furthermore, decision-making, both at the

Abstract = {Decarbonization is essential to meeting urgent climate goals. With the
   building sector in the United States accounting for 35\% of total U.S.
   carbon emissions, reducing environmental impacts within the built
   environment is critical. Whole-building life cycle analysis (WBLCA)
   quantifies the impacts of a building throughout its life cycle. Despite
   being a powerful tool, WBLCA is not standard practice in the integrated
   design process. When WBLCA is used, it is typically either speculative
   and based on early design information or conducted only after design
   completion as an accounting measure, with virtually no opportunity to
   impact the actual design. This work proposes a workflow for fully
   incorporating WBLCA into the building design process in an iterative,
   recursive manner, where design decisions impact the WBLCA, which in turn
   informs future design decisions. We use the example of a
   negative-operational carbon modular building seeking negative upfront
   embodied carbon using bio-based materials for carbon sequestration as a
   case study for demonstrating the utility of the framework. Key
   contributions of this work include a framework of computational
   processes for conducting iterative WBLCA, using a combination of an
   existing building WBLCA tool (Tally) within the building information
   modeling superstructure (Revit) and a custom script (in R) for
   materials, life cycle stages, and workflows not available in the WBLCA
   tool. Additionally, we provide strategies for harmonizing the
   environmental impacts of novel materials or processes from various life
   cycle inventory sources with materials or processes in existing building
   WBLCA tool repositories. These strategies are useful for those involved
   in building design with an interest in reducing their environmental
   impact. For example, this framework would be useful for researchers who
   are conducting WBLCAs on projects that include new or unusual materials
   and for design teams who want to integrate WBLCA more fully into their
   design process in order to ensure the building materials are consciously
   chosen to advance climate goals, while still ensuring best performance
   by traditional measures.},

Title = {Developing a Methodology for Integration of Whole Life Costs into BIM
   Processes to Assist Design Decision Making},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A common barrier to achieving design intent is the absence of
   comprehensive information about operational performance during design
   development. This results in uninformed decision-making which impacts on
   actual building performance, in particular Whole Life Costs (WLC). It is
   proposed that Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to
   facilitate a more comprehensive and accurate design approach from the
   initial stages if the model can utilize reliable and robust cost and
   performance data from buildings in use. This paper describes the initial
   findings of a research project that has investigated the integration of
   WLC estimation into BIM processes. The study focusses specifically on
   the rapidly emerging Private Rental Sector (PRS) as the build-to-rent
   market has repeatable tasks and similar workflow patterns, roles and
   responsibilities, but impacts of WLC can significantly influence the
   business model. The study adopted a mixed method approach for the
   development and validation of a structured standardized process for
   timely WLC estimation through BIM. The research identified a number of
   barriers. These included varying definitions of WLC calculation
   methodologies; the availability and standards of data sources, in
   particular, the misalignment of coding systems for identification and
   classification of components at various levels of development,
   proprietary ownership of data, lack of knowledge and skills in team
   members to produce and/or utilize data sources, and limitations of
   software. However, the research proposes that these may be addressed by
   a reverse-engineered systematic process that uses the Integrated
   DEFinition (IDEF) 3 structured diagramming modelling technique that can
   be incorporated into a software model and has developed a model for a
   systematic approach for BIM-enabled WLC assessment based on CE
   principles which would include access to live data streams from
   completed buildings. The paper describes this model development which
   has the potential to enhance BIM lifecycle management through an
   augmented decision-making approach that is integral to the natural
   design development process.},

Title = {Integration of LCA and LCC analysis within a BIM-based environment},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a growing concern in society for the environmental impacts of a
   built environment. In this regard, the use of building information
   modelling (BIM) tools has arisen as a new trend in the construction
   industry to improve the sustainable assessments of buildings in the
   design phase. For that purpose, current approaches either focus on the
   use of BIM together with several programs, or solely use it for an
   automatic quantity take-off. However, as noted in the literature, the
   lack of semantic information within BIM models can lead to ineffective
   decision-making processes and models that are unsuitable for the
   operation and maintenance stages. Therefore, the present study explores
   the potential of BIM as a repository for the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   and life cycle costing (LCC) information, and how that information
   should be used for an environmental and economic analysis. By doing so,
   the authors intend to discuss the potential of BIM as a data repository
   and its capacity for supporting an automatic/semi-automatic
   environmental and economic assessment.
   A BIM-LCA/LCC framework was proposed, which led to the development of an
   information delivery manual and a model view definition (IDM/MVD), using
   the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, for the integration and
   exchange of information within a BIM-based environment. Finally, the
   authors implemented the proposed framework with a case study. It is
   observed that, although most recent IFC schemes already consider some of
   the required information, a considerable number of properties are still
   required to conduct a comprehensive LCA and LCC analysis. Thus, the work
   presented here contributes to the existing background knowledge
   necessary for future implementations of BIM-based LCA/LCC and for
   software developers to develop a suitable BIM-LCA/LCC tool.},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {221},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) helps simplify data acquisition and
   reduce labor-intensive processes in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of
   buildings. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of
   integrating BIM into LCA. This paper aims to develop a framework for
   systematically reviewing the body of knowledge on BIMintegrated LCA in
   the concept, methodology, and value dimensions. Following the framework,
   this paper analyzes case studies involving 82 buildings from selected
   publications between 2011 and 2021, using scientometric and detailed
   content analysis techniques. The results evidence that the majority of
   them were studies of residential, low-rise, and concrete buildings and
   used Autodesk Revit for establishing BIM models. Three types of methods
   for BIM-integrated LCA were identified: integrating data into a
   third-party application or tool (I), importing a bill of quantities
   report generated from the BIM model into a dedicated LCA tool (II), and
   using plugins with LCA data for BIM software (III). However,
   interoperability between BIM and LCA remains a serious challenge owing
   to different terminologies and data structures. Hence, two means have
   been suggested to improve this: adapting the BIM data to the LCA data
   structure and developing a simpler BIM tool. This paper provides a
   theoretical foundation for better understanding ``what BIM-integrated
   LCA is{''}, ``how to integrate BIM with LCA to simplify and automate
   data input{''}, and ``what applications of BIM-integrated LCA are{''}.
   It also serves as an information base for researchers and software
   developers to identify the contemporary research trends and knowledge
   gaps in this discipline.},

Abstract = {In the early building design stage, there are numerous uncertainties due
   to the lack of information on materials and processes. Designers
   therefore cannot quantify the environmental impacts of buildings in
   order to evaluate the environmental performance of their designs early
   on. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) and building information
   modeling (BIM) are carried out in the early and detailed building design
   stages. The method is applied to a residential building in Quebec,
   Canada. The BIM is conducted with Revit, and the LCA with openLCA. To
   prepare the Revit outputs as the appropriate inputs of the LCA model, a
   functional database was developed. It includes all building assemblies,
   layers and possible materials commonly found in residential buildings in
   Quebec. The ecoinvent database was used to source of life cycle
   inventory (LCI) data for each material. To manage information
   uncertainty in the early design stage, a probability function was
   assigned to each material. At the detailed design stage, all material
   types and quantities were specified in BIM file, which was used in the
   LCA study. The environmental impacts of the building stages and
   assemblies were calculated to determine the best building assembly
   options from an environmental perspective-a process that could guide
   building designers in the environmental assessments of their designs,
   making it possible to select more sustainable materials for each
   assembly and thus reduce the environmental impacts of the building.},

Abstract = {The building sector contributes to 50.9 percent of China's carbon
   emissions. Due to the complexity of the assessment process, it is
   difficult to predict the entire life cycle carbon emissions of a
   building at the early stage of design. In this study, a whole-life
   carbon emission estimation model for the early stage of building design
   is developed based on comparison of the standard calculations and an
   analysis of stock cases. Firstly, the standard calculation methods in
   China, Japan and Europe were compared, and the boundary of the model was
   defined in three parts: production, construction and demolition and
   operation. Second, information on 68 examples of Chinese buildings was
   collected and divided into a training set and a test set at a ratio of
   7:3. In the training set, the relationship between carbon emissions and
   the design parameters was searched, and a carbon emission estimation
   model applicable to different stages was constructed. Finally, the model
   was applied to the test set for validation. The results show that the
   calculation error of the model is within +/- 15\%, and it can quickly
   estimate carbon emissions based on the design factors, which is helpful
   for carbon emission assessment work in the early stages of design.},

Abstract = {Building envelopes and regional conditions can significantly contribute
   to the cost and energy performance of the buildings. Structured methods
   that take into account the impacts of both the envelope materials and
   the regional conditions to find the most feasible envelope materials
   within a region, however, are still missing. This study responds to this
   need by proposing a novel method using the capabilities of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM). The proposed method is used for identifying
   cost-and energy-efficient building envelope materials within a region
   over the life cycle. First, commonly used envelope materials in a region
   are identified. Then, BIM is employed for simulating the energy
   performance and evaluating the life cycle cost of the materials. The
   method was implemented in Tehran, Iran. It was successfully utilized for
   improving the cost and energy performance of a nine-story residential
   building case. The achieved results indicated a potential energy
   performance enhancement of 31\%, and the life cycle cost improvement of
   28\% by replacing conventionally used envelope materials with the
   available high-performance building materials. The proposed method can
   benefit various stakeholders in the building construction industry,
   including municipalities, owners, contractors, and consumers, by
   enhancing the cost and energy performance of the buildings.},

Abstract = {Future-proofing (FP) as a proactive initiative for asset management is
   an urgent need against uncertainty, particularly in health care due to
   unforeseeable demographic shifts and rapid advances in medical
   technology. Building information modelling (BIM) is a data-driven
   initiative, but a rigorous analysis between them will indicate that a
   synergy exists. The aim of this study is to develop a classification
   ontology of the interactions between FP and BIM by considering the
   perceptions of health care construction experts. Interviews with 13
   senior managers were conducted adopting the method of interpretative
   phenomenological analysis and an interaction matrix of BIM capabilities
   for implementing holistic FP objectives has been developed. The outcome
   is a taxonomy analysis of 30 interactions with supporting empirical
   evidence which was further measured quantitatively. For benefits
   realization in the context of BIM and FP, the industry experts recognize
   FP as a strategy that supports organizational and building performance.
   BIM drives towards life cycle operation information and data
   main-tainability via communicating the FP strategy from a whole-life
   perspective and ensuring knowledge transfer across all stages. Health
   care Operators and construction experts should be able to benefit from
   this taxonomy analysis as an aid to planning for FP throughout their BIM

   Sustainability Assessment method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The built environment is significantly responsible for the current
   climate crisis, thus developing more sustainable projects is becoming an
   urgent objective. One widely recognized method that supports achieving
   this objective is the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), which
   enables a holistic, quantitative evaluation of building sustainability,
   including environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The
   integration of this method in digital design tools such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) facilitates its use during the building
   design stages. However, data granularity is not the same in every design
   stage, and consequently data consistency cannot be assured. Hence, the
   margin of unexpected variation of the results shall be avoided and
   robust results from the early design stages should be obtained. During
   the early stage, the level of details is generally limited to the
   element definition, while during the detailed stages, the volume of
   information regarding the building increased. This paper aims to fill in
   the informational gaps during the early design stage and align those
   results with a detailed data structure developed for cost estimation
   during the detailed stages. Thus, based on a case study analysis, we can
   demonstrate the consistency of the method by determining the variation
   of material quantities and comparing the LCSA inventory indicators
   during the early and detailed stages. This method can estimate more than
   60\% of the LCSA inventory indicators during the early design stage and
   the total results during detailed design stage.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a suitable method to analyse and improve
   the environmental impact of buildings. However, it is complex to apply
   in the design phase. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can help to
   perform LCA during the design process. Current BIM-LCA approaches follow
   two trends. Either they use complex models in detailed design phases,
   when it is late for major changes, or they are based on simplified
   approaches only applicable in early design stages. This paper proposes a
   novel method for applying LCA continuously over the entire building
   design process to assess the embodied environmental impacts by using the
   data provided by BIM with as much accuracy as possible in each stage.
   The method uses different LCA databases with different levels of detail
   for the specific level of development (LOD) of the BIM. Since different
   building elements are not modelled with identical LODs in each design
   phase, the assessment of embodied environmental impacts is conducted by
   consistently mixing the LCA databases, which is possible as long as the
   databases use identical background data. The method is applied to five
   design stages of a building case study. The results show that it is now
   possible to calculate the embodied impacts in all design stages while
   being consistent with the results from the completed project. The
   environmental impact in a certain design phase is always within the
   range of variability of the previous phase. Therefore, the method allows
   to estimate the final embodied environmental impact with increasing
   accuracy and by that provide information for decision-making throughout
   the whole design process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Around the world, global warming and energy consumption in the building
   had become the most important reasons to have directed the world's
   attention to energy-efficient building. Building sectors have increased
   parallel with the urbanization expansion in the developed countries,
   which increases the energy demand use in the building. External
   parameters and internal building components have a significant impact on
   the enhanced energy performance of the building. The use of energy
   assessment tools along with building information modeling could provide
   an effective contribution to support decision-making in the early design
   stages. This will enable a selection for proper building components and
   materials as well as minimize the influence on the overall energy
   consumption of buildings. This case study examines an education building
   located in the city of Alexandria (Egypt). The examine include life
   cycle electricity, fuel use, and life cycle energy cost along with the
   annual energy use intensity and annual peak demand considering
   four-building parameters (Orientation, Wall, Roof, HVAC) have been
   evaluated and compared with the initial design. This work enables
   stakeholders to have a previous virtual imagination to whole building

   construction. Digital twin constructs a complete virtual space mapping
   model by using the historical operation data and sensor data update of
   the physical model, so as to reflect the whole life-cycle process of the
   physical system. In the design stage, digital twin technology can
   simulate the development of the whole life cycle and feedback the data
   to the designers to help to decide the building performance under
   different parameters. In the construction stage, digital twin technology
   can reflect the problems in the construction, reduce the construction
   difficulty and improve the construction quality. In the operation and
   maintenance stage, more variable data are collected to reflect the
   internal state of the building. With the support of these data, the
   building condition will be analyzed and diagnosed more accurately, and
   the maintenance is simpler and more efficient. The application of
   digital twin will effectively solve the problem of low degree of
   digitization intelligence in the current process of design and
   construction integration.},

Abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings is a very important issue, where the
   operational demand is considered to be one of the highest amongst all
   other sectors of an economy. Moving towards energy efficient buildings
   is a key factor to achieve sustainability. A novel framework for
   integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modeling,
   and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency of
   the resulting building designs adopted, along with reducing the
   difficulties associated with the construction of the building, in terms
   of cost of construction, is developed. The framework accommodates
   various parameters, via integrating mathematical optimization
   programming, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to
   improve the building performance, identify alternative sustainable
   designs, and empower the decision-making process and sustainability in
   the construction sector. Through the developed optimization model, the
   examination of various alternatives for building components that make up
   the envelope of a residential building is undertaken. Insights gained
   from the results show that all components of building envelopes
   influence the energy consumption in buildings, particularly, exterior
   walls and windows. Impacts in terms of annual energy use intensity can
   be reduced by about 45\%, life cycle energy use and cost can be enhanced
   by more than 50\%, and environmental impacts such as acidification and
   global warming potential can be reduced by more than 30\%, due to use of
   the proposed framework. This work indicates that sustainable building
   decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and
   assessment of environmental impact via Building Information Modeling and
   life cycle assessment.},

Abstract = {The significance of environmental management of existing buildings in
   reducing the environmental impact of the construction sector is
   increasingly emphasized. However, life-cycle assessment (LCA) to
   evaluate a building's environmental burden requires considerable time
   and costs for the collection and interpretation of data needed for
   analysis. Therefore, this study proposed an integrated assessment
   framework of economic, environmental, and human health impacts using
   scan-to-building information modeling (BIM) and LCA in existing
   buildings. To verify the proposed framework, a case study was conducted.
   A BIM model with an error rate of 1.442\% can be automatically generated
   from the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud using parametric algorithm.
   The total cost for the target case was calculated at USD 162,769, and
   the environmental cost accounted for the largest percentage at 97.15\%.
   The developed framework in this study holds significance because it
   enables the automated assessment of economic, environmental, and human
   health impacts of existing buildings through the integration of BIM and
   LCA.},

   applications of BIM, the integration of related technologies and the
   tendencies and challenges systematically. Design/methodology/approach
   Using quantitative and qualitative bibliometric statistical methods, the
   current mode of interaction between BIM and other related technologies
   is summarized. Findings This paper identified 24 different BIM
   applications in the life cycle. From two perspectives, the
   implementation status of BIM applications and integrated technologies
   are respectively studied. The future industry development framework is
   drawn comprehensively. We summarized the challenges of BIM applications
   from the perspectives of management, technology and promotion, and
   confirmed that most of the challenges come from the two driving factors
   of promotion and management. Research limitations/implications The
   technical challenges reviewed in this paper are from the collected
   literature we have extracted, which is only a part of the practical
   challenges and not comprehensive enough. Practical implications We
   summarized the current mode of interactive use of BIM and sorted out the
   challenges faced by BIM applications to provide reference for the risks
   and challenges faced by the future industry. Originality/value There is
   little literature to integrate BIM applications and to establish BIM
   related challenges and risk frameworks. In this paper, we provide a
   review of the current implementation level of BIM and the risks and
   challenges of stakeholders through three aspects of management,
   technology and promotion.},

Abstract = {The AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations)
   industry has raised a good deal of interest surrounding the use of BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) for project life cycle information
   management. Ideally the new development of BIM should make a full
   knowledge sharing between the facility management and design
   professionals unprecedentedly possible. But in reality different
   stakeholders of AECO projects are still working in their own silos and
   are afraid to collaborate with each other. This paper aims to identify
   the root causes of the ``information disintegration{''} issue in the
   AECO industry, which describes the lack of consolidation, unification
   and integration of building information over the project lifecycle and
   across different stakeholders. The options of bridging the knowledge gap
   between the design, construction, and operation phases by BIM have been
   investigated, as well as the need for data integration for facility
   management purposes. An in-depth case study is proposed to identify
   current problems pertaining to BIM utilization in facility management,
   in the areas of business processes, stakeholder perceptions and
   behaviors, and technologies.},

Abstract = {This work integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA), and presents the outcome of this integration in
   evaluating environmental impacts of building materials in the
   construction sector. A case study of a multi-story office building is
   applied to validate the development of design concepts and discuss the
   results generated by BIM and LCA tools. This research evaluates the LCA
   methodology of the case study based on ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines
   within the available database, using Autodesk Revit as a BIM program and
   Green Building Studio and Tally applications in Revit as tools to
   achieve the objectives. This study indicates that BIM-LCA integration is
   an optimal procedure towards achieving sustainable development and
   environmental protection, and empowers the decision-making process in
   the construction sector. It sheds light on the current limitations that
   are facing the integration process. Moreover, this work outlines that
   most of the negative environmental impacts are occurring during the
   manufacturing and operation phases. Thus, it encourages reviewing the
   application of building materials in order to reduce the passive

Abstract = {``U-Business{''} is a novel type business environment, which can provide
   various services via many mobile devices. In order to provide
   personalized service to different users, user model (UM) can play an
   important role in U-Business. UM reflects some characteristics of users
   to a certain degree, which is used widely in U-Business, like
   personalized recommendation, social computing, information retrieval
   services, and so on. Currently, there are more and more researchers who
   focus on the building and update of UM based on the activities of
   people. However, as too many UM appeared, the number of UM in cyber
   space is increasingly large, which takes a lot of space and cost.
   Furthermore, after some users disappear in the physic world, their
   models are still working in the cyber world. This case is not reasonable
   obviously, but few researches take care about it. Therefore, one of
   important issues, the death of UM should be taken into account in the
   whole life-cycle of user model. This paper proposes a specific user
   modeling method for the Cyber Individuals (Cyber-I) in U-Business. The
   essential difference between this UM and traditional ones is that it has
   a life, that is, birth, growth, and demise, like a life-cycle of
   Cyber-I. Specially, the significance of UM life ending and five states
   of UM death are described from an organic viewpoint. In addition, there
   is a framework of the whole life process of UM. Finally, the proposed
   idea is applied to the field of personalized service.},

Title = {Developing an automated BIM-based life cycle assessment approach for
   modularly designed high-rise buildings},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {90},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modular construction has attracted increasing attention due to its
   energy and environmental benefits. Digital technologies such as building
   information modelling (BIM) have also been explored to generate and
   manage data through the lifecycle of buildings. Although research has
   been performed in the area of integrating BIM and modular construction,
   BIM-based automated lifecycle assessment (LCA) of prefabricated
   buildings remains unexplored. This study therefore aims to develop a
   BIM-based LCA method for prefabricated buildings incorporating different
   assessment levels with unique system boundaries and functional units.
   The developed approach can support automated assessments through all
   lifecycle phases of a prefabricated building. It is achieved through an
   automated process of creating parameters to merge LCA data into the
   building model, systematic zoning, model setup and impact estimation.
   This approach is applied to evaluate the energy and environmental
   performances of a case building in Hong Kong. The case study validated
   the efficiency of the developed BIMbased LCA method in providing a
   systematic and detailed assessment of modularly designed buildings. This
   study extends the knowledge in automated BIM-based LCA by addressing
   specific characteristics of prefabrication and promotes the
   incorporation of comprehensive and detailed LCA data into BIM models for
   improved design robustness and holistic performances of buildings. This
   validated approach will enhance the willingness of designers to apply
   LCA during the design stages for minimizing the energy and environmental
   impacts of both new and renovated buildings with prefabrication.},

Abstract = {This study is to integrate the application of BIM used in different
   stages of project management. In the early design stage, BIM helps
   decision-making, costing budget, and information sharing, which benefit
   the following stages most. On the next construction stage, BIM has
   played an important role in assisting the project's construction
   process, avoiding construction risks, quality management, and components
   prefabrication and virtual assembly. When it comes to the later
   operation stage, BIM has numerous advantages: facility maintenance
   management, energy, and emergence management, change and relocation
   management, and safety management. However, there are still some
   limitations of BIM that are used in different stages of project
   management. The barriers of technical, personnel, and cost will have
   some adverse effects on BIM use. Therefore, BIM has played important
   role in the project management life cycle.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a short technical perspective on how Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) could support the immediate implementation
   of the recently announced Critical Raw Materials (CRM) Act that will
   ensure EU access to a secure and sustainable supply of CRMs towards
   meeting Europe's 2030 climate and digital objectives. By leveraging the
   digitalisation offered in the construction sector via the use of BIM, it
   will be possible to effectively monitor the use of CRMs in a BIM-enabled
   construction project. BIM covers the entire life cycle of a building,
   including the monitoring of quantities and related processes of CRMs.
   This extends from preparatory and construction phases to maintenance,
   demolition, and end-of-life stages. Extending further, and towards
   monitoring in a more holistic approach the material and waste journey
   before or after the BIM coverage, the integration of a Life Cycle
   Assessment could cover the entire CRM journey in the construction sector
   and beyond (mining, manufacturing, recycling, etc.). This direct access
   to information will allow for (i) a better understanding of the use of
   CRMs in the construction sector, (ii) improved material management and
   collection of critical raw material-rich waste, (iii) more informed
   decision-making across all involved actors, and (iv) evidence-based
   policy-making regarding primary and secondary CRMs in the construction
   sector and beyond.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {There is a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   attributed to the built environment, either for production or the
   operation of buildings. Various initiatives are being implemented to
   reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the
   evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and
   removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings
   should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are
   effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades
   and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change
   significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the
   design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound
   life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage.
   A straightforward method that can be applied for a detailed
   understanding of the effects of climate change and prospective
   electricity grid mix on building energy use is presented. The novelty of
   this study was to integrate long-term energy projections in a high
   temporal resolution LCA for buildings and taking into account different
   future climates and prospective electricity mixes across Canada. The
   research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a
   Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate
   and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific
   robustness of LCA metrics. The proposed methodology will assist users to
   apply a clear framework that helps to define an optimized design
   alternative through a dynamic energy analysis and future weather
   forecasting simulation. An example of an actual office building is
   provided to demonstrate the capabilities and usefulness of the developed
   integrated framework.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of a prefabricated house for seven locations in
   different climates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings use lighter materials and have lower embodied
   impacts than conventional buildings. Previous studies assessed mainly
   energy and carbon, or a specific life cycle stage. However, increased
   operational energy can compromise the lower embodied impacts of
   lightweight prefabricated buildings, so a comprehensive life cycle
   assessment is required. This article assessed a lightweight
   prefabricated house for seven house locations (addressing transport,
   climate, and electricity mix), three insulation levels, and two heat
   pumps. A life cycle model was developed for a prefabricated one-bedroom
   house with a steel structure, addressing materials, transport to plant,
   modular prefabrication, transport to site, onsite assemblage, and use
   stage. A building information model (BIM) was integrated with the life
   cycle model to obtain the bill of materials, perform the energy
   simulation, and build the life cycle inventory. This comprehensive
   assessment includes abiotic resource depletion, abiotic depletion of
   fossil fuels, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical
   oxidation, acidification, eutrophication, and nonrenewable energy
   categories. Results show that embodied impacts for the Mediterranean and
   tropical climates are significant (up to 60\%) for most impact
   categories. Prefabricated buildings should have different insulation
   levels: low level in a tropical climate, medium level in the
   Mediterranean, and high level in the EU continental region. Lightweight
   prefabricated buildings use fewer materials and can have lower embodied
   and operational impacts than heavyweight conventional, thus reducing the
   overall life cycle impacts of the building sector.},

   Inpatient Building: A Case Study in China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings provide healthcare services at the costs of
   significant amounts of energy consumption and carbon emissions, further
   exacerbating the environmental load. Because of the limited research on
   the life cycle carbon emissions of Chinese hospitals, this study
   conducted a detailed carbon-accounting and comparative study. Firstly,
   BIM and LCA were used to quantify the carbon emissions of the inpatient
   building in each stage of the life cycle. Secondly, the differences in
   carbon emissions by stage were compared on the basis of 20 cases of
   public buildings. The results show that the whole-life carbon emissions
   of the inpatient building was 10,459.94 kgCO2/m2. The proportion of
   operational carbon emissions was 94.68\%, with HVAC (52.57\%), equipment
   (27.85\%), and lighting (10.11\%) being the main sources. Embodied
   carbon emissions accounted for 4.54\%, and HRB400 steel and C30 concrete
   were the main sources of carbon emissions. Hospitals are second only to
   emporiums in terms of operational carbon intensity, being 1.71 and 1.41
   times that of schools and office buildings, with inpatient buildings
   being 3 and 1.7 times that of medical complexes and outpatient
   buildings, respectively. The future sustainable development of hospital
   buildings should promote efficient building performance and good
   environmental quality, both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon
   reduction.},

Abstract = {In today's construction industry, a topic of paramount importance is
   reducing energy consumption within buildings. This study endeavors to
   combine Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to enhance the
   environmental efficiency of buildings. The core objective is the
   optimization of materials used in the building's outer shell to
   effectively curtail operational energy consumption. To achieve this, we
   employed BIM modeling, parametric simulations with the Energy Plus
   engine, and Athena to assess the embodied energy in materials. The
   multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGAII was harnessed to determine
   the most suitable materials. The results derived from the LCA and BIM
   analyses illustrate that the selection of optimal materials for
   residential building facades in Iran can lead to a remarkable 40\%
   reduction in annual average energy consumption. Furthermore, this
   approach contributes significantly to mitigating global warming
   potential (GWP). Experts and architects can apply this method to
   evaluate and select the best materials for various building components,
   especially in high-rise buildings.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework that integrates Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) with Genetic Algorithm Optimization and Monte-Carlo
   Simulation. The developed framework helps in implementing a stochastic
   Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) model for building to select the optimum building

   in each cost element starting from initial cost to end on life cost.
   Genetic Algorithms Optimization technique is utilized to select the
   optimum alternatives of building systems taking in consideration
   sustainability aspects. The Monte-Carlo Simulation model is used as a
   fitness function for the optimization model. The environmental aspect of
   building is achieved by considering the maximum number of points that
   can be awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
   (LEED) rating system. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the optimum
   solutions that are chosen by optimization a model to examine the effect
   of different building systems on LCC and its components through
   computing the rank order of building systems and the target output. A
   case study is presented to demonstrate the practical features of the
   proposed framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {In situ modeling methodologies in building operation: A review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {230},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The building information and operational data generated during the
   building life cycle are essential for realizing energy-efficient
   operation, indoor environmental quality, and digitalization in the
   context of intelligent buildings. At the city scale, building operation
   information is necessary to evaluate and improve energy efficiency to
   achieve carbon neutrality in the building sector. When considering
   long-term operation over the building life cycle with the basic modeling
   environments available during the design stage, conventional modeling
   approaches for building informatization and digitalization provide
   limited reliability and availability owing to different building
   designs, gaps between design and operation, aging-related changes, and
   experimental issues. These challenges require an in situ modeling
   perspective throughout the building life cycle. Therefore, based on the
   literature reviews, this paper proposes and discusses in situ modeling
   methodologies for building operations according to six aspects: modeling
   environment, model purpose, model source, modeling approach, in situ
   verification, and in situ calibration. They are mainly discussed by two
   modeling environments including (1) in situ modeling with the model
   observations and (2) onsite modeling without the observations. Practical
   challenges for in situ modeling are discussed. Various in situ modeling
   scenarios and strategies are then suggested, and in situ model fusion is
   proposed to overcome the limitations of extant building operation
   modeling environments. Future research directions are proposed to
   facilitate continuous information modeling and digitalization of
   operations throughout the building life cycle.},

Abstract = {Today, building information modelling (BIM) plays a crucial role in the
   research and development fields of construction information integration
   and interoperability. This paper, from an information technology point
   of view, outlines the definition and aims of the ``3D to nD

   Engineering and Physics Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). It presents a
   scenario of widening BIM implementation into the overall aspects
   involved in the whole life cycle of a building project. Industry
   foundation classes (IFC) as a standard BIM specification has been
   adopted as a central information repository in order to deliver the
   integrated building information throughout the nD-driven assessments,
   evaluation and decision-making. This paper also focuses on the
   development of an IFC-viewer, which is defined as the holistic interface
   of the nD modelling tool. The techniques and methods including the
   auxiliary tools adopted in this development are detailed. This
   development presents a practical and economic way to reveal and retrieve
   the information of IFC models inclusively, structurally and visually.

Abstract = {In an integrated project, the main decisions are evaluated by the
   project team in the conceptual phase. With the large volume of
   information needed to carry out a project in the civil construction
   industry, the demand for more rational and better performing processes
   is growing. As a strategic role, the BIM model combined with the Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) help in the selection of materials and
   construction techniques for more sustainable projects. The analyzes
   generated make it possible for companies and architectural design
   offices to decide which strategies to adopt to reduce environmental
   impacts. There is a wide variety of software available on the market to
   assist in these studies. This article presents an overview of Brazilian
   scientific productions, within the range of 2010 to 2017, that use
   environmental analysis linked to BIM. It analyzes the evolutionary
   profile of the scientific production of simulations and the exchange
   between the exchange of information to arrive at environmental analyses.
   It was possible to conclude that BIM+LCA simulations and information
   exchange between applications and users require detailed planning and
   fundamental modifications in the design process. Another point noted is
   that, in Brazil, there is no information generated by national databases
   for a complete LCA, which is fundamental in decision-making during the
   life cycle of the building.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) and the digital exchange of
   information in the construction industry is growing rapidly. Objects and
   their information are being exchanged in the supply chain and the
   lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur. Information is
   defined and interpreted differently by the different parties. Automated
   exchange of information in the industry is therefore not possible. The
   Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide national cooperation
   between partners in the total building sector, have set the ambition to
   create a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL): ``one language for the building
   sector{''}. Based on the concept of ``distributed libraries{''}, the
   library will be tuned to other international and national libraries and
   classification systems. Creating this common language in a combined
   national effort will be beneficial for all partners: More efficient
   exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire
   supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer's
   design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures
   arising from misinterpretation. This paper describes the principles of
   the CB-NL and how this will help to make BIM-models for the life cycle
   of the build environment.},

Title = {Uncertainty Analysis of Life Cycle Energy Assessment in Early Stages of
   Design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {208},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {During building design and especially in early stages, important
   decisions influencing the lifecycle-based energy demand of buildings are
   made. Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) is used to evaluate this
   energy demand already in early stages of design. However, at that point,
   the building design and the related information can quickly change and
   are subject to potentially large uncertainty. This uncertainty in
   building information influences the LCEA and therefore decisions taken
   by the designer. Due to the uncertainty, it is difficult to distinguish
   between the performance of different design variants to decide for the
   best option. This study presents a method to perform LCEA and to assess
   and consequently strategically reduce the influence of uncertainties in
   buildings' information on the LCEA in early design stages. Uncertainty
   analysis is used to assess the influence of uncertainty on LCEA and to
   prioritize decisions to reduce uncertainty. The method is embedded in a
   multi-Level of Development (LOD) modelling approach covering the
   development of the building during the early stages of design. The
   method is applied to seven different building shapes as a proof of
   concept. It is concluded that the method renders valid results to assess
   the project-specific uncertainty in LCEA results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Life cycle energy analysis of buildings: A systematic review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {252},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Buildings consume a significant amount of energy and resources during
   all stages of their life cycle, causing enormous environmental impacts.
   Life cycle energy analysis is a holistic approach to estimating the
   energy performance of buildings with respect to their designed energy
   efficiency. This paper aims to ascertain the state of research on the
   life cycle energy analysis of buildings to formulate a strategic
   framework for reducing the energy footprint of the building sector. The
   study is conducted through the explorative method of research using a
   systematic review approach. The material for the systematic review is
   selected from five scientific databases through a rigorous and
   structured process. Findings indicate that the current methods of life
   cycle energy estimation are tedious and resource-intensive, requiring
   numerous, incomplete inventory databases and energy simulation tools
   that require a user interface. Moreover, the lack of explicit guidelines
   or standards for life cycle energy estimation causes large variations in
   the results, thus making the comparison between different studies
   unrealistic. Further, recent trends reveal the use of methods such as

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM), as an effective means to improve
   the efficiency of building design and construction, is gradually
   receiving widespread attention. However, in the railway industry, BIM is
   still in its infancy in terms of infrastructure data transmission, and
   has not yet formed a general data exchange mode that can fully meet the
   full life-cycle data transmission needs of railway infrastructure.
   According to the requirement of data sharing in the full life-cycle of
   railway infrastructure, this paper proposes a railway infrastructure
   data exchange model. By referring to the data modeling methods of
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Railway Markup Language (RailML),
   this paper proposes a metadata definition method of railway
   infrastructure and a method of automatically generating data exchange
   schema based on the data exchange model. Application results show that
   the proposed data exchange schema can provide an efficient and
   convenient way for data sharing in the full life-cycle of railway
   infrastructure.},

Title = {Research on carbon emissions during the construction process of
   prefabricated buildings based on BIM and LCA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 27},
Abstract = {The goal of double carbon reflects the new goals and requirements of
   China's entry into a new development stage. In this regard, the
   construction industry, as a large producer of carbon emissions, should
   focus on emission reduction. In the whole life cycle of buildings, the
   carbon emission intensity in the physicochemical stage is the largest,
   so we should focus on the carbon emission in the physicochemical stage.
   Compared with the cast-in-situ concrete floor slab, the bidirectional
   prestressed precast hollow slab (BPPHS) has the characteristics of
   environment-friendly under the condition of meeting the building stress,
   and the manufacturing process of precast floor slab is more
   standardized, which can give full play to the performance of components.
   Based on BIM (Building Information Modeling) and LCA (Life Cycle
   Assessment) theory, and in the case of tram transportation, this paper
   studies the carbon emission of prefabricated hollow floor slab used in
   prefabricated buildings in the building stage. The research shows that
   the use of BPPHS reduces the carbon emission of 197,332.81 kg in the
   whole physicochemical stage, and the emission reduction rate is 46.52\%
   compared with the cast-in-place slab. Compared with the ordinary
   prefabricated laminated plate, the emission reduction rate reaches
   45.40\%; The carbon emission sources in the materialization stage of
   prefabricated buildings are divided into production stage,
   transportation stage and construction stage. The carbon emission
   reduction in each stage accounts for 42.29\%, 46.18\% and 51.08\%,
   respectively, in each stage of cast-in-situ floor slab. Compared with
   ordinary precast slab, the emission reduction rates of each stage are
   34.67\%, 53.60\% and 47.84\%, respectively. The emission reduction
   potential of BPPHS is very considerable. It can not only promote the
   development of prefabricated buildings but also have lower carbon than
   conventional precast slab. The study provides new ideas for reducing
   building carbon emissions, which will also provide reference for
   industry entrepreneurs and relevant governments to realize low-carbon
   economy and sustainable development.},

Title = {Utilization of an Automatic Tool for Building Material Selection by
   Integrating Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in the Early Design
   Stages in BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent international scientific studies have described the current
   situation regarding CO2 emissions and have provided evidence of its
   catastrophic short- and medium-term consequences. The implementation of
   solutions of a more sustainable nature to reduce and mitigate this
   situation is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, the integration
   of multi-dimension and life cycle assessment into the design process of
   buildings can help and support decision making. Life Cycle
   Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is one of the scientific community's
   most widely recognized methodologies for this purpose, combining the
   evaluation of the social, economic, and social dimensions (Triple Bottom
   Line). One of the main obstacles to implementing this methodology lies
   in the difficulties in automatically comparing alternative design
   options for the selection of different materials. To overcome this
   limitation, the authors developed the BIM3LCA (Building Information
   Modelling Three Life Cycle Assessment) tool conceived to guide the
   decision-making process during the early design steps. This study
   introduces a Building Information Modelling (BIM) plug-in development
   and validates its application in a case study to support the
   multi-criteria building material selection based on the LCSA
   implementation at the early design stage. Three building material
   alternatives for the structural system of a multi-family residential
   building are employed to validate this plug-in. The results show the
   viability of using this tool during the early design stages and
   demonstrates the consistency of the results regarding the use of the BIM
   model to conduct the LCSA. The study discusses the benefits and
   limitations of the BIM3LCA tool. This research contributes towards the
   integration of multi-dimension real-time assessment in the building
   design process by using semantically rich BIM models.},

Title = {A science-based approach to setting climate targets for buildings: The
   case of a New Zealand detached house},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Climate change mitigation requires the construction of low-carbon
   buildings. The use of Life Cycle Assessment provides useful information
   to support eco-efficiency improvements and therefore, to reduce the
   climate impact of buildings. However, it does not ascertain whether a
   proposed design aligns with achieving the global climate target of
   limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. This
   study, therefore, introduces a science-based approach for setting
   climate targets for individual buildings using a whole-of-life cycle
   perspective. It involves assigning a share of the 2 degrees C global
   carbon budget for 2018-2050 to a country, its construction sector, and
   finally to each life cycle stage of a building. A stock projection model
   is used to account for the projected growth in the number of buildings
   and associated climate impact in a country up to 2050. The approach was
   applied to define a climate target for a New Zealand new-built detached
   house of 198 m(2) gross floor area, the most common residential building
   type in the country. The weighted average climate impact of three New
   Zealand new-built detached houses was compared with the defined climate
   target. The results showed that the climate impact of new-built detached
   housing exceeded the climate target by a factor of five. When the
   climate impact was compared with the climate targets at each life cycle
   stage, exceedances were a factor three to five higher across the
   different life cycle stages. The proposed approach has potential to
   guide designers and other interested stakeholders to operate the
   construction sector within planetary boundaries.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The climate debate necessitates reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
   buildings. A common and standardized method of assessing this is life
   cycles assessment (LCA); however, time and costs are a barrier. Large
   efficiency potentials are associated with using data from building
   information models (BIM) for the LCA, but development is still at an
   early stage. This study investigates the industry practice and needs for
   BIM-LCA, and if these are met through a prototype for the Danish
   context, using IFC and a 3D view. Eight qualitative in-depth interviews
   were conducted with medium and large architect, engineering, and
   contractor companies, covering a large part of the Danish AEC industry.
   The companies used a quantity take-off approach, and a few were
   developing plug-in approaches. Challenges included the lack of quality
   in the models, thus most companies supplemented model data with other
   data sources. Features they found valuable for BIM-LCA included visual
   interface, transparency of data, automation, design evaluation, and
   flexibility. The 3D view of the prototype met some of the needs,
   however, there were mixed responses on the use of IFC, due to different
   workflow needs in the companies. Future BIM-LCA development should
   include considerations on the lack of quality in models and should
   support different workflows.},

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for Estimating Building Embodied Carbon Based on
   Digital Twin Technology and Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Low-carbon building design requests an estimation of total embodied
   carbon as the environmental performance metric for comparison of
   different design options in early design stages. Due to a lack of
   consensus on the system boundaries in building life cycle assessment
   (LCA), the carbon estimation results obtained by the current methods are
   often disputable. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for
   estimating building embodied carbon based on digital twin technology and
   LCA. The proposed method is advantageous over others by providing (1) a
   cradle-to-cradle LCA and (2) an automated data communication between LCA
   and building information modelling (BIM) databases. Because data for the
   processes in the life cycle are collected via digital twin technology in
   a standard and consistent way, the obtained results will be considered
   credible. So far, a conceptual framework is developed based on a
   comprehensive literature review, which consists of three parts. In the
   first part, formulas for LCA are given. In the second part, a hybrid
   approach combining semantic web with a relational database for BIM and
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) integration is described. In the
   third part, how to design the LCA database and how to link LCA with BIM
   are described. The conceptual framework proposed is tested for its
   reasonableness by a small hypothetical case study.},

Title = {A 6D CAD Model for the Automatic Assessment of Building Sustainability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Current building assessment methods limit themselves in their
   environmental impact by failing to consider the other two aspects of
   sustainability: the economic and the social. They tend to be complex and
   costly to run, and therefore are of limited value in comparing design
   options. This paper proposes and develops a model for the automatic
   assessment of a building's sustainability life cycle with the building
   information modelling (BIM) approach and its enabling technologies. A 6D
   CAD model is developed which could be used as a design aid instead of as
   a post-construction evaluation tool. 6D CAD includes 3D design as well
   as a fourth dimension (schedule), a fifth dimension (cost) and a sixth
   dimension (sustainability). The model can automatically derive
   quantities (5D), calculate economic (5D and 6D), environmental and
   social impacts (6D), and evaluate the sustainability performance of
   alternative design options. The sustainability assessment covers the
   life cycle stages of a building, namely material production,
   construction, operation, maintenance, demolition and disposal.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The development of computational tools and the ability to simulate a
   large amount of data in relation to a variety of climatic conditions has
   helped to make informed decisions about alternative solutions for
   bioclimatic building design. At the same time, the combination of
   advanced design models and tools such as Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) and environmental assessment methodologies such as Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) offer the opportunity for undertaking holistic
   technical, economic and environmental approaches for the environmental
   design of buildings. This study aspires to deliver a comprehensive model
   for the optimal computational design of building overhangs through the
   use of an integrated building information model. The analysis is
   implemented for different normalized shading projection geometries,
   different orientations and different climatic data, using
   well-established BIM and LCA tools. The energy intensity indicators of
   the alternative overhang designs, as well as their energy depreciation
   time are presented. The findings of this work are expected to provide
   well-documented guidance on the design of overhangs for bioclimatic
   buildings, as well as be used as benchmark for analysis in a
   corresponding combinational logic (BIM and LCA) in constructing
   bioclimatic elements.},

Abstract = {The integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Life Cycle Costing
   (LCC) of buildings into Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been a
   trending research area in construction management. The current practice
   has involved the combined use of BIM tools (such as Autodesk Revit, and
   Navisworks) for 3D building modelling, Building Energy Modelling (BEM)
   tools (such as EnergyPlus and DOE-2), and Environmental Impact
   Assessment (EIA) tools (such as Athena Eco-calculator, Tally and
   SimaPro, etc.) to conduct LCA of buildings. One of the major limitations
   observed in this approach is the interoperability (data loss) issues, as
   well as the complexity arising from employing many tools especially at
   the early building design stage. This paper is a critique of
   conventional BIM-integrated LCA of buildings. It proposes a real-time
   BIM-integrated LCA/LCC that allows the designer to get immediate
   feedback (on energy, carbon, LCC, and exergy) at key stages of the
   design process. It concludes that an improved approach is needed for
   BIM-integrated LCA/LCC adoption at the early design stage, which is when
   most of the sustainability decisions are made.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, particular focus has been devoted to the life
   cycle performance of fastening systems, which is reflected in increasing
   numbers of publications, standards and large-scale research efforts.
   Simultaneously, experience shows that in many cases, where fastening
   systems are implemented - such as industrial facilities the design of
   fasteners is governed by fatigue loading under dynamic characteristics.
   In order to perform an adequate design and to specify the most efficient
   and appropriate fastening product, the engineer needs to access and
   process a broad range of technical and commercial information. Building
   information modelling (BIM), as a data management method in the
   construction industry, can supply such information and accommodate a
   comprehensive design and specification process. Furthermore, the
   application of BIM-based processes, such as the generation of a
   BIM-model, allows to use the important information for the construction
   as well as the life cycle management with different actions and time
   dependencies of the asset and its components. As a consequence, the BIM
   model offers the potential to correlate different data relevant for
   achieving the goals of the respective application, in order to ensure a
   more effective and correct design of the fastening. This paper
   demonstrates such a BIM-based design framework for an Industry 4.0 case,
   and in particular, the installation of a factory robot through
   post-installed anchors under fatigue-relevant loading in concrete.},

   Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Real estate markets are ideal investment options that lead to the
   construction industry's and the economy's growth. Therefore, having
   appropriate investment and valuation strategies is a critical success
   factor. Most established valuation methods emphasize market value and
   economic factors and are ignorant about buildings' technical and
   structural attributes. Therefore, due to the process ambiguity and lack
   of information access, the estimated price usually differs from the real
   property value. In this research, a revised valuation framework is
   proposed based on the life cycle cost (LCC) of residential properties,
   focusing on the operation phase. LCC consists of all costs related to an
   asset during different phases of its lifecycle, and it helps determine
   the net present value of the property. For systematically storing and
   analyzing technical and financial information, building information
   modeling (BIM) was proposed. Despite being widely used in the design and
   construction phases, its application and competitive advantage to real
   estate developers and managers during the operation phase are not
   transparent. This research benefitted from the 5D BIM model with a level
   of development (LOD) of 300 to increase the transparency and validity of
   valuation. An 18.25\% difference between the calculated price of two
   case studies in Tehran and their inflated market prices proved this
   assertion. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Environmental impacts and BIM: a Portuguese heritage case study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 10},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to compare the possible environmental impacts of
   different rehabilitation solutions proposed to a case study of a
   Portuguese vernacular building, bearing in mind the need to search for
   less impactful practices in accordance with global agendas and,
   simultaneously, the importance of preserving heritage
   assets.Design/methodology/approachThe two proposed solutions differ from
   each other in the selection of materials, varying from the exclusive use
   of conventional contemporary materials to the use of locally sourced and
   natural-based materials, considering the Portuguese and local scenario.
   Results obtained from Life Cycle Assessment procedures are the basis of
   comparison, which were developed using a Building Information Model
   (BIM)-integrated analytical plugin.FindingsProducing Heritage Building
   Information Model (HBIM) models was essential to the analysis, and
   therefore is a vital part of the used methodology; nevertheless, the
   modelling of heritage buildings itself plays an important part in
   preserving heritage assets once it provides precise documenting and
   managing tools. The results depict variation in values for different
   indicators in both cases, whose interpretation might need further
   development to get to deeper conclusions. It has been found that the
   software tools are still not well adapted to analyse heritage or
   historic buildings, and therefore adaptations had to take place to
   overcome these limitations.Originality/valueThe study distinguishes
   itself by involving the production of HBIM models and the use of
   BIM-integrated Life Cycle Assessment plugins as well as its analyses, to
   validate this approach.},

Title = {Assessing economic and environmental performance of infill materials
   through BIM: a life cycle approach},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 4},
Abstract = {PurposeInfill materials play a pivotal role in determining buildings'
   life cycle costing (LCC) and environmental impacts. International
   standards prescribe LCC and life cycle assessments (LCA) to assess
   materials' economic and environmental sustainability. The existing
   methods of LCC and LCA are tedious and time-consuming, reducing their
   practical application. This study sought to integrate LCC and LCA with
   building information modeling (BIM) to develop a swift and efficient
   approach for evaluating the life cycle performance of infill
   materials.Design/methodology/approachThe BIM model for a case study was
   prepared using Autodesk Revit (R), and the study included four infill
   materials (lightweight aggregate concrete block (LECA), autoclaved
   cellular concrete (AAC), concrete masonry and bricks). LCC was conducted
   using Revit (R) and Autodesk Insight 360 (R) to estimate costs incurred
   across different project phases. LCA was conducted using ``One Click LCA
   (R),{''} a BIM-based platform featuring a comprehensive material
   inventory. Carbon emissions, acidification, and eutrophication were
   chosen as environmental impact factors for LCA.FindingsLECA was the
   preferred choice due to its lower cost and environmental impact. Its
   lifetime cost of \$440,618 was 5.4\% lower than bricks', with 2.8\%
   lower CO2 emissions than AAC's, which were second-place options,
   respectively. LECA had 6.4 and 27\% lower costs than concrete blocks,
   and AAC's carbon emissions were 32 and 58\% lower than concrete blocks
   and bricks, respectively.Originality/valueBIM has been employed for life
   cycle analysis in existing literature, but its efficacy in evaluating
   the lifetime costs and environmental impacts of infill materials remains
   unexplored. The current study presents a BIM-based approach for
   conducting LCC and LCA of infill materials, facilitating informed
   decision-making during the planning phase and promoting sustainable
   construction practices.},

Abstract = {In comparison to other manufacturing industries, labor productivity per
   employed person has been stagnating for years. Despite the increasing
   use of digital planning methods in practice, the reasons include
   insufficient standardization and an associated lack of automation of
   processes and calculations. As a result, selective and deterministic
   building cost calculations still exist, which usually take place only at
   late planning stages. Hence, the inadequate identification and
   communication of opportunities and risks as well as the usually missing
   consideration of the usage costs preclude a holistic view and
   optimization of buildings.
   The following web-based tool BIM2pLCC (BIM to probabilistic
   Life-Cycle-Costing) provides a solution for the efficient calculation of
   probabilistic life cycle cost analyzes at different levels of
   information. The chosen implementation allows cost calculations to be
   performed either using three input parameters and statistical enrichment
   of (cost-) characteristics, or on the basis of BIM models with different
   information content. Therefore, a continuous probabilistic life cycle
   cost analysis can be integrated into the planning process and planning
   decisions can be made with a profound information background.},

Title = {Evaluation of cost-effective measures for the renovation of existing
   dwellings in the framework of the energy certification system: A case
   study in Norway},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {264},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for existing dwellings has not
   been able to promote the renovation rate. The main reasons are
   associated with the low quality of the assessment and renovation
   recommendations provided. These are not able to provide the information
   or confidence needed to undertake a renovation project. So far, neither
   reports for the EPBD nor studies by researchers have proposed
   modifications to the model used to assess existing buildings under the
   EPBD. The present research proposes a procedure to evaluate, design
   improvements, store and share data on the renovation process of each
   building. Specifically, the procedure is based on three steps, the first
   one is to apply simplified measurements on the dwelling, laser scanning
   and envelope testing. The second stage, using the electricity
   consumption data, was to calibrate and calculate the thermal properties
   of the building. Finally, tailormade recommendations for the whole life
   cycle of the house are proposed and stored in a database. After an
   optimisation and life cycle analysis of different measurement packages.
   The results show that by incorporating currently available tools, such
   as scanners, smart meters and BIM, a complete building condition profile
   can be obtained, stored and shared, and renovation measures with their
   benefits and costs can be realistically proposed. This study is in line
   with what has been proposed by previous studies, the need to digitise
   the certification system, to use new technologies and to capture the
   trust of the users.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Construction sector contracts have relevant socioeconomic importance in
   contrast with its high environmental impact due to the intensive
   consumption of natural and energy resources throughout the buildings'
   service life. Thus, this sector has been object of actions aiming the
   promotion of low carbon construction and refurbishment given its
   potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by applying more
   sustainable materials and techniques. With the development of the
   building information modeling (BIM) methodology, it is possible to
   develop the different project specialities in an integrated and
   collaborative platform since its initial phase, also facilitating the
   integration of life cycle assessment (LCA). The present work aims to
   evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of prefabricated concrete
   elements of new construction and solutions of seismic reinforcement of
   these elements in an existing building, as well as their costs, through
   LCA methodology and life cycle cost (LCC). For this purpose, the BIM
   model of an industrial building with a prefabricated concrete structure
   was developed and the respective LCA was achieved. It was considered the
   model of a similar building with 30 years of existence, whose structural
   calculation not considered the correct strengthening to face seismic
   actions. The respective seismic reinforcement solution was analyzed, and
   the corresponding LCA was accomplished. For each case, the LCC was
   calculated. The analysis of the two buildings highlighted the importance
   of rehabilitation in the construction sector, since the environmental
   impacts and the associated costs are reduced when compared to the
   construction of a new building.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) continues gaining popularity in
   engineering construction as it helps lower the life cycle cost and
   ensure sustainability. The primary aim of this study was to delve into
   the effectiveness of BIM implementation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   (KSA) construction industry and understand the benefits, challenges, and
   risks associated with it. The present study has incorporated a
   qualitative and case study research design to investigate the
   effectiveness of BIM implementation. To this end, information was
   gathered through interviews involving BIM experts in the KSA, from which
   a thematic analysis was derived with the help of NVivo software. The
   results obtained highlight various benefits, challenges, and risks
   associated with the implementation of BIM tools, also covering the life
   cycle cost (LCC) and the procurement and type of contracts, initially
   referred to during the interviews, indicating that the importance of
   estimating the LCC in a project is crucial in the design phase, which
   also informs the decision making. In this case, 96.7\% of the
   participants agreed with this view. Moreover, two case studies were
   analysed to further demonstrate the effectiveness of BIM adoption. The
   outcomes of this study have the potential to add significant value to
   various aspects of engineering practice in the KSA.},

Title = {BIM-enabled computerized design and digital fabrication of
   industrialized buildings: A case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Industrialized construction leverages factory-based manufacturing and
   lean-site assembly to achieve higher industrial efficiency. Building
   information modeling (BIM) offers new opportunities to underpin the
   computerized design and fabrication of industrialized buildings,
   providing greater productivity and cost-effectiveness. In this study,
   attempts are made to review the state-of-the-art BIM applications on
   design and prefabrication automation of industrialized buildings, with
   more emphasis on the recent achievement in concrete 3D printing
   technology. Following this, a BIM method is proposed to support the
   detailed geometry design and digital fabrication of modular housings. A
   program interfaced within BIM is developed and demonstrated through
   discussions on its capacity in generating the geometry details of
   3D-printed modules. In addition, robotic simulation of 3D printing is
   performed to explore a flexible plan in producing the 3D-printed modules
   or components. The lessons learned from the study are discussed to
   highlight the future research challenges and opportunities. First, as
   current Industry Foundation Classes-based BIM model provides limited
   support to prefabrication, research on BIM open standards demands more
   attentions to interoperate the computerized design and computer-aided
   manufacturing. Moreover, today's industrialized buildings consist of
   sophisticated architectural, structural, and mechanical systems that are
   intervened across the whole life cycle, more research on the
   interdependent building systems is needed (via digital twins) to
   optimize the life cycle performance. When moving towards data-driven
   decision making, there are research needs to expand Internet of Things
   and Artificial Intelligence to collect the big data from prefabrication,
   perform predictive analysis, and optimize the control decisions for
   manufacturing facilities operations. This study illustrates the process
   and future work in BIM design and prefabrication automation that can
   assist practitioners to enhance the quality of industrialized
   construction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose The blockchain-based digital twin has been recognized as a
   prominent technological ecosystem featuring synergies with both
   established and emergent information management practice. The purpose of
   this research is to explore the applicability, interoperability and
   integrability of a blockchain-based digital twin for asset life cycle
   management and develop a model of framework which positions the digital
   twin within a broader context of current management practice and
   technological availability. Design/methodology/approach A systematic
   literature review was performed to map use cases of digital twin, IoT,
   blockchain and smart contract technologies. Surveys of industry
   professionals and analyses were conducted focussing on the mapped use
   cases' life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability and
   integrability with current asset life cycle management practice,
   exploring decision support capabilities and industry insights. Lastly, a
   model of framework was developed based on the use case, interoperability
   and integrability findings. Findings The results support approaching
   digitization initiatives with blockchain-based digital twins and the
   positioning of the concept as both a strategic tool and a
   multifunctional on-field support application. Integrability enablers
   include progression towards BIM level 3, decentralized program hubs,
   modular cross-technological platform interfaces, as well as mergeable
   and scalable blockchains. Practical implications Knowledge of use cases
   help highlight the functionality of an integrated technological
   ecosystem and its connection to comprehensive sets of asset life cycle
   management aspects. Exploring integrability enablers contribute to the
   development of management practice and solution development as user
   expectations and technological prerequisites are interlinked.
   Originality/value The research explores asset life cycle management use
   cases, interoperability and integrability enablers of blockchain-based
   digital twins and positions the technological ecosystem within current
   practice and technological availability.},

Abstract = {As an important kind of infrastructure, a tunnel's life is estimated to
   be 100 years or more. During its service life, an effective maintenance
   strategy plays an essential role in keeping its availability and safety.
   Maintenance work involves a set of participants, activities, and
   resources, and in this case, tunnel-related data are distributed to
   heterogeneous information management systems in varying formats,
   bringing difficulties to implement effective maintenance. This paper
   proposes an E-maintenance Framework for Public Infrastructure (EFPI),
   combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC), and Semantic Web technologies to help integrate
   heterogeneous data and expert knowledge, enable information sharing
   through the whole life cycle, and support maintenance managers to make
   effective maintenance decisions. A cost estimation case is provided in
   this paper to illustrate the implementation mechanism and validate the
   proposed approach.},

Title = {Comprehensive assessment of embodied environmental impacts of buildings
   using normalized environmental impact factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {334},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for many environmental issues during
   construction. Although many studies have evaluated buildings' life cycle
   embodied environmental impacts (LCEEI), the difference in units usually
   results in isolation and separation of impact assessments. Assessment
   results of different indicators and environmental issues often cannot be
   compared with each other. This paper proposed a building LCEEI
   evaluation approach by integrating building information modeling (BIM)
   and life cycle assessment (LCA). In the proposed approach, 24
   environmental impact factors (EIFs) from the cradle to the grave are
   firstly calculated and then linked to 10 building-related environmental
   issues. The comprehensive assessment of embodied environmental impacts
   is conducted with a three-step normalization process, including
   characterization, nondimensionalization, and quantitation. A reinforced
   concrete structure building is selected as a case to demonstrate the
   proposed approach. The case indicates that mineral resource consumption,
   timber consumption, and fossil fuel consumption contribute the top 3
   largest proportions (over 80\%) to the LCEEI of reinforced concrete
   structure buildings. The material production stage is the most crucial
   stage to improve a building's environmental performance. Concrete,
   steel, and timber are the top 3 materials generating the most EIF. The
   study enriches the knowledge of sustainable construction by proposing a
   BIM-LCA integration approach to comprehensively evaluate the LCEEI of
   buildings at the design stage.},

Title = {INTEGRATING DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS) AND BUILDING INFORMATION
   MODELING (BIM) TO OPTIMIZE THE SELECTION OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDING
   COMPONENTS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {399-420},
Abstract = {One of the challenges in sustainability analysis and its development is
   the optimum selection of sustainable materials to meet the project's
   requirements while doing sustainable design. This can only be achieved
   when project team adopt the use of a strategic approach while selecting
   the materials, although this could be a complex task for decision
   makers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers designers the ability
   to assess different design alternatives at the conceptual stage of a
   project. As a method of integration and through its modeling techniques,
   BIM can be used to assess the impacts of design alternatives on the
   energy saving of buildings all over their life. Furthermore, BIM has the
   potential to help designers select the right type of materials during
   the early design stage, and make vital decisions when selecting the
   materials that have sustainable impact on the building's life cycle.
   The main purpose of this study is to propose a methodology that
   integrates BIM with decision-making problem-solving approaches (i.e.
   Entropy-TOPSIS) in order to efficiently optimize the selection of
   sustainable building components at the conceptual design stage of
   building projects. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is
   developed by using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques
   to aid the design team decide on and select the optimum type of
   sustainable building components and design families while doing
   conceptual design of proposed projects, based on three main criteria
   (i.e. environmental factors, economic factors-{''}cost efficiency,{''}
   and social well-being) in an attempt to identify the influence of design
   variations on the whole building's sustainable performance.
   The multi-criteria procedure embedded in the DSS relies on numerical
   models to simulate alternative situations, as well as ranking the
   alternatives and select the best ones based on both the owners'
   strategic preferences and the availability of sustainable materials in
   the market. The set of models included in the DSS describes the
   relationship between sustainability criteria, manufacturers' sustainable
   materials and the interactions between project team that take place
   during the design of sustainable building projects. This paper aims at
   exposing the feasibility of using BIM for analysing the life cycle costs
   of sustainable buildings at the conceptual stage. The design
   alternatives suggested by the DSS are evaluated in an integrated
   environment that joins BIM concept and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method to
   analyze the operational cost of the whole building. An actual building
   project is used to validate the workability and capability of the
   proposed methodology.},

Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the planet has been negatively impacted by the
   construction industry due to the development of various infrastructures.
   Thus, it became one of the most polluting sectors that have required
   increasing the environmental awareness of public and private entities.
   Under these circumstances, there are urgent efforts required to mitigate
   these negative impacts. Different approaches have been made for
   sustainable buildings based on construction technologies, where
   sustainability must be included as the main premise from the initial
   stage of the project. Through a systematic literature review, different
   methodologies are analyzed such as Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Building Energy Modeling (BEM) based on
   the existing regulations and standards of each country. The existing
   digital tools allow for the development of various low-carbon
   technologies, including sustainable materials and new integrations
   between them to find sustainable solutions and reduce carbon emissions
   from buildings. Several limitations exist as Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) software does not have all the green applications.
   Therefore, clear results are needed for effective indicators to help
   interested parties appropriate these technologies and invest time and
   money in projects based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and learn
   a useful lesson for future projects from these technological tools.},

Abstract = {Eco-friendly building designs that use building information modeling
   (BIM) have become popular, and a variety of eco-friendly building
   assessment technologies that take advantage of BIM are being developed.
   However, existing building environmental performance assessment
   technologies that use BIM are linked to external assessment tools, and
   there exist compatibility issues among programs; it requires a
   considerable amount of time to address these problems, owing to the lack
   of experts who can operate the programs. This study aims to develop
   eco-friendly templates for assessing the embodied environmental impact
   of buildings using BIM authoring tools as part of the development of
   BIM-based building life cycle assessment (LCA) technologies. Therefore,
   an embodied environmental impact unit database was developed, for major
   building materials during production and operating stages, to perform
   embodied environmental impact assessments. Moreover, a major structural
   element library that uses the database was developed and a function was
   created to produce building environmental performance assessment results
   tables, making it possible to review the eco-friendliness of buildings.
   A case study analysis was performed to review the feasibility of the
   environmental performance assessment technologies. The results showed a
   less than 5\% effective error rate in the assessment results that were
   obtained using the technology developed in this study compared with the
   assessment results based on the actual calculation and operating stage
   energy consumption figures, which proves the reliability of the proposed
   approach.},

Title = {How to Obtain Accurate Environmental Impacts at Early Design Stages in
   BIM When Using Environmental Product Declaration. A Method to Support
   Decision-Making},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The construction sector plays an important role in moving towards a
   low-carbon economy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered one of the
   most effective methods of analytically evaluating environmental profiles
   and an efficient tool for calculating the environmental impacts in
   building design-oriented methodologies, such as building information
   modelling (BIM). At early design stages, generic LCA databases are used
   to conduct the life cycle inventory (LCI), while detailed stages require
   more detailed data, such as environmental product declarations (EPDs),
   namely documents that provide accurate results and precise analyses
   based on LCA. Limitations are recognized when using EPDs in BIM elements
   at different levels of development (LOD) in the design stages,
   especially related to the data consistency and system boundaries of the
   LCA. This paper presents a method of achieving accurate LCA results,
   that helps with decision-making and provides support in the selection of
   building products and materials. The method is validated by its
   application in the structural concrete of an office building located in
   Germany. The method defines a safety factor adopted for embodied impacts
   ({''}cradle-to-gate{''}), based on EPD results to predict the
   environmental impact of BIM elements at different LODs. The results
   obtained show that by integrating the method to conduct the LCA, the
   range of errors and possible inconsistencies in the LCA results can be
   reduced.},

Abstract = {A design change may be considered a modification in a particular aspect
   of this design which has already been released and delivered (production
   phase) or even during its conception and development phase. Depending on
   the complexity and stage in the life cycle of the product where the
   change process is triggered, these changes may take from a few hours to
   several months to re-adapt the referred design. By applying concepts
   such as Parallelism, Concurrent Engineering, or most recently, Digital
   Manufacturing, it is imperative to guarantee that the resulting
   information about design changes is accurately propagated, reaches all
   involved stakeholders. Regarding Information and Knowledge Management,
   the emerging of new technologies such as Cloud Computing, Web Services
   or more specifically BIM (Building Information Modeling) have boosted
   the integration of all information projects in collaborative online
   environments. This paper further explores possibilities to use BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) technology for organizing and
   collaboration of the information and knowledge that comes with design
   changes through the entire products' lifecycle.},

Title = {Catalyzing sustainability through prefabrication: Integrating BIM-LCA
   for assessing embodied carbon in timber formwork waste},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Prefabrication is effective in reducing construction waste, as well as
   mitigating the associated carbon emissions. Timber formwork, as a
   crucial source of construction waste, has a substantial influence on the
   environmental performance of construction projects. Since no previous
   studies have investigated the effectiveness of prefabrication for
   reducing embodied carbon from timber formwork waste, this study develops
   a building information modeling (BIM) model of a case study building for
   quantifying timber formwork waste reduced under different prefabrication
   rates. The embodied carbon from cradle-to-cradle and during the
   materialization phase of timber formwork is calculated by employing life
   cycle assessment (LCA), while Monte Carlo simulation is conducted for
   uncertainty analysis by varying the parameters of consumption rates
   related to timber formwork waste. The results show that the
   manufacturing phase of timber formwork accounts for the largest
   proportion of embodied carbon: 83\% during materialization and 78\%
   throughout the cradle-to-cradle life cycle. The study also concludes
   that at a prefabrication rate of 88.47\%, 30.38 kg/m2 of timber formwork
   can be saved, resulting in reductions of 11.43 kg/m2 and 10.80 kg/m2 of
   associated embodied carbon during the cradle-to-cradle life cycle and
   during materialization, respectively; conversely, at a prefabrication
   rate of only 30.08\%, the reduction in embodied carbon during both
   phases decreases to 4.57 kg/m2 and 4.32 kg/m2, respectively.},

Abstract = {Ensuring sustainability for real estate is subject - among other aspects
   - to building related information. This information needs to be stored
   and updated continuously throughout the life cycle of a building. A
   delivery to buyers, tenants, consultants or other actors must be
   possible at any time. However, in most cases transactions cause
   significant loss of information while the issues associated with the
   ``building passport{''} approach remains unsolved to date. Considering
   the long service life of buildings, various questions arise: (1) How to
   support data generation and storage within the life cycle and how to
   encourage actors to compete? (2) How to assure a high data quality and
   how to store it over a long period of time? (3) How to assure that all
   data users can track down the data owners at any point of time to manage
   compliance and legal issues? (4) Are there any new business models or
   new scopes for designers or other service providers? Information needs
   of actors along the life cycle are analysed and new information
   technologies (e.g. blockchain) are discussed. A relation to Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) is shown. Potentials of enhancing existing
   approaches regarding documentation retracing and accessibility of
   building and life cycle related information by using new technologies
   and IT are discussed; benefits of using a blockchain based system is
   pointed out by referring to existing pilot projects and first examples.
   Solution approaches for building passports are shown.},

Abstract = {At present, the smart city offers the most desired state of urban
   development, encompassing, as it does, the concept of sustainable
   development. The creation of a smart city is closely associated with
   upgrading the construction industry to encompass many emerging concepts
   and technologies, such as Construction 4.0, with its roots in Industry
   4.0, and the deployment of building information modeling (BIM) as an
   essential tool for the construction industry. Therefore, this paper aims
   to explore the current state of the art and development trajectory of
   the multidisciplinary integration of Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0,
   BIM, and sustainable construction in the context of the smart city. It
   is the first attempt in the literature to use both macro-quantitative
   analysis and micro-qualitative analysis methods to investigate this
   multidisciplinary research topic. By using the visual bibliometric tool,
   VOSviewer, and based on macro keyword co-occurrence, this paper is the
   first to reveal the five keyword-constructed schemes, research hotspots,
   and development trends of the smart city, Construction 4.0, Industry
   4.0, BIM, and sustainable construction, from 2014 to 2021 (a period of
   eight years). Additionally, the top 11 productive subject areas have
   been identified with the help of VOSviewer software keyword-clustering
   analysis and application. Furthermore, the whole-building life cycle is
   considered as an aid to identifying research gaps and trends, providing
   suggestions for future research with the assistance of an upgraded
   version of BIM, namely, city information modeling (CIM) and the future
   integration of Industry 5.0 and Construction 5.0, or even of Industry
   Metaverse with Construction Metaverse.},

Abstract = {The current work presents a Malaysian housing sector experience to
   develop an innovative prediction model for the operational carbon
   footprint at planning and design stage. Besides life-cycle assessment
   methodology, statistical technique of multiple regressions incorporated
   the effects of different identified variables. Three-dimensional
   parametric models of selected case studies were developed in a virtual
   environment using building information modeling (BIM). The emergence of
   multiple regressions, BIM and LCA, in an environmental assessment study
   for operational phase in a tropical region unlocked a new direction of
   research. The successful satisfaction and qualification of statistical
   criterion and tests ensured an efficient prediction model with an

   demonstrate the entire building's life cycle, including its construction
   and operation. Because the design of a build may vary from an abstract
   shape to precise details, the building's database should vary
   accordingly. To store, manage and utilize the building's data
   efficiently, we suggest an evolving database structure for our design
   aid system. A case study verifies that the system can acquire data from
   CAD, run a number of simulations and generate Pareto solutions

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is an effective tool in
   determining the environmental impact of buildings. However, the LCA
   process requires extensive time and effort when applied to systems as
   complex as the life cycle of buildings. The development of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) Platforms offers interesting opportunities to
   simplify the process for drawing up LCAs in the case of buildings.
   Recent research shows that the use of BIM-based methods leads to a
   significant reduction in time and effort which practitioners dedicate to
   applying the LCA methodology to entire buildings. LCA phases such as
   Life Cycle Inventory, traditionally extremely time-consuming, is almost
   self-operating when BIM resources are in use. The level of automation of
   LCA elaboration could be optimized by using a) the programming
   possibilities within the BIM platform framework; and b) the
   standardization of the models for analysis. In the last few years there
   has been significant progress in these two fields, based on a line of
   research proposed by the Master's in Innovation in Architecture:
   Technology and Design in the University of Seville. There has been a
   considerable development of programming software integrated in BIM. Many
   regions have encouraged countries to use BIM platforms when documenting
   the construction process. This new conceptual framework provides the
   opportunity to assess the life cycle of numerous buildings in terms of
   the environment, obtaining specific environmental benchmarks for the
   different types. This communication describes a method proposed to
   obtain specific environmental benchmarks, - such as global warming
   potential and cumulative energy demand - for different types of
   dwellings using LCA methodology and BIM platforms. The application of
   this approach to different case studies is presented. The case studies
   selected for this research are those of housing located in different
   geographical and climate contexts and using different constructive
   systems (e.g. masonry construction, wood construction, steel
   construction). Finally, this paper provides the benchmarks resulting
   from the application of the proposed method to the case studies.},

Title = {Barriers to BIM-Based Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment for
   Buildings: An Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as central to
   construction design, planning, execution and maintenance, integration
   into the entire infrastructure sustainability process is imperative for
   achieving sustainable development. Despite its immense benefit of aiding
   compliance to sustainable construction, potential barriers continue to
   widen the gap in implementation. Therefore, this study adopts the
   ``interpretive structural modelling approach{''} to advance a ranked
   structure of the interrelatedness of the barriers to integrating BIM in
   buildings sustainability assessment. The ``Matrice d'Impacts
   croises-multipication applique a classement analysis (MICMAC){''} was
   utilised to categorise the identified adoption barriers in the model.
   The identified barriers and relationship with themselves are valuable in
   discussing the challenges to BIM-based LCA and developing policies and
   design decisions to drive the process further. Further, it adds to the
   emerging discussion of BIM from the life cycle sustainability assessment
   perspective for infrastructure. The findings are critical for policy,
   stakeholders and extending the body of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modelling (BIM) is increasingly being
   adopted during construction projects. Design and construction practices
   are adjusting to the new system. BIM is intended to support the entire
   project life-cycle: the design and construction phases, and also
   facility management (FM). However, BIM-enabled FM remains in its infancy
   and has not yet reached its full potential. The purpose of this paper is
   to identify major aspects of BIM in order to derive a fully BIM-enabled
   FM process.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 207 papers were classified into
   main and subordinate research areas for quantitative analysis. These
   findings were then used to conceptualise a BIM-enabled FM framework
   grounded by innovation diffusion theory for adoption, and for
   determining the path of future research.
   Findings - Through an extensive literature review, the paper summarises
   many benefits and challenges. Major aspects of BIM are identified in
   order to describe a BIM-enabled FM implementation process grounded by
   innovation diffusion theory. The major research areas of the proposed
   framework include: planning and guidelines; value realisation; internal
   leadership and knowledge; procurement; FM; specific application areas;
   data capture techniques; data integration; knowledge management; and
   legal and policy impact. Each element is detailed and is supported by
   literature. Finally, gaps are highlighted for investigation in future
   research.
   Originality/value - This paper systematically classifies and evaluates
   the existing research, thus contributing to the achievement of the
   ultimate vision of BIM-enabled FM. The proposed framework informs
   facility managers, and the BIM-enabled FM implementation process.
   Further, the holistic survey identifies gaps in the body of knowledge,
   revealing avenues for future research.},

Title = {Key Parameters Featuring BIM-LCA Integration in Buildings: A Practical
   Review of the Current Trends},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for 40\% of carbon emissions,
   14\% of water consumption and 60\% of waste production in the world,
   generating a state of unsustainability. In order to keep these values
   under control and make the most sustainable choices starting from the
   earliest stages of building design, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be
   used. This consists of an analysis of the environmental impacts of a
   product, activity or process throughout all phases of the life cycle.
   The fundamental problem of implementing this analysis process in the
   construction sector is the difficulty in managing the fragmented
   building information that covers all aspects of buildings life stages in
   an integrated way. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach
   offers the possibility of managing a complex information system in an
   integrated manner. The BIM-LCA integration solutions proposed in recent
   years made LCA analysis faster, cheaper and usable by more
   professionals. This paper proposes an analysis of the state of the art
   of the research published in the last ten years regarding the
   integration of BIM-LCA as a methodology whereby the BIM approach can
   support and simplify data management for LCA analysis. The aim was to
   present the work methodologies tested so far and to describe all the
   factors that were considered in applying the BIM-LCA integration. The
   novelty of this review consists of identifying a series of more
   recurrent parameters and measures used by most researchers deriving a
   trend of possible and consolidated workflows. The result is, therefore,
   to present evidence of a general heterogenous framework and to define
   the common and widespread approaches identifying the main features.},

Abstract = {Improving the environmental impact of the construction industry is a
   very significant way to achieve sustainability. The combination of
   building information modeling and life cycle assessment leads to improve
   the environmental performance of buildings. However, preliminary
   measures to achieve sustainability require complete knowledge and
   classification of building information modeling uses and environmental
   indicators. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify and prioritize
   building information modeling capabilities and environmental indicators
   in the early stages of design. A questionnaire was designed to survey
   experts in this field. By evaluating the building information modeling
   criteria and life cycle evaluation, using the Structural equation
   modeling method, it was found that 3D coordination, Phase planning, and
   Design reviews are the most important in the success of the project. In
   terms of life cycle assessment, control, and reduction indicators of
   Global Warming Potential, Land use impact, and Total Primary Energy, it
   has the greatest impact on improving the sustainable performance of a
   construction project. We also examined the interaction between the most
   effective building information modeling criteria and life cycle
   evaluation using the Delphi method. This approach improved project
   sustainability performance by reducing time, cost, resource consumption,
   and environmental impacts.},

Title = {User-centric sustainability assessment of single family detached homes
   (SFDH): A BIM-based methodological framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Traditionally, green building rating systems have used a
   building-centric sustainability evalua-tion. This research challenges
   the status-quo of building sustainability assessment with a user-centric
   approach. A user-centric sustainability evaluation can provide a
   comprehensive assess-ment of building from a user's perspective. An
   ideal user-centric building sustainability evalua-tion should extend
   from traditional building rating systems and should encompass the Triple
   Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability and resiliency with a life cycle
   thinking lens. This paper proposes a user-centric sustainability
   assessment method for Single Family Detached Homes (SFDH). Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) was used as the implementation platform for
   this method. The proposed framework was used to compare the
   sustainability performance of a certified and non-certified SFDH.
   Results indicated that certified SFDH performs poorly in the resiliency
   dimension and outperforms non-certified SFDH in environmental, social,
   and economic categories. User-centric evaluation provides a more
   granular building sustainability evaluation and will be a piece of the
   puzzle in developing an individualized sustainability evaluation system.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) during the entire life
   cycle of a building or facility requires an up-to-date and detailed
   digital representation. Nowadays the BIM focus mostly lies on the design
   and construction phase of the building and is rarely used for the rest
   of the life cycle. For further use the BIM must be updated after
   construction and enriched with appliance objects such as safety
   equipment, heating elements to enhance its usability. In this work a new
   approach is presented to detect and locate appliance objects in a three
   dimensional environment using object detection in images created by
   indoor mobile mapping devices. By detecting and locating these appliance
   objects in the three dimensional world they can be included in the BIM
   model. This approach enables the detection and localization needed for
   the placement of placeholders or detailed geometric models of those
   appliances in the BIM model or other digital representations. Resulting
   in an increased level of detail and usability of the digital
   representation of the building or facility during its further life
   cycle. Overall, this work demonstrates and examines the accuracy of the
   detection and localization of appliance objects.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Considering the world population, an additional 415.1 billion
   m(2 )of built floor will be needed by 2050, which could worsen the
   environmental impact of the construction industry that is responsible
   for one-third of global Carbon Emissions (CEs). Thus, the current
   construction practices need to be upgraded toward eco-friendly
   technologies. Building Information Modeling (BIM) proved a significant
   potential to enhance Building and Infrastructure (B \& I) ecological
   performances. However, no previous study has evaluated the nexus between
   BIM and B \& I CEs. This study aims to fill this gap by disclosing the
   research evolution and metrics and key concepts and tools associated
   with this nexus. Design/methodology/approach- A mixed-method design was
   adopted based on scientometric and scoping reviews of 52 consistent
   peer-reviewed papers collected from 3 large scientific databases.
   Findings - This study presented six research metrics and revealed that
   the nexus between BIM and CEs is a contemporary topic that involves
   seven main research themes. Moreover, it cast light on six key
   associated concepts: Life Cycle Assessment; Boundary limits; Building
   Life Cycle CE (BLCCE); Responsible sources for BLCCE; Green and
   integrated BIM; and sustainable buildings and related rating systems.
   Furthermore, it identified 56 nexus-related Information and
   Communication Technologies tools and 17 CE-coefficient databases and
   discussed their consistency. Originality/value - This study will fill
   the knowledge gap by providing scholars, practitioners and
   decision-makers with a good grasp of the nexus between CEs and BIM and
   paving the path toward further research, strategies and technological
   solutions to decrease CEs of B \& I sectors and their impacts on the
   climate change.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To make use of the great opportunities for emission reduction in early
   building design, future emissions need to be calculated when only
   geometric, but no detailed material information about a building is
   available. Currently, early design phase life cycle assessments (LCAs)
   are heavily reliant on assumptions of specific material choices, leading
   to single point emission values which suggest a precision not
   representative for an early design stage. By adding knowledge about
   possible locations and functions of materials within a building to life
   cycle inventory (LCI) data, the EarlyData knowledge base makes LCA data
   sets accessible and more transparent. Additionally, ``generic building
   parts{''} are defined, which describe building parts independently of
   precise material choices as a combination of layers with specific
   functions. During evaluation, enriched LCI data and generic building
   parts enable assessment of a vast number of possible material
   combinations at once. Thus, instead of single value results for a
   particular material combination, ranges of results are displayed
   revealing the building parts with the greatest emission reduction
   potential. The application of the EarlyData tool is illustrated on a use
   case comparing a wood building and a concrete building. The database is
   developed with extensibility in mind, to include other criteria, such as
   (life cycle) costs.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between energy use,
   geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied
   worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle
   impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed
   and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to
   the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life
   cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy
   consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable
   variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations
   (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The
   variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with
   life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better
   understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of
   building energy consumption in the context of green building rating
   systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems
   approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market
   transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into
   consideration both energy sources and building efficiency.},

Abstract = {As building automation becomes more prevalent, smart buildings will be
   integrated into smart cities. Using artificial intelligence (AI) is
   expected to increase efficiency and the automation level throughout the
   whole life cycle of building information modeling (BIM). Especially for
   the management phase of a building, facility managers are recognizing
   the value of machine learning and robotics for the automation of
   different maintenance tasks. In the fire safety management field,
   documentation of fire safety equipment (FSE) is required due to
   recurring maintenance work, system changes, and relocations. This study
   concentrates on the automatic detection of inspection tags on FSE using
   a YOLO network and its deployment on a mobile robot. The goal is to
   create a fully autonomous inspection mission for a legged robot by
   executing predefined routes, identifying FSE, and extracting necessary
   information, such as the next maintenance date tags.},

Title = {The BIM2LCA Approach: An Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-Based
   Interface to Integrate Life Cycle Assessment in Integral Planning},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An increasing degree of digitalization in construction planning offers
   significant potential for building life cycle assessment (LCA) to reduce
   access barriers, as well as the assessment effort itself. To realize the
   widespread application of LCA tools and their potential to effectively
   minimize life cycle impacts, an open approach is required that allows
   for flexible application of comprehensive LCA studies and early
   integration in planning processes. The authors present an approach for
   LCA integration in all phases of digital planning which aims at a DGNB
   (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur nachhaltiges Bauen) certification based on
   the open Building Information Modeling (BIM) standard Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC). The approach takes into account varying levels
   of development and resulting data availability during integral planning
   phases, as well as resulting LCA application contexts. It goes beyond
   existing strategies and allows one to consider both BIM and LCA software
   through a workflow based on a single data format. The assessment
   framework is operationalized through standardized interface development
   and technical realization following the information delivery manual
   (IDM) process standardized for IFC interfaces. The Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) schema, as a specific implementation for certification,
   provides the target system for LCA data requirements and is generalized
   to a planning phase specific IDM base table. The technical realization
   based on respective model view definitions and distributed data suggests
   a pathway to the standardization of LCA-IFC integration based on an open
   approach. The overall approach exemplarily applies to the
   ``LERNZENTRUM{''} at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) campus.
   We conclude that an open BIM approach for LCA integration in model-based
   planning is feasible, but requires several adjustments in IFC, LCA, and
   planning practice. Adding a lifecycle element to the IFC to connect BIM
   and LCA provides comprehensive feedback for informed decision making
   based on environmental impact.},

   SAVING ELEMENTS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {173-192},
Abstract = {This study introduces a novel approach to configuring buildings' outer
   envelopes with the objective of optimizing Life Cycle Cost. This
   approach is based on the assumption that not all building elements
   constituting the outer envelope are subjected to the same amount of
   thermal transmission losses or solar radiation. Therefore, an
   optimization approach based on segmenting external facades and roofs
   into independent objects in a building information model was developed.
   A Genetic Algorithm is coupled with Industry Foundation Classes, an
   Energy Simulation software tool and a Life Cycle Cost estimation model
   to achieve an optimal allocation of energy saving elements to buildings'
   external envelopes, the use of which allows for a positive return on
   additional investment in energy saving elements. The developed approach
   is applied to a case study of a desert building in Egypt. The paper also
   investigates the influence of Egyptian energy prices subsidization
   policy relevant to energy saving costs using the case study.},

   analyzed that could be modeled using Levels of Detail (LODs) via BIM and
   defined the LODs that were to be used in LCA. Different correction
   methods for the supply quantity of each of the major building materials
   were proposed using the waste factor method, reinforcement factor
   method, and standard quantity method, and their applicability were
   examined in a case study. As a result, the values of all major building
   materials quantities to which correction methods were applied were
   closer to the supply quantities in actual structures than were the
   BIM-based values.},

Title = {Recommendations for Developing a BIM for the Purpose of LCA in Green
   Building Certifications},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are
   two methods that can be helpful when designing buildings with lower
   environmental impacts. One of the most significant examples of
   environmental impact assessments in construction is green building
   certification. Certified buildings have improved performance and greater
   asset value. In this study, four certification systems were investigated
   for their potential interconnections with BIM and LCA. The main tasks
   were (1) to review a BIM-based workflow, (2) assess its usage as an
   input for the LCA within green certifications, and (3) provide
   suggestions for developing building models. Building models can be
   helpful during the design process, but the best results are expected
   when the specifically described steps are followed. These suggestions
   aim at improving building models in terms of their usage for green
   building certifications and particularly for LCA. All the investigated
   results were clarified and adjusted using a model of a recently finished
   building in Zug. As reference tools, One Click LCA and a manual process
   were selected. The outcomes were aligned with those of other studies and
   confirmed the necessity of good data and management quality for building
   projects.},

Abstract = {The consideration of resource consumption and greenhouse gas relevant
   emissions is becoming increasingly important. The life cycle assessment
   method has been the basis for several years in sustainability assessment
   systems such as DGNB and BNB for assessing the environmental impact of
   buildings. So far, LCA has only been used as a verification tool and not
   within the planning process as an optimization tool. This is mainly due
   to the time required to set up a life cycle assessment. In order to
   reduce the expenditure of time and to facilitate accompanying building
   LCAs, a concept was developed which enables the use of building LCAs
   already in early planning phases on the basis of benchmarks and on
   varying degrees of detail. In addition, the level of information and the
   respective questions per planning phase were derived on the basis of the
   concept of integral planning; data gathering using Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) was planned and implemented. In total, four different
   levels of detail were developed, which, similar to the cost estimation
   of buildings, allow an estimation of the environmental effects in
   different concretization stages.},

Title = {Detailed Assessment of Embodied Carbon of HVAC Systems for a New Office
   Building Based on BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The global shift towards embodied carbon reduction in the building
   sector has indicated the need for a detailed analysis of environmental
   impacts across the whole lifecycle of buildings. The environmental
   impact of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has
   rarely been studied in detail. Most of the published studies are based
   on assumptions and rule of thumb techniques. In this study, the
   requirements and methods to perform a detailed life cycle assessment
   (LCA) for HVAC systems based on building information modelling (BIM) are
   assessed and framed for the first time. The approach of linking external
   product data information to objects using visual programming language
   (VPL) is tested, and its benefits over the existing workflows are
   presented. The detailed BIM model of a newly built office building in
   Switzerland is used as a case study. In addition, detailed project
   documentation is used to ensure the plausibility of the calculated
   impact. The LCA results show that the embodied impact of the HVAC
   systems is three times higher than the targets provided by the Swiss
   Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040). Furthermore, it is shown that the
   embodied impact of HVAC systems lies in the range of 15-36\% of the
   total embodied impact of office buildings. Nevertheless, further
   research and similar case studies are needed to provide a robust picture
   of the embodied environmental impact of HVAC systems. The results could
   contribute to setting stricter targets in line with the vision of
   decarbonization of the building sector.},

Title = {BIM-based optimization approach to reduce life cycle costs by focusing
   on the integration of construction and operation phases in
   office-commercial buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This study investigates the application of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) to reduce life cycle costs (LCC) by addressing critical
   nonconformances encountered during the construction and operational
   phases of buildings. The primary aim is to identify nonconformances that
   escalate operational costs and to evaluate how BIM can effectively
   reduce these costs. The research begins with a comprehensive review of
   existing literature and utilizes the Delphi method to identify four key
   nonconformances that most significantly impact operational expenses. To
   further analyze these issues, semi-structured interviews and the
   Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are employed to
   determine the cost ranges of components associated with these
   nonconformances in both the construction and operational phases. The
   study finds that BIM-based optimization can lead to substantial cost
   reductions, although there are limitations due to the lack of precise
   data on the operational phase of low-cost equipment. The key
   contribution of this research is the development of a framework that
   helps designers create more effective BIM models, enhancing facilities
   management (FM) and reducing LCC. The originality of this study lies in
   its integrated approach, combining BIM and optimization techniques to
   directly address operational cost issues, which provides a novel
   perspective on improving life cycle cost management in buildings. Future
   research should expand the dataset and explore a broader range of
   nonconformances to refine and extend the framework's applicability.},

Title = {A model for predicting the environmental impacts of educational

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of a building are determined in the project
   planning phase, affecting the whole life cycle of the building. Thus,
   they should be assessed in the project planning phase so as to reduce
   the whole environment impacts of the building. This study aims to
   develop a model for predicting the environmental impacts of a building
   in the project planning phase, focused on educational facilities. This
   study was conducted in three steps: (i) collection of several
   information on educational facilities and cluster formation using the
   decision tree; (ii) development of the prediction model using the
   advanced case-based reasoning; and (iii) evaluation of the environmental
   impacts of educational facilities with six categories. The proposed
   model was verified compared to the actual data. The error rate for the
   resource depletion potential was determined to be at 14.14\%; global
   warming potential, 6.80\%; ozone-layer depletion potential, 27.29\%;
   acidification potential, 12.94\%; eutrophication potential, 18.73\%; and
   photochemical oxidation potential, 43.23\%. Due to the limitations of
   the available information in the project planning phase, it was shown
   that some impact categories might be estimated with relatively lower
   accuracy. The proposed model allows an architect or a facility manager
   to easily and accurately estimate the environmental impacts of the
   educational facilities. It could also be useful for establishing a
   national environmental policy such as a carbon emissions reduction
   target. In addition, it could be extended to any other building type or
   country in the global environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Professionals involved in the early design stages, usually have
   difficulties understanding the use of Life Cycle Assessment tools. This
   entails major drawbacks, as it is precisely in these phases when
   decisions that generate the greatest impacts on the project life cycle
   are made. As a result, this research aims to propose and test a workflow
   that integrates environmental and economic sustainability criteria in
   the early phases of building design using Building Information Modeling
   and a Chilean database. First, the workflow was conceptualized and
   imple-mented. Then, the implementation was validated by a group of
   professionals from the construction sector, through a practical case. A
   survey was applied to them to measure the integration in terms of time,
   applicability, scalability, and ease of understanding. The main findings
   suggest that the proof of concept is valid and that it could continue to
   be developed and thus contribute to bringing sustainability criteria
   into early design stages.},

Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},

Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is regarded as useful for making design decisions
   regarding the environmental and health impacts of building products and
   materials. This research aimed at studying the process of BIM-LCA
   integration to assist designers in making sustainable material and
   product selection decisions in Ghana. A guidance framework for
   implementation of BIM-LCA supported by energy analysis has been
   developed to aid optimisation of sustainable design solutions based on
   simulations using Autodesk Revit as a BIM authoring tool, Green Building
   Studio and Tally to perform energy and LCA simulations on a hypothetical
   two-bedroom single-family house. The research considers both operational
   and embodied carbon effects of the design solution. The framework aligns
   with the RIBA Plan of Work 2013 Stages 0-2 (i.e. Strategic definition,
   Preparation and briefing, and Concept design) and presents a systematic
   approach for BIM-based LCA estimation for the early design stages using
   the Business Process Modelling Notation. The paper proposes a generic
   approach which has the potential to incorporate LCA as an integral part
   to the BIM-enabled design development process. This assists designers in
   decision-making that consider environmental impacts of materials and
   energy consumption as part of sustainable building design
   considerations.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling brings a fundamental technological
   innovation to the traditional architecture industry, which can optimize
   the construction process and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
   the overall building process. Based on the information exchange of
   heterogeneous information systems and data around different stages of
   the whole life cycle of a building project, this article analyses the
   current state of building information interoperability and proposes an
   ontology-based information integration framework. In addition,
   hierarchical clustering method is used to analyze and find risk factors
   for surface subsidence in an underground tunnel construction project,
   and the results input into the information integration framework. The
   proposed approach maps the industry foundation classes data and
   relationships to an ontology, and utilizes an ontology-based reasoning
   model. An ontology for the underground tunnel has been developed using
   Prot,g, and a Jena inference engine has been developed to investigate
   the early warning signs of ground subsidence.},

Abstract = {Prediction of construction cost and life-cycle cost through preliminary
   estimate is very important for the economic decision-making in the early
   phase of building projects. However, the conventional preliminary
   estimate has a high error range and low reliability because it relies
   only on the basic information of projects. In addition, the
   consideration of the life-cycle cost of the building is insufficient,
   causing problems such as budget shortage, inaccurate budgeting, and
   life-cycle cost increase. In this study, we propose a method of
   preliminary estimate based on BIM below the level of detail 2 and actual
   construction cost data to support the decision-making in the early
   design phase. To verify the proposed method, a web-based prototype was
   implemented and applied to three test cases. The range of error rate for
   three test cases was 1.93-7.16\% (average error rate: 5.18\%). It
   satisfies the criteria (-30\% \~{} +50\%) of the ``American Association
   of Cost Engineering{''}. As a result, the feasibility of the proposed
   model was validated. It is expected to be utilized as useful information
   in the decision-making occurring in the early design phase, and this
   allows for a rapid economic review of the design alternatives, a reduced
   LCC, and a shortened decision-making time.},

Abstract = {With the rising adoption of Building Information Model (BIM) for asset
   management within architecture, engineering, construction and
   owner-operated (AECO) sector, BIM-enabled asset management has been
   increasingly attracting more attentions in both research and practice.
   This study provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the
   state-of-the-art latest research and industry standards development that
   impact upon BIM and asset management within the operations and
   maintenance (O\&M) phase. However, BIM is not always enough in
   whole-life cycle asset management, especially in the O\&M phase.
   Therefore, a framework for future development of smart asset management
   is proposed, integrating the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT integrates
   artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create
   dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of
   the physical counterpart from multiple sources. The findings will
   contribute to inspiring novel research ideas and promote widespread
   adoption of smart DT-enabled asset management within the O\&M phase.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {407},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {This study presents a method which allows conducting an energy and
   emission related Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and cost-related Life Cycle
   Cost Assessment (LCC) of large residential building stocks focusing on
   selected heating system components. Using this method the status quo as
   well as two refurbishment scenarios for an entire neighbourhood with 196
   residential buildings in Munich, Germany, is assessed. Within the status
   quo and the refurbishment scenarios, among other things, the use of
   different energy systems and energy standards of the building envelope
   are investigated. CityGML semantic 3D city models serve as a source of
   building-specific information for these assessments. The results show
   that even if all residential buildings are refurbished to passive house
   standard and powered by renewable energies by 2035, life cycle-based
   energy demands and emissions will still be present, that counteract the
   goal of achieving climate neutrality. In addition, the life cycle-based
   costs exceed the savings achieved by the refurbishment. The developed
   method is implemented in Java which provides on the one hand a new
   approach to assessing building stocks on a life cycle basis and on the
   other hand its transferability. This results in innovative evaluation
   and assessment possibilities for political and municipal
   decision-makers.},

Title = {Leveraging Infrastructure BIM for Life-Cycle-Based Sustainable Road
   Pavement Management},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The latest developments in the field of road asphalt materials and
   pavement construction/maintenance technologies, as well as the spread of
   life-cycle-based sustainability assessment techniques, have posed issues
   in the continuous and efficient management of data and relative
   decision-making process for the selection of appropriate road pavement
   design and maintenance solutions; Infrastructure Building Information
   Modeling (IBIM) tools may help in facing such challenges due to their
   data management and analysis capabilities. The present work aims to
   develop a road pavement life cycle sustainability assessment framework
   and integrate such a framework into the IBIM of a road pavement project
   through visual scripting to automatically provide the informatization of
   an appropriate pavement information model and evaluate sustainability
   criteria already in the design stage through life cycle assessment and
   life cycle cost analysis methods. The application of the proposed
   BIM-based tool to a real case study allowed us (a) to draw
   considerations about the long-term environmental and economic
   sustainability of alternative road construction materials and (b) to
   draft a maintenance plan for a specific road section that represents the
   best compromise solution among the analyzed ones. The IBIM tool
   represents a practical and dynamic way to integrate environmental
   considerations into road pavement design, encouraging the use of digital
   tools in the road industry and ultimately supporting a pavement
   maintenance decision-making process oriented toward a circular economy.},

Title = {Impact factor analysis affecting the operation of asset lifecycle by

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 5},
Abstract = {PurposeCurrently, owners find it difficult to manage their assets
   throughout their project life cycle. The fact that asset information
   models (AIMs) are mandatory as deliverables for building information
   modeling-driven projects makes it a key requirement for the client to
   understand in detail those factors affecting asset operation. Hence,
   because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most significant market in
   the Middle East, this study aims to investigate those factors where
   blockchain and AIMs could impact the asset management (AM) life
   cycle.Design/methodology/approachResearchers used a hypothesis-based
   approach over a systematic literature review and a workshop (descriptive
   statistics) to understand the current challenges in AM. Later, a second
   workshop was run to understand the impact factor analysis affecting the
   operation of the asset life cycle by using asset information modeling
   and blockchain technology over a multiquantitative
   method.FindingsResults found that factors affecting the operation of
   assets could be the improvement of trust and stakeholder's influences;
   the availability of handover process products' accurate data;
   manufacturers providing detailed product models; increasing the speed of
   preparing holistic and integrated AM systems; improving collaboration
   between stakeholders; and returning clients' investments
   faster.Originality/valueUnderstanding the factors affecting AM life
   cycle based on the utilization of AIMs and blockchain then allows
   investors and their team members to work in a secure and collaborative
   environment that helps them to pre-identify certain risks and improve
   decision-making in a more effective way, as is required by ISO55000.},

Title = {OpenBIM-based assessment for social cost of carbon through building life
   cycle},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Buildings produce many carbon emissions in their life cycle, which leads
   to global warming, human disease, ecosystem destruction, and food
   shortages. These harms are translated and revealed into the social cost
   of carbon (SCC), but assessing the building SCC considering protection
   objects is still difficult due to the lack of adequate and rapid tools.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on OpenBIM to calculate
   the SCC through the building life cycle. This method reflects the
   cause-effect chains of carbon emissions on human health, ecosystem
   quality, and social assets under LIME, EPS, and ReCiPe approaches. An
   original tool, NMBIM, is developed based on this proposed method, which
   calculates the SCC of a case building by directly importing industry
   foundation classes (IFC) files. The case results show that the maximum
   life cycle SCC reaches 5872.4 RMB/m2, which exceeds the construction
   cost. Although SCC results obtained by different LCIA models vary
   widely, the ones of human health are the most concerned protection
   objects. This paper provides an effective method for standardly storing
   and optimizing SCC at the project design stage, which contributes to
   construction industry planning, construction company decision-making,
   and public regulation.},

Title = {An overview of benefits and challenges of building information modelling
   (BIM) adoption in UK residential projects},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-320},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to present a state-of-the-art review of building
   information modelling (BIM) in the UK construction practice. In
   particular, the aim is to examine the scope, value and practical
   implications of BIM implementation in residential projects by evaluating
   practitioners' perspectives working in the Greater London Area (GLA).
   Design/methodology/approach The paper outlines the general status quo of
   BIM adoption and maturity in the UK. It then discusses the feasibility
   of BIM use in residential projects drawing on an online survey and
   complementary semi-structured interviews with building professionals.
   The cross-comparison between the evidence base and literature review
   uncovers the specific benefits, challenges and risks to BIM
   implementation in the house building sector. Findings BIM is an
   evaluation methodology that helps the management of digital information
   throughout the project lifecycle. At a conceptual level, a BIM-enabled
   project offers quality assurance and on-time delivery, collaboration and
   communication improvement, visual representation and clash detection and
   whole lifecycle value. The findings, however, suggest that the most
   frequently reported benefits are related to collaboration and the blend
   of product (software) and process innovation, whilst lifecycle thinking
   and waste reduction are often overlooked. At present, there is
   widespread awareness on BIM but with a financial barrier to invest in
   developing digital capabilities, particularly for small- and
   medium-sized enterprises. Originality/value There are relatively few
   studies evaluating BIM perspectives in UK residential projects. This
   paper explores the feasibility and ``real-life{''} value of BIM in
   housing practice, drawing on views and experiences of building
   professionals in GLA. In particular, the research findings provide an
   evidence base evaluating the extent to which the house building industry
   has the expertise and capability to operate in a BIM environment and to
   comply with the Level 2 mandate and explore which of the generic
   barriers and drivers of BIM-readiness are more relevant to the design
   and construction of housing projects.},

Title = {Life-cycle information management using open-standard BIM},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {696-708},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a way of working with
   open-standard building information modeling (BIM), object type
   libraries, systems engineering and an Information Delivery Manual for
   the management of information over the life-cycle of infrastructure
   assets. The concept is presented as a source of inspiration, proof of
   concept and to underpin the value of different parts of the concept
   leading to an integrated approach to life-cycle information management.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a concept for a way of
   working. A proof of concept is provided in the form of a case study in
   which this concept is operational. It shows that this way of working
   using open-standard BIM can be applied to manage information in the
   life-cycle. It does not provide, nor suggest to provide, empirical
   evidence for specific benefits in terms of efficiency.
   Findings - The paper shows that open-standard BIM can be applied for
   information management in the life-cycle of (construction) assets. The
   specific approach that is applied in practice in a Dutch Infrastructure
   Project is explained including a case project.
   Research limitations/implications - The example of Traverse Dieren
   attests to a implementation of the approach in practice. From this case
   it can be concluded that the suggested approach is feasible in the
   initiation and design phase and applicable during realization. Based on
   the example as described in this paper it cannot be concluded to what
   extent the known information management problems in the life-cycle are
   solved. Therefore a detailed evaluation on the information exchange
   would be required which is beyond the scope of this paper.
   Practical implications - This paper shows how different (theoretical)
   concepts are successfully combined and implemented in practice to attain
   the defined BIM goals.
   Originality/value - This paper shows a practical case implementation of
   open-standard BIM (using COINS). It provides a way of working that
   combines BIM, systems engineering, libraries and contractual
   arrangements for the management of information over the life-cycle of
   infrastructure assets.},

Title = {Multi-level assessment for embodied carbon of buildings using
   multi-source industry foundation classes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The building industry produces a large number of carbon emissions,
   causing the intensification of the greenhouse effect. Utilizing building
   information modeling (BIM) is an excellent way to assess embodied
   carbon, but the incompatibility from multi-resource heterogeneous BIM
   software ob-structs this process. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   six-step methodology for calculating embod-ied carbon based on industry
   foundation classes (IFC). This method's multi-level calculation also
   provides a transparent process under the building, domain, element, bill
   of quantity, and re-source level, which is beneficial for impartial
   carbon audits. Based on this methodology, an inno-vative IFC tool,
   NMBIM, is developed to automate this process. Furthermore, this research
   uses a campus building with comprehensive spatial and temporal
   boundaries to verify the above methodology and tool. The life cycle
   embodied carbon of the case building is simulated by di-rectly using
   existing multi-resource heterogeneous BIM models at the design stage,
   reducing from 837.23 kgCO2-e/m2 to 727.08 kgCO2-e/m2. This study extends
   the BIM-based embodied carbon assessment from the single source to
   multi-source heterogeneity. The high-quality data-sharing solution
   effectively reuses heterogeneous BIM models to quickly assess and
   optimize embodied carbon in multi-participant collaborative works.},

Title = {Whole Life Carbon Assessment of Buildings: The Process to Define Czech
   National Benchmarks},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in addressing
   human-induced impacts on the environment, with a particular focus on
   transitioning to sustainability and achieving carbon neutrality.
   However, the current implementation of Whole Life Carbon (WLC) and Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the construction sector in the Czech Republic
   is hindered by several challenges. These include gaps in stakeholders'
   knowledge, limited availability of LCA data on construction products and
   buildings, insufficient market incentives, and low institutional
   capacity. This study, conducted as part of the INDICATE project, aims to
   streamline the process of WLC calculation and establish a consistent
   national assessment method specific to the Czech context. The project
   encompasses various phases, i.e., a case study collection of office,
   multi-family, single-family, education, and logistic hall buildings,
   followed by the development of a comprehensive unified materials
   database, classification of building parts and uniform work with the
   bill of quantities, stakeholder engagement, an LCA of case studies with
   a sensitivity analysis, and WLC policy suggestions, including the
   quality of the project data, simplifications, and a benchmarks
   definition. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is calculated throughout
   the entire life cycle of each considered building, utilizing the EU
   Level(s) methodology incorporated in the OneClick LCA software. By
   adhering to these newly developed methodological steps, benchmarks for
   multi-residential buildings are shown. The same methodology could be
   replicated by stakeholders in other countries to enhance their
   evaluation processes and ensure consistent results across their
   projects.},

Title = {BIM as Infrastructure in a Finnish HVAC Actor Network: Enabling
   Adoption, Reuse, and Recombination over a Building Life Cycle and
   between Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper investigates how sociotechnical actions such as adoption,
   reuse, and recombination of designs and processes enable the users of
   building information modeling (BIM) tools to not only achieve
   productivity improvements in particular activities, but to build system
   capability that enables new ways of working. The evolution of BIM as
   digital infrastructure is studied in a network of companies developing
   and using BIM tools for new ways of working in the Finnish HVAC
   industry. The research methodology is a deductive case study testing a
   theoretical framework derived from the literature. The main finding is
   that BIM has emerged as digital infrastructure in design and
   construction, while development has stalled in use and operations. The
   explanation for the successful outcome in design and construction is
   found in the evidence of three sociotechnical actions of adoption,
   reuse, and recombination activating self-reinforcing positive
   developments in design and construction. The stalled development in use
   and operations is explained by a lack of adoption and reuse, which in
   turn inhibits the tool and process development required for increasing
   adoption. Servitization by extending project duration and aligning the
   business of actors to life cycle performance, standardization of
   interfaces and processes, and open architectures are identified as
   actions to activate digital infrastructure evolution for the later life
   cycle stages of a building. The originality and value of the paper is to
   demonstrate how the theoretical framework of sociotechnical action
   explains the emergence of BIM as digital infrastructure and how findings
   can be applied to identify specific management interventions to enable
   more successful outcomes. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Sustainability-led design: Feasibility of incorporating whole-life cycle
   energy assessment into BIM for refurbishment projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Growing climate change challenges and increasingly strict sustainability
   standards have led to a significant growth in the need for building
   refurbishment projects which are essentially focused on retrofitting in
   order to make them low carbon, energy efficient and environmentally
   friendly. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) suggested that
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) should be used to achieve
   sustainability requirements during refurbishment projects as a
   correspondence to the National Audit Office (NAO) sustainability report.
   BIM is now widely advocated as the preferred tool for the management and
   co-ordination of design and construction data using object- oriented
   principles. The successful integration of environmental assessment into
   BIM for the whole of the construction lifecycle has not yet been
   achieved. The potential for using BIM in refurbishment projects
   specifically for achieving and managing sustainability requirements has
   not been yet critically reviewed or put into practice. This paper
   focuses on the use of BIM sustainability design tools in refurbishment
   projects, to achieve energy efficient buildings and achieve
   sustainability criteria for refurbishing non-domestic buildings. A
   critical lens is cast on the current literature in the domains of
   sustainable designs and the associated implications of the
   sustainability decision-support tools in BIM. The research also reviews
   the practicality of the existing sustainability decision-support tools
   that are currently used to assist with achieving environmental scheme
   certifications such as BREEAM and LEED for refurbishment projects.},

   Waste Management in Australia: A Research Agenda},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Construction and demolition waste (C\&DW) contribute to approximately
   30\% of the total waste generation worldwide, by which heterogeneous
   ecological impacts, such as resource depletion, global warming, and land
   degradation, are engendered. Despite ongoing research efforts to
   minimize construction waste via the Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)-aided design, there is a paucity of research on integrating BIM in
   demolition waste management (DWM). This study investigates prominent
   barriers and future research directions toward the wider adoption of BIM
   in C\&DWM by conducting a systematic literature review. First, this
   study identifies the barriers that hinder the implementation of C\&DWM
   in Australia; then, it explores the benefits and challenges of
   leveraging BIM applications for C\&DWM. The findings suggest that, for
   existing buildings without up-to-date design drawings, it is imperative
   to improve the accuracy of data capturing and object recognition
   techniques to overcome the bottlenecks of BIM-DWM integration. Moreover,
   the development of regional-oriented material banks and their
   harmonization with life cycle assessment databases can extend the
   potential of BIM-based sustainability analysis, making it applicable to
   the DWM domain. This study proposes a research agenda on tackling these
   challenges to realize BIM's full potential in facilitating DWM.},

Abstract = {Within this work, life cycle assessment modeling is used to determine
   top design priorities and quantitatively inform sustainable design
   decision-making for a prefabricated modular building. A case-study
   life-cycle assessment was performed for a 5,000 ft(2) prefabricated
   commercial building constructed in San Francisco, California, and
   scenario analysis was run examining the life cycle environmental impacts
   of various energy and material design substitutions, and a structural
   design change. Results show that even for a highly energy-efficient
   modular building, the top design priority is still minimizing
   operational energy impacts, since this strongly dominates the building
   life cycle's environmental impacts. However, as an energy-efficient
   building approaches net zero energy, manufacturing-phase impacts are
   dominant, and a new set of design priorities emerges. Transportation and
   end-of-life disposal impacts were of low to negligible importance in
   both cases.},

   uses of BIM and their main problems will constitute a foundation for an
   intervention. We will focus on the following questions: (1) How
   different partners use the composite BIM model? (2) What are the major
   contradictions or problems in the BIM use? The preliminary findings
   reported in this study show that BIM has been adopted quite generally to
   design use but the old ways of collaboration seem to prevail, especially
   between designers and between designers and building sites. BIM has
   provided new means and demands for collaboration but expansive uses of
   BIM for providing new interactive processes across professional fields
   have not much come true.},

   design to commissioning and beyond A critical review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {265},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) constitutes the state of the art in
   the digital design techniques, and represents one of the main streams of
   the Industry 4.0 era. The integration of BIM into processes related to
   buildings design, construction and operation is a practice in line with
   the sustainability aspects of the built environment, and which gains
   more interest in the recent years in the field of research development.
   This study aspires to present the main advancements in the field of
   building integration modelling in the field of smart buildings. Emphasis
   is given on the integration of IoT applications into buildings smart
   operations. The study is structured in four sections, concerning the use
   of BIM in pre-, during- and post-construction life cycles of the
   project, as well as for other significant aspects. In the
   pre-construction stage, research trends in the field of building design
   and optimization, as well as for the environmental assessment of
   buildings' design with the use of BIM and LCA tools is presented. Issues
   related to the use of BIM for monitoring and coordination during
   construction, as well as for health and safety topics in the
   construction site are also analysed. An overview of recent studies in
   the area of applications for buildings smart operation with the use of
   IoT technologies, as well as for renovation projects, are considered in
   the analysis of the post-construction applications of BIM.
   Interoperability issues concerning data sharing between BIM related
   applications is presented, according to the recent advancements in
   standardization processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper comprehensively addresses the life cycle of the building,
   from data requirement and verification to its storage, integrating
   construction, warranty, and maintenance management within BIM
   interoperability. Facilitating information management and making it
   available for the operation and maintenance phase enables the flow of
   information exchange between stakeholders. The benefits obtained from
   addressing these BIM interoperability issues are demonstrated with an
   example of an actual project. The most significant contribution of this
   article is the creation of a structure that addresses the life cycle of
   the building. The system allows the use of geometric and non-geometric
   information to enhance visual alerts along the flow of information
   exchange between stakeholders for small projects and residential
   buildings since it does not tackle space planning management. Among the
   contributions, the information flow has been detailed for the correct
   process functioning, and a suggested flowchart for project development
   emphasizes facilities management.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a stochastic service life cycle analysis to gauge
   where a service is in its life cycle and to give forecasts about its
   future prospects. We employ customer review data to measure
   customer-oriented service maturity and use a hidden Markov model to
   estimate the probability of a service being at a certain stage of its
   life cycle. Based on this, we also develop three indicators to represent
   the future prospects of a service's life cycle progression. The main
   advantages of the proposed approach lie in its ability to model
   different shapes of life cycles without any supplementary information
   and to examine a wide range of services at acceptable levels of time and
   cost. We believe our method will assist firms in building
   stage-customised post-launch service strategies. A case study of mobile
   game services in the Apple App Store is presented.},

Title = {Common data environments in construction: state-of-the-art and
   challenges for practical implementation},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 29},
Abstract = {Purpose-Information management workflow in building information
   modelling (BIM)-based collaboration is based on using a common data
   environment (CDE). The basic premise of a CDE is exposing all relevant
   data as a single source of truth and facilitating continuous
   collaboration between stakeholders. A multitude of tools can be used as
   a CDE, however, it is not clear how the tools are used or if they fulfil
   the users' needs. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate current
   practices of using CDEs for information management during the whole
   built asset's life cycle, through a state-of-the-art literature review
   and an empirical study. Design/methodology/approach-Literature data is
   collected according to the PRISMA 2020 guideline for reporting
   systematic reviews. This paper includes 46 documents in the review and
   conduct a bibliometric and thematic analysis to identify the main
   challenges of digital information management. To understand the current
   practice and the views of the stakeholders using CDEs in their work,
   this paper used an empirical approach including semi-structured
   interviews with 15 BIM experts. Findings-The results indicate that one
   of the major challenges of CDE adoption is project complexity and using
   multiple CDEs simultaneously leading to data accountability,
   transparency and reliability issues. To tackle those challenges, the use
   of novel technologies in CDE development such as blockchain could be
   further investigated. Originality/value-The research explores the major
   challenges in the practical implementation of CDEs for information
   management. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   study on this topic combining a systematic literature review and
   fieldwork.},

Abstract = {Mega projects delivering rail infrastructure are constantly seeking
   cost-effective and efficient technologies to sustain the growing
   population. Building information modeling (BIM) and BIM for cost
   management (5D-BIM) have shown great potential in the building industry
   and have been adopted widely. However, 5D-BIM implementation in rail
   infrastructure is still in its infancy. This paper presents a systematic
   literature review of 380 publications related to cost overrun, cost
   management and 5D-BIM for rail infrastructure, including rail projects.
   The review identified knowledge gaps and synthesized existing research
   on cost overrun in rail projects, cost estimation models, and the
   current use of 5D-BIM. The review revealed that there is no current
   study integrating 5D-BIM into the rail project lifecycle. This paper
   highlights the importance of integrating 5D-BIM systematically in the
   rail project life cycle to avoid/minimize cost overrun. The review
   provides researchers and practitioners with crucial information for
   deploying 5D-BIM to minimize cost overruns in rail projects.},

Abstract = {Buildings are considered major drivers of resource use and climate
   change. This has initiated the development of design tools that could
   better reflect the environmental performance of buildings. This article
   describes the extension of building information modelling (BIM) through
   the development of the sustainable resource application (SURAP) that can
   be used to determine the material, water, and climate footprints of
   buildings at the design stage. The Python application programming
   interface (API) of openLCA software was used with the GaBi construction
   materials database for the preparation of footprint data. Footprints of
   construction materials were determined through life cycle assessments
   (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis, and the application was developed as a
   new tab in the Autodesk Revit software. The Revit API was used for data
   exchange between the Revit core system and the developed plug-in. The
   application prototype was tested for the design of a multifamily
   building. The results show that the developed tool can support building
   designers in quantifying and visualizing cradle-to-gate material, water,
   and the climate footprints of buildings within the BIM environment. The
   promotion of sustainability in the building industry and its current
   limitations are discussed.},

Title = {Parametric BIM-based life cycle assessment framework for optimal

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The construction sector is liable for a sizable amount of CO2 emissions
   and waste. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered one of the crucial
   tools that aids in evaluating the impacts of construction emissions.
   This research aims to quantify the life cycle impacts of the initial and
   recurrent embodied emissions, operating and reuse/disposal emissions,
   and utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) for a more holistic
   life cycle approach. The research proposes a parametric BIM-based LCA
   framework for quantifying the environmental impacts and evaluating the
   effects of material selection for both embodied and operating emissions.
   In addition, it considers the different reuse scenarios and percentages
   and their effect on both the embodied and operating impacts. The
   proposed framework consists of five main modules: data acquisition
   module, operating and embodied emissions module, life cycle assessment
   module, optimization module, and decision-making module. This parametric
   assessment can be applied for both the conventional and circular
   approach impacts. For the decision-making process, the resulting
   emissions are optimized utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and evaluated through an LCA and Data Envelopment
   Analysis (DEA) methodology for the material selection. A case study of a
   residential villa in Cairo is worked out to illustrate the key features
   of the proposed framework. This assessment analyzes the building
   materials' characteristics and efficiency investigating the external
   walls, internal walls, floors, roofs, and windows design possibilities,
   and uses visual programming to control the resulting emissions for a
   more flexible approach. By comparing the integrated LCA and DEA models
   three optimum design solutions, the conventional approach develops
   design solutions of higher embodied Global Warming Potential (GWP) than
   the circular approach. However, it develops lower operating GWP with
   better applied U-values. The circularity approach employment has reduced
   the efficiency of the operating GWP due to utilizing materials with high
   heat transmittance ability.},

Abstract = {The construction industry's rapid growth significantly impacts energy
   consumption and environmental health. It is crucial to develop
   optimization strategies to enhance green building energy efficiency and
   encompass comprehensive analysis methods. This study aims to introduce
   and validate a novel framework for optimizing energy efficiency design
   in green buildings by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   technology, Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis, and orthogonal testing
   methods, focusing on enhancing energy efficiency and reducing life cycle
   costs. The optimization parameters for the building envelope are
   identified by analyzing energy consumption components and key green
   building factors. The orthogonal testing method was applied to
   streamline design options. Building Energy Consumption Simulation (BECS)
   software and LCC analysis tools were employed to calculate each
   optimized option's total annual energy consumption and the current life
   cycle costs. Using the efficiency coefficient method, each optimization
   scheme's energy consumption and economic indicators were thoroughly
   analyzed. The framework's validity and applicability were confirmed
   through an empirical analysis of a campus green building case in Fujian
   Province, demonstrating that the optimized framework could reduce energy
   consumption by 4.85 kWh/m(2) per year and lower costs by 38.89 Yuan/m(2)
   compared to the reference building. The case study highlights the
   framework's significant benefits in enhancing environmental performance
   and economic gains. The results provide critical parameter selection and
   offer scientific and technological support for the design of building
   energy efficiency, promoting optimization techniques and sustainable
   development within the construction industry.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {China's urban housing demand has directly influenced urbanization
   development. To stabilize the level of urbanization, it is urgent to
   optimize the whole life-cycle efficiency of construction and the
   preliminary design as the first step is even more significant. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) is widely used as information technology in
   the construction industry to promote the implementation and management
   of projects. However, the traditional preliminary design approach still
   occupies the mainstream market without forming a systematic BIM
   workflow, which causes inefficiency. To address this issue, this
   research aims to construct a BIM-assisted workflow to enhance the
   preliminary design efficiency of architecture. This study creates
   traditional and BIM-assisted workflows for comparative analysis to
   capture duration data with a questionnaire and validate by practical
   simulation. The findings show that the BIM-assisted workflow consumes
   less time than the traditional workflow. This research indicates that
   the BIM-assisted workflow can significantly reduce operation time to
   enhance preliminary design efficiency and deserves to be strongly
   promoted in the Chinese Architecture, Engineering, and Construction
   (AEC) industry.},

Title = {BIM-based approach for the integrated assessment of life cycle carbon
   emission intensity and life cycle costs},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {226},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The construction industry is well known for generating a large amount of
   carbon emissions and this, together with huge costs of buildings during
   their life cycle, seriously affects its environmental and economic
   sustain -ability. That reducing the former tends to increase the latter
   is a highly significant problem exacerbating the situation. Finding a
   solution with the lowest carbon emission at a certain cost is an urgent
   problem to be solved. Research to date aimed at remedying the situation,
   however, has been largely focused on either treating the two issues
   independently or partially conjoined, with little progress in their
   integrated assessment. In response, this study presents a method for
   integrating the life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) and life cycle costs
   (LCC) of buildings to assess their life cycle carbon emission intensity
   (CEI) based on BIM technology. Through a public building in China as a
   case study, the feasibility of the method is verified, the key stages of
   building carbon emissions are analyzed using CEI, and the conversion of
   high carbon emission materials to low carbon emission materials is
   explored. The proposed methodology and framework provide solutions and
   ideas for achieving optimal costs commensurate with low carbon emissions
   throughout the building life cycle, facilitating the assessment of
   carbon emissions at the decision-making and design stages, achieving the
   optimization of building carbon emissions and costs, and enhancing
   building life cycle sustainability.},

Abstract = {New urbanization approaches aligned with public-private partnership
   (PPP) which arose in the early 1990s, have become acceptable and even
   better solutions to outstanding urban municipal constructions. However,
   PPPs are still problematic regarding value for money (VFM) process which
   is the main driving force to deliver public services. The current VFM
   structure requires an integrated platform to manage multi-performance
   and collaborative relationship in project life-cycles. Building
   information modelling (BIM), a popular approach to the procurement in
   AEC sectors, provides the potential to ensure VFM while also working in
   tandem with the semantic approach to holistically measure the life cycle
   performance. This paper suggests that KM applied to the PPP life cycle
   could support decision-making regarding VFM and thus meet service
   targets.},

Abstract = {By 2050, the building sector has to become nearly CO2-neutral in order
   to achieve the climate protection targets of the Paris agreement. This
   tremendous challenge can only be met by taking the carbon neutrality
   into consideration from the early stages of the planning processes. The
   overall aim of the project is to provide a life cycle analysis
   throughout the entire planning and construction process of a building
   with a special focus on CO2-neutrality. To this end, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) is an appropriate method. The project aims to
   close the gap between specialist consultants and BIM applications. For
   that, relevant data for cost estimation, scheduling construction
   planning and management or sustainable building aspects, shall be added
   automatically to BIM elements. This data exchange shall be carried out
   using open BIM and IFC interface according to ONORM A6241-2 via a
   central platform, the ``6D BIM Terminal{''}. For more complex
   calculations the respective specialist planning software shall be made
   ready to exchange data in IFC format. Thus, life cycle analyses and life
   cycle cost assessment, as well as specifications for tender, can be
   performed on the basis of the building model. The expected results of
   the project are as follows:

   impacts utilising BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In recent years advances in digital tools have been leading the way in
   the construction of cleaner, more energy-efficient buildings.
   Furthermore, improvements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have
   resulted in various tools being used to assess building performance and
   overall Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This work offers a unique insight
   into the development of a parametric LCA BIM tool, focusing on both
   operational and embodied energy perspectives through case study analysis
   of a commercial and a domestic building in the UK. A mixed research
   method was employed combining a literature review, qualitative and
   quantitative LCA case study analysis, and parametric modelling. The
   results indicate that embodied energy is much more critical in the early
   stages of the building's life, then is quickly overtaken by operational
   energy. In addition, many variations exist in energy outputs between
   domestic and commercial buildings. Operational energy takes a
   significant share in domestic buildings compared to commercial
   buildings. These variations are attributed to different design methods,
   construction materials, occupancy patterns and energy demands. The study
   proposes an LCA-BIM interactive user-led method of addressing energy
   hotspots for both operational and embodied elements, which can provide
   more instant identification of energy critical areas. Such an approach
   can offer real alternative BIM-based analysis tools during the design
   stages, compared to those currently being used, which focus mainly on
   either LCA of operational or embodied energy.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Abstract = {The innovation of building information modelling (BIM) technology
   provides a new means of predicting, managing and monitoring the
   environmental impacts of project construction and development through
   virtual prototyping/visualisation technology. This paper aims to provide
   thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the
   existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important
   directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers
   have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on
   environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction
   stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on
   the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental
   performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers),
   and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a
   `one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and
   management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in
   future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three
   R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis
   for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should
   offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for
   more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM
   technology to enable the management of building sustainability using
   `big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is
   argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM
   models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Uncertainties evaluation is increasingly gaining traction within life
   cycle assessment (LCA), due to its key role as environmental decision
   support tool. When applied at wholebuilding scale, the large variety of
   materials, subjective choices and long lifespans introduce parameter,
   scenario and model uncertainties throughout the life cycle. Since
   normative choices are unavoidable within whole-building LCA (wbLCA), in
   this article we carried out a so-called `scenario' uncertainty
   assessment for one illustrative case study. First, three uncertainty
   sources were selected, to include the two drivers most frequently cited
   in literature (reference service life and end of life management
   alternatives) and material wastage, a relevant issue to factor in
   variable construction optimization levels in contexts like Brazil.
   Cumulative energy demand (CED) and CML 2001 v.2.05 methods were used for
   calculating deterministic values of non-renewable embodied energy and
   global warming potential in SimaPro 7.3 The uncertainty assessment
   combined scenario analysis, stochastic modelling (Monte Carlo simulation
   of triangular probability distributions for the uncertainty drivers
   investigated) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The GSA confirmed
   the dominant contribution of the operational phase strongly influenced
   by components replacement rate - to of life cycle non-renewable embodied
   energy and global warming potential result variance, whilst construction
   and end of life stages showed no correlation with life cycle results.
   Findings from this research also highlight the strategic importance of
   gathering service life information adherent to the assessed context.
   Building components replacement rates induced by the Brazilian standard
   are overestimated relatively to international figures used in LCAs
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {For next-generation buildings, continuous commissioning over the
   life-cycle is essential. In particular, Japanese buildings, which are
   exposed to recent extreme climate fluctuations and natural disasters,
   are required to ensure indoor thermal comfort, even under various
   situations. For this reason, recent HVAC\&R-systems are often
   complicated because they need to be flexibly changed according to
   various situations. Furthermore, demands for HVAC\&R-systems have been
   diversifying in response to advances in work styles and IT systems,
   improvements in building performance, and user demands. In order to
   optimally plan and operate such a complex HVAC\&R-system, it is
   important to perform commissioning in each life-cycle phase of design,
   construction, and operation. It is also important to make the operation
   method of the HVAC\&R-system easy to understand, to convey it to
   building users. In recent years, virtual visualization of building
   models has been rapidly developed by BIM, which can unify information
   from design to construction and operation. In Japan, it is used from
   design through construction, and it is currently being sought to use it
   as an operation tool, to communicate the design intent. In this paper, a
   case study of a tenant office building in Tokyo is described, where
   commissioning from the design stage to the operation stage was
   performed. This process made full use of BIM and simulation that can be
   used during the entire life-cycle of the building.},

Volume = {132},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools have emerged as
   decision-making support for BIM practitioners during the design stage of
   sustainable projects. However, differences between methodologies applied
   for determining the environmental impact of buildings produce
   significant variations in the results obtained, making them difficult to
   be compared. In this study, a methodology is defined for generating
   environmental benchmarks for building typologies through a combination
   of BIM-based LCA tools and machine learning techniques. When applied to
   an 11-story residential building typology with 92 dwellings by varying
   the constructive solutions of facades, partitions, roof and thermal
   insulation materials, results fall within a range from 360 to 430
   kgCO(2)eq/m(2). The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is successfully applied
   for identifying the most decisive variables in the analysis (partitions
   and facades), and shows signs of being useful for predicting the
   environmental impact of future constructions and to be applied to the
   analysis of greater scale urban zones.},

Abstract = {The physical adaptability of buildings is very important in today's
   fast-changing business environment. The actors who invest in long-term
   adaptability are positioned better to the changes during the life cycle
   of a building. This conceptual paper argues that the current dominating
   real estate (property) investment analysis theories do not accommodate
   enough building design-related information (i.e. physical asset
   characteristics), which results in long-term loss of competitiveness and
   unsustainable use of built environment resources. It is demonstrated
   that physical asset characteristics can create valuable real options
   that should be acknowledged in real estate investment analysis and
   management. The real estate investment literature has not so far been
   able to produce a widely accepted financial model for justifying
   life-cycle investments. A theory is proposed here that can be used to
   value life-cycle investments in buildings. This new theory combines of
   real options valuation, investment analysis and building component
   life-cycle design. These themes are used to formulate a conceptual
   framework for valuing life-cycle investments. The framework is intuitive
   and transparent, and it can be easily added to current spreadsheet
   investment analysis tools.},

Title = {Multidisciplinary Optimization of Life-Cycle Energy and Cost Using a
   BIM-Based Master Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Virtual design tools and methods can aid in creating decision bases, but
   it is a challenge to balance all the trade-offs between different
   disciplines in building design. Optimization methods are at hand, but
   the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain
   models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one
   source instead of having several unconnected product definitions.
   Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing
   the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability
   between models from different domains and previous research reports on
   different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent
   research features BIM-based optimization, but there is still a question
   of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats
   to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost.
   This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary
   optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model,
   from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and
   evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the
   optimization loop. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was
   developed and used in a case study of a Swedish multifamily residential
   building to test the framework's applicability in generating and
   optimizing multiple models based on the BIM-model. The prototype was
   developed to enhance the building's sustainability performance by
   optimizing the trade-off between the building's life-cycle energy (LCE)
   and life-cycle cost (LCC) when choosing material for the envelope. The
   results of the case study demonstrated the applicability of the
   framework and prototype in optimizing the trade-off between conflicting
   objectives, such as LCE and LCC, during the design process.},

Title = {Trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in BIM-LCA integration},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 14},
Abstract = {PurposeIn the last decades, various building information modeling-life
   cycle assessment (BIM-LCA) integration approaches have been developed to
   assess the environmental impact of the built asset. However, there is a
   lack of consensus on the optimal BIM-LCA integration approach that
   provides the most accurate and efficient assessment outcomes. To compare
   and determine their accuracy and efficiency, this study aimed to
   investigate four typical BIM-LCA integration solutions, namely,
   conventional, parametric modeling, plug-in and industry foundation
   classes (IFC)-based integration.Design/methodology/approachThe four
   integration approaches were developed and applied using the same
   building project. A quantitative technique for evaluating the accuracy
   and efficiency of BIM-LCA integration solutions was used. Four
   indicators for assessing the performance of BIM-LCA integration were (1)
   validity of LCA results, (2) accuracy of bill-of-quantity (BOQ)
   extraction, (3) time for developing life cycle inventories (i.e.
   developing time) and (4) time for calculating LCA results (i.e.
   calculation time).FindingsThe results show that the plug-in-based
   approach outperforms others in developing and calculation time, while
   the conventional one could derive the most accuracy in BOQ extraction
   and result validity. The parametric modeling approach outperforms the
   IFC-based method regarding BOQ extraction, developing time and
   calculation time. Despite this, the IFC-based approach produces LCA
   outcomes with approximately 1\% error, proving its
   validity.Originality/valueThis paper forms one of the first studies that
   employ a quantitative and objective method to determine the performance
   of four typical BIM-LCA integration solutions and reveal the trade-offs
   between the accuracy and efficiency of the integration approaches. The
   findings provide practical references for LCA practitioners to select
   appropriate BIM-LCA integration approaches for evaluating the
   environmental impact of the built asset during the design phase.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the U.S., about 50\% of total CO2 emissions stem from
   the built environment (e.g., building construction, operation {[}
   heating, lighting, cooling], and end-of-life) (EPA 2012). Improving the
   performance and efficiency of the built environment offers the largest
   and least cost GHG mitigation option of any sector of the global economy
   (IPCC 2007). Science-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are
   increasingly being used to analyse the environmental impact of
   construction materials and products.
   Objectives: This paper presents a framework for LCA-based environmental
   decision making for commercial buildings at the conceptual design phase,
   compares it to the currently available LCA tools and data bases, and
   identifies the ``next steps{''} in developing a comprehensive LCA
   standard for assessing whole building life cycles to support
   environmental decision making in design and construction.
   Methodology/approach: 1) CSU/AIA conducted focus groups in 8 US cities
   to explore actual and potential use of LCA in decision making by
   architects; 2) A framework created based on feedback from focus groups,
   3) The framework was compared to existing LCA tools and databases, 4)
   Gaps were identified for next stages in developing an LCA-based
   environmental decision-making tool for conceptual design.
   Findings and contributions: 1) Current LCA tools are balkanized and
   usually address only one life cycle stage, material or system in a
   building. 2) LCA-related databases normally only address materials and
   product; they do not address construction activities or building
   operations. 3) LCA tools and databases generally require a completely
   separate activity, data input and expertise; they are not integrated
   into routinely used architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   tools, methods or best practices. 4) LCA based decision-making will not
   become an AEC best practice until it is fully integrated, comprehensive,
   standardized, affordable, and demanded by customers and municipalities.

Title = {Embodied and operational energy for new-build housing: A case study of
   construction methods in the UK},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {479-488},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study a Building Information Model (BIM) tool is developed to
   simultaneously estimate embodied and operational carbon over a 60 year
   life span for a typical four bedroom detached house. Using the tool,
   four different construction scenarios are evaluated, representing a
   range of current construction methods used in present day UK house
   building. The results show that cradle-to-gate embodied carbon
   represents 20-26\% of the total 60 year carbon emissions, with
   operational carbon representing 74-80\% of total emissions. Construction
   scenarios that reduce operational carbon by improving the thermal
   envelope led to a 1-13\% increase in embodied carbon but a 4-5\%
   decrease in operational carbon compared to the basecase construction
   method. Approaches to reduce embodied carbon in new-build housing are
   also studied and a 24\% reduction is demonstrated through building
   fabric changes. The study recommends that a universally robust
   methodology for measuring embodied carbon will enable design decisions
   to be taken to reduce whole life carbon emissions through improved
   choice of materials. Due to material changes impacting on the thermal
   characteristics of a dwelling, and to an extent the structural
   characteristics, an integrated BIM tool will be essential in quickly
   establishing whole life carbon impacts during the design stage. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The building physical entity (BPE) could produce a series of unstable
   dynamic changes under the influence of highly complex internal and
   external loads. However, the building information model (BIM) used in
   the current construction industry is difficult to simulate this change.
   In our previous work, we proposed a foundation model for building
   digital twins (BDTFM), which constructing the building digital twins
   based on it could replace BIM to solve the above difficulties. However,
   the BDTFM only gives the functional description of BDTs at the
   conceptual level and does not give specific technical methods to
   simulate the dynamic changes of BPE. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   knowledge-data-based hybrid model to drive BDTs to implementation
   self-evolution and dynamic optimization, realize intelligent reasoning
   and autonomous decision-making, to achieve the purpose of simulating the
   dynamic changes of BPE in the whole life cycle. At last, giving a case
   of foundation pit settlement prediction of an underdrain to illustrate
   how the theory proposed in this paper could be applied to practical
   engineering.},

Title = {Integration of Emergy Analysis with Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Traditional energy analysis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) only
   accounts for the energy requirements of building operations during a
   portion of the occupancy phase of the building's life cycle and as such
   is unable to quantify the true impact of buildings on the environment.
   Specifically, the typical energy analysis in BIM does not account for
   the energy associated with resource formation, recycling, and
   demolition. Therefore, a comprehensive method is required to analyze the
   true environmental impact of buildings. Emergy analysis can offer a
   holistic approach to account for the environmental cost of activities
   involved in building construction and operation in all its life cycle
   phases from resource formation to demolition. As such, the integration
   of emergy analysis with BIM can result in the development of a holistic
   sustainability performance tool. Therefore, this study aimed at
   developing a comprehensive framework for the integration of emergy
   analysis with existing Building Information Modeling tools. The proposed
   framework was validated using a case study involving a test building
   element of 8' x 8' composite wall. The case study demonstrated the
   successful integration of emergy analysis with Revit(R)2021 using the
   inbuilt features of Revit and external tools such as MS Excel. The
   framework developed in this study will help in accurately determining
   the environmental cost of the buildings, which will help in selecting
   environment-friendly building materials and systems. In addition, the
   integration of emergy into BIM will allow a comparison of various built
   environment alternatives enabling designers to make sustainable
   decisions during the design phase.},

Title = {A dynamic life cycle assessment model for long-term carbon emissions
   prediction of buildings: A passive building as case study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {96},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon emissions of buildings in the life cycle are huge due to the high
   resource-intensive and energy con-sumption of the buildings industry and
   its upstream industries. And for carbon emissions prediction of the
   buildings, the life cycle assessment (LCA) with the static parameters
   input was used to obtain long-term carbon emissions for the buildings in
   the existed studies. The study presented a dynamic LCA model to predict
   life cycle carbon emissions of the buildings and optimize the insulation
   parameter with the improved temporal validation of upstream parameters.
   A case passive building was selected to perform the dynamic method based
   on the basic and operational information of this building. The key
   temporal parameters were collected and predicted via grey prediction.
   And the electric mix structure was predicted via scenario analysis
   method. The dynamic life cycle carbon emissions of energy systems were
   evaluated in different scenarios by the combination of predicting
   results and historical data. The life cycle carbon emissions of the case
   building in temporal scenarios reduced approx-imately 23.4\% of that in
   static scenario. Also, optimal insulation layer thickness in temporal
   scenarios of and that in static scenario were 130 mm, 120 mm and 250 mm,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Typically, in simulating the dynamic processes in buildings, data
   modeling efforts require the modeling of the building geometry, its
   components and the relationship between these components, as well as the
   modeling of the process that is under study. For example, in simulating
   the life cycle of a building, one must simulate the flow of materials as
   well as the flow of information as part of the process modeling, while a
   component model is needed to represent the building as an artefact. A
   third aspect of this modeling effort constitutes the simulation of human
   intervention, i.e. the decision process that might affect the nature of
   the building itself as well as the process that acts upon it. For
   example, the decision to remodel a certain component clearly affects
   both the component itself as well as the process of aging, when the life
   cycle of buildings is simulated. This paper looks at the data modeling
   requirements of the simulation of building life cycle within the context
   of the three parameters mentioned above: data model for buildings,
   process models, and decision models. Temporal issues in data modeling,
   such as versioning for components, keeping track of data that are
   related to change and remodeling, and buildings as temporal-spatial
   entities for life cycle analysis purposes are also addressed. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate factors that impede
   the integration of facilities management (FM) into building information
   modeling (BIM) technology. The use of BIM technology in the commercial
   construction industry has grown enormously in recent years. Its
   application to FM, however, is still limited. The literature highlights
   issues that hinder BIM-FM integration, which are studied and discussed
   in detail in this paper. Design/methodology/approach A review of
   literature is conducted to identify and categorize key issues hampering
   the application of BIM to FM. This paper has also designed a
   questionnaire based on a literature review and surveyed FM professionals
   at two industry events. Using the collected responses, these issues are
   analyzed and discussed using non-parametric statistical analyses.
   Findings A total of 16 issues are identified through the literature
   review of 54 studies under the four categories of BIM-execution and
   information-management, technological, cost-based and legal and
   contractual issues. The results of the survey of FM professionals (with
   57 complete responses) reveal that the single most important issue is
   the lack of FM involvement in project phases when BIM is evolving.
   Originality/value The findings of this study could assist the
   construction industry (e.g. building-material and equipment
   manufacturers, design professionals, general contractors, construction
   managers, owners and facility managers) with creating guidelines that
   would help in BIM-FM integration. BIM is a virtual database that
   contains important design and construction information, which can be
   used for effective and efficient life cycle management if building data
   are captured completely and accurately with a facility manager's
   involvement.},

Abstract = {One of the main reasons for introducing BIM into existing buildings is
   cost savings in the construction management and maintenance phase
   (operating phase). Operational phases have the biggest impact on the
   total life cycle costs. The introduction of BIM and the creation of a
   building information model, albeit at a higher price, will be
   counterbalanced several times by a more efficient way of managing the
   building during its life cycle, the possibility of creating a healthier
   indoor environment for building users and better access to necessary
   information, for example in the case of changes to completed buildings.
   The BIM model is a digital equivalent of a real construction - real
   digital twin. It contains geometric data in the form of a 3D model and
   non-geometry data, including construction management and support
   documents. The BIM model allows access to building usage information.
   The information obtained is more accurate. It keeps building element
   information up to date, enabling more informed decisions. It supports
   comparison of different solutions and their energy needs. Renovation can
   be done more efficiently. Construction information is up-to-date, so we
   can use the time needed to process different solutions instead of
   finding the necessary information about the construction.},

Abstract = {Despite a slight decrease of the number of accidents at work on German
   construction sites in recent years, prevention activities should be
   strengthened and started explicitly in addition. In particular, a large
   number of accidents on construction sites are carried out by the
   collision of different trades and the absence or not wearing appropriate
   PPE for workers of adjacent trades. An important potential is seen in
   the optimization of the safety and health by making available
   pre-defined information about safety and health throughout the life
   cycle of buildings. Using this information, preventive measures can be
   taken faster, more effective, safer and preventive. The method of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) forms the basis for a comprehensive
   building information model or building data model. From the perspective
   of the applicant the method of BIM in conjunction with the Auto-ID-based
   tracking of actual process data, however, provides additional data to
   planning data among other OSH-related processes. This data can be used
   for the further phases of the life cycle of buildings, which are in the
   building phase, the use phase and rebuilding phase and the
   decommissioning phase considerable potential, especially for the
   optimization of occupational safety and health. The primary objective of
   this research project is to identify, define and standardize health and
   safety information and provide them for preventive measures with the BIM
   method.},

Title = {Green Building Rating Systems and Whole-Building Life Cycle Assessment:
   Comparative Study of the Existing Assessment Tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is a growing interest in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA)
   into building design decision making due to LCA's comprehensive and
   systemic approach to environmental evaluation. Many green building
   rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a
   comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools
   available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for
   a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary
   in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices),
   design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA
   tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early
   design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of
   materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others
   showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the
   beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated
   that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and
   the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case
   study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational
   energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as
   increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to
   mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing
   the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the
   operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed.
   Finally, this paper examines the traditional building's systems that are
   usually involved in LCA and the possibility of adding other systems,
   such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems, using building
   information modeling (BIM). (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {Whole-building integrated design and operations can result in buildings
   that are of overall higher quality and performance throughout their
   useful life. This approach requires the repeated evaluation of building
   performance from multiple perspectives, as well as the communication Of
   evaluation results between project participants over time. The resources
   necessary for employing sophisticated simulation tools in this process
   have historically been prohibitive. The alternative of making design and
   operation decisions based on rules-of-thumb and simplified methods can
   lead to suboptimal performance. Even when individual participants do
   employ simulation, the results are seldom communicated between
   participants to assure whole-building performance across the life-cycle.
   Software interoperability proffers a partial solution to these problems
   by defining a common data model for exchanging a comprehensive set of
   building data between software tools and their users. This paper
   discusses software interoperability capable of supporting data exchange
   between project participants and their tools across the building
   life-cycle. An overview is given of the Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFC), a common data model developed by the International Alliance for
   Interoperability (IAI). A working implementation example of software
   interoperability including CAD, energy simulation, and performance
   metric tracking tools is presented within a context of life-cycle
   information management intended to support whole-building performance

Title = {Calculation of a building's life cycle carbon emissions based on Ecotect
   and building information modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Number = {1},
Pages = {453-465},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for more than 40\% of global energy usage and
   as much as 33\% of global greenhouse gas emissions in both developed and
   developing countries. However, the study of carbon emissions over a
   building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling
   in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the
   results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to
   the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that
   Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying
   the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because
   they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools
   necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may
   alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA
   of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several
   parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on
   the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon
   emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the
   largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4\% of the
   total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction
   stage accounted for 12.6\% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately
   2\% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage.
   Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the
   building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these
   findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions
   in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings.
   However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should
   not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per
   year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use
   phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The research on the application of BIM technology in architectural
   heritage is increasing. Building information modeling (BIM) makes the
   realization of architectural heritage assessment, design, and management
   systematic and effective. However, little is known about the use of
   China-based BIM in conjunction with architectural heritage. Therefore,
   this study conducted a systematic literature analysis to determine the
   application fields and development trends of BIM and architectural
   heritage research in China. A total of 186 articles were retrieved from
   CNKI, of which 167 met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of
   this systematic literature analysis. With the aid of the literature
   research visualization analysis software VOSviewer and SATI, a
   comprehensive literature visualization analysis was carried out. It was
   determined that the hot fields of BIM research in architectural heritage
   in China are mainly focused on (a) the perspective of data acquisition
   and measurement technology, (b) the perspective of model construction
   based on point cloud data acquisition, and (c) the perspective of BIM
   model application. Future research trends may focus on the information
   research of architectural heritage, combined with the application of BIM
   technology in the whole life cycle management of architectural heritage

Abstract = {The concept of FM (Facility Management) is still in the initial stage in
   China and the current FM practices has been proved to have many
   shortcomings, including incomprehensive understanding of functions, less
   FM early intervention and etc. The core of these problems is the lack of
   a life-cycle information management from the FM point in building
   projects. The introduction of BIM may pave the way for the integration
   management of life-cycle information. Based on the theory of BIM and FM,

Abstract = {Purpose Energy analysis (EA) within a building information modelling
   (BIM) enables consistent data integration in central repositories and
   eases information exchange, reducing rework. However, data loss during
   information exchange from different BIM uses or disciplines is frequent.
   Therefore, a holistic approach for different BIM uses enables a coherent
   life cycle information flow. The life cycle information flow drives the
   reduction of data loss and model rework and enhances the seamless reuse
   of information. The latter requires a specification of the EA key
   performance indicators (KPIs) and integrating those in the process.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a set of KPIs extracted
   from the developed EA process maps and interviews with expert
   stakeholders. These KPIs stem from the literature review and link to the
   benefits of EA through industry expert review. The study includes (1)
   development and validation of EA process maps adjusted to requirements
   from different stakeholders. (2) KPIs aligned with the EA process map,
   (3) identification of the drivers that can facilitate life cycle
   information exchange and (4) opportunities and obstacles for EA within
   BIM-enabled projects. Findings This paper depicts a viable alternative
   for EA process maps and KPIs in a BIM-enabled AEC design industry. The
   findings of this paper showcase the need for an EA within BIM with these
   KPIs integrated for a more effective process conforming to the current
   Open BIM Alliance guidance and contributing towards sustainable life
   cycle information flow. Research limitations/implications The limitation
   of the research is the challenge of generalising the developed EA
   process maps; however, it can be adjusted to fit defined organisational
   use. The findings deduced from the developed EA process map only show
   KPIs to have the ability to facilitate adequate information flow during
   EA. Practical implications The AEC industry will benefit from the
   findings of this primary research as the industry will be able to
   contrast its process maps and KPIs to those developed in the paper.
   Social implications This paper benefits the societal values in EA for
   the built environment in the design stages. The subsequent life cycle
   information flow will help achieve a consistent information set and
   decarbonised built environment. Originality/value The paper offers a
   practical overview of process maps and KPIs to embed EA into BIM,
   reducing the information loss and rework needed in the practice of this
   integration. The applicability of the solution is contrasted by
   consultation with experts and literature.},

Title = {The Concept of Enterprise BIM: Current Research Practice and Future
   Trends},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {42265-42290},
Abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and holistic way of
   utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) throughout a building's
   life-cycle, where the transition to Asset Management (AM) and Facility
   Management (FM) is particularly lacking. Enterprise BIM (EBIM) is an
   emerging, unexplored, holistic organizational concept that is designed
   to support and optimize business management throughout the entire
   life-cycles of buildings and infrastructure. However, current
   understanding and implementation of EBIM is rare. To fix this gap in
   knowledge, this paper defines the EBIM concept and assesses associated
   perspectives from research and practice in order to integrate BIM more
   strongly into the enterprise's core processes and other needs at
   different levels within the organization and externally. To achieve a
   higher and more efficient utilization of building data, however, EBIMs
   need to develop a clear life-cycle-based information management
   strategy, including coordination and communication between all
   stakeholders. The paper highlights and discusses the importance of both
   available and missing standards related to the effective implementation
   of EBIM. Several existing open standards have been identified to help
   strengthen the EBIM concept. The paper identifies a need to develop
   standards to integrate BIM and IoT (the Internet of Things) and
   standards that can handle both structured and unstructured data. The
   authors have conducted a wide-ranging review of research, practice and
   existing standards and considers today's potential for using EBIM, as
   well as discusses existing challenges and future research needs.
   Furthermore, the EBIM concept is contextualized by providing a case
   study with focus on cleaning. This study identifies a need to develop
   best practices in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. Such
   practical implementation requires integrated and standardized
   information and technology management and the exploitation of the
   available technologies in interdisciplinary interaction with those
   involved in the various processes and the flow of information throughout
   the life-cycle.},

Abstract = {The worldwide awareness of the impact of buildings and infrastructure on
   the environment has increased the need for construction industry's
   professionals to embrace sustainable practices. As a result, Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) as a comprehensive environmental assessment approach
   has been widely adopted to evaluate the environmental impacts of many
   building materials. However, in many countries, a local life cycle
   inventory (LCI) is not available to calculate LCA of construction
   materials, and utilizations of overseas LCI have become an effective way
   to create a localized inventory. This study aims to develop a framework
   which makes use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) models and
   non-local LCI database to compute carbon emissions generated from the
   production and transportation of local construction materials. Inputs,
   outputs and data conversion methods are analyzed in a detailed manner.
   The study contributes to a systematic data conversion method that can
   localize existing LCIs with high accuracy and efficiency.},

   Elements},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In a context of intense environmental pressure where the construction
   sector has the greatest impact on several indicators, the reuse of
   load-bearing elements is the most promising by avoiding the production
   of waste, preserving natural resources and reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions by decreasing embodied energy. This study proposes a
   methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to
   anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of
   reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the
   building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the
   development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the
   environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse
   design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ``design from a
   stock{''} scenario, which leads to 100\% of elements being reused, using
   only elements from stock. B. ``design with a stock{''} scenario, which
   seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as
   possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to
   rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain
   allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural
   calculation model.},

Abstract = {City informationization is the future trend of urban planning and city
   management, in which the concept of digital cities in recent years been
   repeatedly mentioned. 3D models and geographic information system (GIS)
   are the most important parts to describe a digital city in multi-rate,
   multi-scale and space-time dimensions, namely the use of information
   technology to simulate city's past, present and future on digital and
   virtual implementation. However, 3D models without the buildings'
   internal information cannot provide sufficient information support to a
   digital city. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has complete
   information of a building's whole life cycle. Therefore, integration of
   BIM and GIS is the future trend of urban management.
   This paper reviews the features of BIM and GIS, discusses their
   advantages and weaknesses in this context, and then proposes the concept
   of integration of BIM models and GIS. However, there will be many
   problems to face in order to combine BIM and GIS. An Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) standard has been proposed to solve these problems. This
   paper also reviews the IFC standard and its application in conversion of
   BIM models. By comparison of three different IFC formats which were
   converted from a BIM model established by Autodesk Revit Architecture,
   some significant losses of details have been found in the converting
   process. Meanwhile, how to integrate BIM models and GIS has been
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose The New Zealand construction sector is similar to many other
   countries with a few large companies and many small and micro
   enterprises. It seeks to achieve a 20 per cent increase in productivity
   by 2020 which requires a step change in how the sector operates and
   buy-in from key stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
   set of levers to improve productivity in the construction sector and
   develop an implementation schedule. Design/methodology/approach This
   paper adopts a systems approach taking account of the nature of the
   building sector and the whole life cycle of a building from design to
   end-of-life. Information gained from the post-construction phases
   informs the pre-construction and construction phases. Findings
   Productivity is an integrated model whereby increases in process
   efficiency are executed with quality materials and workmanship, in a
   manner that is affordable for both the client and contractor and
   sustainable over time. A series of interviews and workshops produced 10
   nodal points and 19 crucial levers which were prioritised for
   implementation. Additionally, indicators were developed to monitor
   progress over time and provide information for further corrective action
   to the system. Originality/value Previous studies identified factors
   affecting productivity. Piecemeal approaches to improve productivity
   have resulted in systemic failure. A whole of life approach provides
   valuable insights to improve productivity in the construction and
   pre-construction phases which have a flow-on effect through the life
   cycle. Importantly, this research proposes drivers, an implementation
   scheme and indicators that provide leverage on nodal points to improve
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Adopting Building Information Modelling (BIM) in Building Performance
   Analysis (BPA) is becoming an emerging research area in the application
   of information technology in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry. To investigate the current state of
   research in the adoption of BIM in BPA, this study performed a holistic
   review consisting of a bibliometric analysis of existing literature,
   content analysis of selected studies, as well as follow-up qualitative
   discussion in BIM integration with BPA. The bibliometric analysis
   identified 60 relevant studies; the content analysis of these studies
   revealed the research focuses of BIM-enabled BPA, including
   interoperability, semantics, and sustainability rating systems; the
   qualitative discussion further highlighted the learning process
   throughout project delivery stages and addressed the potential gap
   between `as-designed' building performance and `as-built' performance.
   Overall, this study contributes to existing research by identifying key
   input attributes and workflow in BPA, reviewing the state-of-the-art
   research on BIM integration with BPA, and investigating the major
   research areas, namely, interoperability issues in BIM-enabled EPA
   within the context of life-cycle BPA.},

Title = {Life Cycle Carbon Footprint Assessments, Case Study of Malaysian Housing
   Sector},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing concentration of Carbon footprint into the
   environment has drastically changed the climatic conditions. Among many
   anthropogenic activities, the housing sector remains one of the major
   contributors. However, a complete assessment of these environmental
   impacts throughout the life cycle still remains an area of concern. Most
   of the study does not assess the impacts by each phase of lifecycle. The
   current work presents a complete approach for carbon footprint
   assessment including planning, construction, operational, maintenance
   and dismantling \& dispose-off phase. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with
   boundary limitations of `cradle to grave' was adopted. Thirteen housing
   units were selected as case study. These included detached,
   semi-detached and terraced types of construction. Selected units were
   developed in a virtual environment using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM). The study observed the average contribution range from 1.48
   tons-CO2/yr to 2.85 tons-CO2/yr. On individual basis, the execution
   phase dominated the five phases with almost 43 \%. The operational phase
   shared 39 \% followed by maintenance (15 \%), dismantling \& dispose-off
   (1.8 \%) and planning at the last (1.5 \%). The categorization of
   environmental impact into embodied and operational carbon footprint
   observed the embodied part in dominance. A strong positive relationship
   between the area of housing units and resulting carbon impact was also
   observed. The work presents one of few environmental studies for a
   tropical housing sector assessing complete life cycle. The study
   provides a vital guideline to the designers for ensuring a sustainable
   environment by assessing and opting less carbon intensive options at
   early stage of planning and design.},

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {BIM-LCA integration facilitates sustainability indicators in
   infrastructure projects; however, BIM-LCA integration poses
   interoperability and information exchange issues. This study develops a
   parametric-life-cycle-carbonassessment (PLCCA) model for automating
   data-integration, dynamic-computations, and online-visualization of
   carbon emissions. Emission factors (EFs) are systematically integrated
   as additional design parameters in the BIM-model. Carbon emissions are
   dynamically calculated using parameterized inputs. Rhino-Grasshopper
   plugins generate real-time bar charts and color codes inside
   BIM-environments. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) incorporates carbon
   emissions, materials, energy, and cost to optimize design parameters and
   facilitate early decisions. The performance and applicability of PLCCA
   are evaluated using a tunnel in Yunnan, China. Production and
   operational stages account for 30\% and 65\% of carbon emissions. Tunnel
   is then remodeled with optimized parameters; carbon emissions are
   recalculated to reduce environmental effects. Carbon emissions in the
   production and operational phases are reduced by 32.94\% and 28.40\%.
   This research educates project stakeholders on low-carbon techniques to
   attain carbon neutrality.},

Abstract = {Purpose Building information modeling (BIM) has been proven to enable
   outstanding results in construction processes by enhancing knowledge
   sharing with regard to a building or facility throughout its life cycle
   from the conceptual design to facility management. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the extent to which the use of BIM has impacted
   the legal and contractual implications of the existing construction
   contracts for aligning the three sets of relevant development domains:
   BIM functionality, contract procurement methods, and BIM legal and
   contractual issues to enhance the efficient use of valuable resources.
   Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study was undertaken by
   analyzing the literature using a novel approach involving a matrix that
   juxtaposes BIM functionalities for each project life cycle with contract
   procurement methods. As part of the study, 28 interactions of BIM legal
   and contractual issues have been identified, as representing positive
   and negative interactions.
   Findings The interaction matrix framework that juxtaposes BIM
   functionalities and procurement methods highlights the theoretical and
   practical relationships identified between the methods. It also
   simultaneously recognizes the constructive and destructive interactions
   between these development domains by means of critically identifying the
   possible interactions of the legal and contractual aspects of both the
   BIM project procurement and the practical aspects of BIM project
   delivery.
   Originality/value The present study contributes to the existing
   literature by extensively identifying the probable interactions of
   contractual issues within BIM functionality with contract procurement
   methods throughout the life cycle of a building construction project.},

Title = {Future proofing PPPs: Life-cycle performance measurement and Building
   Information Modelling},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are widely used to procure public
   infrastructure assets and are an effective mechanism for ensuring value
   for money. However, many PPPs in Australia have been plagued with
   controversy as they have experienced significant cost and schedule
   overruns during construction. Critical to the successful delivery of PPP
   projects is effective performance measurement/evaluation. Yet,
   conventional ex-post evaluation that solely focuses on meeting budget
   and a predetermined schedule are invariably applied to measure PPPs in
   practice. This paper reviews the performance measurement literature used
   to evaluate PPP projects and proposes that a life-cycle approach to
   their evaluation is needed to `future proof' their performance and
   ensure value for money that is delivered to the public sector. As the
   primary focus of PPPs is to maximise profitability, there is a need to
   ameliorate the coordination and integration between the Special Purpose
   Vehicle, end-users and the public sector. This can be enabled through
   the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as it not only
   provides digital representation of the physical and functional
   characteristics of an asset, but also provides key decision makers with
   the ability to make informed decisions across a project's life-cycle.
   When aligned with a series of core indicators that are used for
   performance measurement, it is suggested that BIM can act as a catalyst
   for `future proofing' PPPs and enable the successful management of an
   asset throughout its life-cycle. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become an important part of building
   design optimization. Design studios need tools that make the LCA of
   buildings faster and simple, and provide results that allow comparison
   between variants. The objective of this study was to show the
   possibility of LCA data integration into the existing building design
   tool, the DEK Building Library, which is already widely used in the
   Czech Republic, by connecting it to 1200 items of the largest Czech
   cost-estimating database, and the application of this connection into
   building information modeling (BIM) tools. This process also included
   the large-scale adaptation of 160 relevant LCA data. The main result was
   obtained using EnviBIM, a freely accessible BIM plugin, as well as a web
   interface that allows users to receive cradle-to-gate environmental
   impacts of DEK Building Library elements. Additionally, a semi-automated
   algorithms system for different groups of building materials and
   elements named EnviDataGenerator was developed in MS Excel, which
   enables the consistent linking of LCA data to the cost-estimating
   database items. This allows EnviBIM extensions and upgrades. The EnviBIM
   module was validated using case studies of three buildings modeled in
   ArchiCAD and REVIT. The difference in results compared to the manual
   calculation was 3.1\% to 10.9\%, which was considered a success.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to identify and investigate the factors affecting the
   goals of mass-housing building projects due to the use of building
   information modeling (BIM). A descriptive-survey method was used to
   collect necessary data. Fifty respondents from the target sectors and
   experts in the field of modeling building information participated in
   self-selection survey. The tools of collecting data included three
   questionnaires regarding three phases of construction work:
   pre-construction, during construction and post-construction, which were
   developed based on the three indices of cost, time and quality. The
   face, content and construct validity of the questionnaires were
   confirmed after several rounds of testing. The reliability coefficient
   of the pre-construction, during the construction and post-construction
   questionnaires were 0.923, 0.917 and 0.876, respectively. The results
   show that the F-statistic is significant for the difference between the
   three groups (pre-construction, during construction and
   post-construction) at the 0.01 level. The results confirmed that BIM has
   a great influence on a project in terms of meeting time, cost and
   quality objectives through the whole life cycle of a construction
   project: during pre-construction, construction, and post-construction
   stages.},

Abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology can be used to quantify, in
   the design phase, the impacts of a product throughout its life cycle and
   to determine which building components have the highest potential
   impacts. However, such a method has often been avoided due to the need
   for detailed input data and the complexity of the available tools. For
   that reason, although LCA is increasingly present in the construction
   sector demands, professionals continuously pursue new ways to
   incorporate such methodology to the building design and construction
   processes, as simple and uncomplicated as possible. A promising
   possibility is the incorporation of building systems LCA data in the BIM
   software tools. Numerous limitations of BIM-based LCA have been
   identified over the years. For instance, the complexity of LCA software
   tools, particularly as regards the data input and interpretation of
   results, and the interoperability issues, all need to be overcome. Once
   BIM models are composed of smart objects, which represent construction
   elements with encapsulated intelligence, they are expected to be where
   LCA data could be applied. In this paper a conceptual and methodological
   discussion will be developed on the practical possibilities of inclusion
   and export of LCA data embedded in BIM elements, focusing on Autodesk
   Revit software and its features. Such a discussion will take place by
   exploiting technological possibilities of such software and evaluating
   the possibilities of development and modification of parametric elements
   and families, as well as the further export potential of such embedded
   LCA information. The main goal is the construction of a robust
   theoretical framework that will precede the future development of a
   methodological BIM-LCA integration tool by the exploitation of the
   features available in the existing software.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of information technology has brought several
   innovations to the field of civil engineering. BIM (Building Information
   Modeling) technology places emphasis on information integration and the
   establishment of a database. It also aims to realize the building
   life-cycle management. BIM technology is exerting a significant and
   profound impact on the design, construction, management, operation, and
   maintenance of building projects. In this study, the value of BIM in
   construction projects was analyzed, and the significant meaning of this
   study was elaborated. BIM standards and the data standard of IFC were
   discussed, and the important concepts of 4D-BIM and 5D-BIM were also
   presented. The key technologies like parameterization, visualization,
   geographic information system, building life cycle management, and
   clouding computing were analyzed. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviour
   of the building was analyzed, and the value of BIM in construction was
   expounded. Particularly, the application of BIM in bidding, BIM virtual
   construction, clash detection, and refined calculation about resources
   as well as materials were analyzed in this paper. Also, the construction
   dynamical management system of 4D-BIM was discussed. Finally, the
   coordination, which acts as an important issue between the BIM design
   and BIM construction, were analyzed comprehensively.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for almost forty percent of global energy. Due
   to their high consumption of energy, buildings are on the front line of
   sustainability researches. In Turkey, six million out of twenty-two
   million buildings need to be demolished and rebuilt to meet seismic
   standards. These buildings are also far below the standards in terms of
   energy efficiency. Therefore, urban transformation can be thought of as
   a great opportunity for energy efficiency. This study investigates four
   things: (i) the energy-efficient urban transformation strategy in
   Gaziosmanpasa-Istanbul region, which is selected as a case study; (ii)
   the effect of energy efficiency in this market; (iii) the adequacy of
   energy standards of Turkey; and (iv) contribution of digitalization in
   construction to sustainability with Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   and energy analysis. According to the energy efficiency scenarios,
   energy analyses were carried out on the BIM model. The most
   cost-effective strategy was determined with the Life Cycle Cost method.
   When compared with the current situation, it is possible to save energy
   up to 227 GWh a year, which is equal to the annual heating energy demand
   of approximately 30,000 housing, in the case study area with the most
   efficient scenario to be realized.},

Abstract = {Calculating emissions and related environmental impacts for buildings is
   typically a data-heavy and labour-intensive task. Widely used life cycle
   assessment (LCA) standards require meticulous modelling of multiple
   processes for each part within a product or a subassembly. This level of
   detailing demands time-consuming manual modelling and essentially
   renders full LCA of entire city blocks unrealistic. Within this context,
   this paper investigates how LCA results of modelling processes which
   involve a range of automated input data sources compare to those
   resulting from a highly detailed base case model. Findings show that
   models generated from data gathered from Google Street View and the U.S.
   Census produce the closest results to the base case model, with the
   lowest deviations occurring in embodied energy (0.06-6.0\%) and global
   warming potential (0.7-4.8\%) results. These findings imply that data
   with lower granularity can lead to precise LCA results, depending on the
   inventory and impact categories considered.},

Abstract = {The tools used for budgeting in the building design phase are still
   insufficient to address the life cycle of the building in terms of
   environmental and cost impacts. The main objective of this research is
   to define a model for extending existing cost databases to accommodate
   life cycle sustainability assessment. For this, current classification
   systems are reviewed and a case study has been analysed using the new
   approach. To this end, a new system of classification of construction
   information is proposed for the evaluation of early design costs, when
   data are scarce and the only information available refers to the gross
   interior area and the plot. The classification organizes the costs in a
   similar way to the sustainability assessment in EN-15643. A subcategory
   has been added for revenue, developer costs, and taxes at all stages of
   the lifecycle. The resulting classification is applied to the functional
   elements of a secondary school project. In the case study, construction
   costs represent 21\% while the use stage accounts for 72\% in a 100-year
   lifespan. The results show that, starting from generic cost bases, more
   complex costs and functional costs can be defined at different stages of
   the life cycle and adjusted to sustainability assessment standards.},

Abstract = {The building sector releases 36\% of global CO2 emissions, with 66\% of
   emissions occurring during the operation stage of the life cycle of a
   building. While current research focuses on using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) for energy management of a building, there is little
   research on the visualizing building carbon emission data in BIM to
   support decision makings during operation phase. This paper proposes an
   approach for gathering, analyzing and visualizing building carbon
   emissions data by integrating BIM and carbon estimation models, to
   assist the building operation management teams in discovering carbon
   emissions problems and reducing total carbon emission. Data
   requirements, carbon emission estimation algorithms, integration
   mechanism with BIM are investigated in this paper. A case is used to
   demonstrate the proposed approach. The approach described in this paper
   provides the inhabitants important graphical representation of data to
   determine a buildings sustainability performance, and can allow policy
   makers and building managers to make informed decisions and respond
   quickly to emergency situations. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The different phases of the building life cycle include planning,
   designing, construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning.
   In each phase, lot of information is exchanged among various project
   participants. This information can be categorized into graphical and
   non-graphical data. The graphical data includes two dimensional and
   three dimensional (313) drawings and non-graphical data includes other
   project documents. Traditionally, these two information categories exist
   as independent entities and are not linked to each other. This
   non-linkage decreases the project participants' productivity due to
   implementation of time consuming information retrieval methods, and
   regeneration of data. Implementation of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) increases the project participants' productivity by facilitating
   easy information access, and reusage of data. BIM is a process of
   representing a facility through a 3D digital model and linking the
   information associated to it. Some of the benefits offered by BIM
   implementation include four dimensional modeling, five dimensional
   modeling, hazard analysis, and risk analysis. However, the existing
   industry practices facilitate the implementation of BIM only up to the
   early stage of the construction phase. This is partially due to
   unavailability of 3D as-built model and lack of integration of the
   construction process documents to the model. This paper discusses a
   process for extending the BIM beyond the preconstruction stage and
   facilitating its implementation during the maintenance and
   decommissioning phase of the life cycle. The paper also presents a case
   study conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the process by using
   commercially available BIM software products.},

Title = {Demolishing or Renovating? Life Cycle Analysis in the Design Process for
   Building Renovation: The ProGETonE Case},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {It is well known that a large part of the existing European building
   stock needs to be renovated to increase structural and energy
   performance. Unfortunately, deep renovations come with high initial
   costs, and therefore, owners and real estate developers often prefer
   complete demolition and reconstruction. Both options depend on specific
   factors, and to select which option could be the closest to the optimal
   scenario, it is necessary to evaluate all environmental, social, and
   economic indicators. Life Cycle Analysis is of great significance to
   evaluate building sustainability, in particular through the comparison
   between different design alternatives. However, the life cycle impacts
   of the construction stage depend on selected materials and technologies
   that can be subject to change during the subsequent stages of the design
   process, i.e., moving from preliminary design to detailed design and
   execution plans. With the aim of understanding the role of LCA during
   the design process, the case study of ``ProGETonE-Proactive Synergy of
   Integrated Efficient Technologies on Buildings' Envelopes{''} has been
   addressed, leading to the observation that the impacts, in particular
   the global warming potential (GWP), raised significantly. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) helped the information sharing and
   management of this project, which consists of the deep renovation and
   architectural reshaping of an existing student residence through the
   construction of integrated facade systems.},

Abstract = {Scientific contributions to BIM-sustainability integration have gained
   momentum in recent years due to the influential role of BIM as a well
   -accepted approach for sustainable construction practices. In this
   regard, some systematic reviews and informatic analysis papers have
   addressed this topic. Although these papers have provided useful
   insights, we go deeper into the body of knowledge through a critical
   lens. In addition, in this paper, keyword combination is broadened as
   opposed to other reviews, and critical insight is applied to synergies
   between BIM and sustainability through gap -spotting. For this purpose,
   98 journal articles are selected and grouped into four major categories,
   namely: (i) BIM -based Life -Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA);
   (ii) BIM for green buildings; (iii) BIM -aided construction waste
   management; (iv) state-of-the-art topics. The work `s novelty lies in
   giving a holistic understanding of previously dismissed issues and a
   critical area review. Finally, the research gaps and future
   opportunities are discussed and tabulated.},

Title = {A BIM-based LCA tool for sustainable building design during the early
   design stage},

Abstract = {Purpose A robust method in environmental load assessment of buildings is
   urgently required to reduce the environmental burden of the construction
   industry. While the industry utilizes the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   method to assess environmental impacts of detailed designs, the
   implementation of changes at that late stage of development is often
   expensive and undesirable. On the other hand, during the early design
   stages, the LCA method is severely limited by the lack of information
   available, e.g., uncertainty about final materials to be used. This
   research study investigates how building information modeling (BIM) can
   facilitate LCA analysis at an early design stage.
   Design/methodology/approach A literature review is conducted to
   establish a framework for BIM and LCA integration, which creates the
   foundation for the development of a new BIM-based LCA tool. The tool is
   empirically evaluated on a large case study of a residential building in
   Denmark. Findings Case study results show that the new tool facilitates
   decision-making in an integrated design process, providing reliable LCA
   results on an early stage model, while avoiding intermediate manual
   input by the end user in contrast to other commercial LCA tools.
   Originality/value A first prototype of a BIM-based tool is demonstrated,
   which allows professionals, small architectural companies, students and
   researchers to calculate the environmental loads of the building in the
   early design stage in an automated, transparent and time-saving manner.},

Title = {Framework for Designing Sustainable Structures through Steel Beam Reuse},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction sector requires
   carbon-intensive materials, such as steel, in the construction process
   and generates a large amount of waste in the life cycle. This causes
   global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of
   construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention,
   to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of
   the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are
   not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information
   system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this
   study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable
   steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a
   design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable
   materials based on the building information modeling. The design support
   tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides
   information about the environmental and economic impact of the project.
   In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced
   by up to 77\% through material reuse, which was consistent with the
   results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing
   reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to
   about 40\%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle
   when using reusable materials needs to be done.},

Abstract = {To increase the sustainability of buildings already in early design
   phases, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) should be integrated into Building
   Information Modelling (BIM). However, LCA and thus the calculation of
   embedded energy and greenhouse gases in early design phases can only be
   performed with a certain level of inaccuracy/uncertainty. This is caused
   by a lack of information in 3D building models in BIM. To close this
   gap, the needed information is estimated, which can only happen within a
   certain range of fuzziness. In this study, the impact of adding
   estimated information, including fuzziness, to the calculation of the
   embedded greenhouse gases (EGHG) is analysed for a specific case study.
   The main result of the study is that in early design phases important
   information for the EGHG calculation is missing which can have a high
   impact on the results and can therefore affect the design of buildings
   in early design phases.},

Abstract = {Implementing China's emission reduction regulations requires a design
   approach that integrates specific architectural and functional
   properties of railway stations with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.
   This article analyzes life cycle GHG emissions related to materials
   production, replacement and operational energy use to identify design
   drivers and reduction strategies implemented in high-speed railway
   station (HSRS) buildings. A typical middle-sized HSRS building in a cold
   climate zone in China is studied. A detailed methodology was proposed
   for the development and assessment of emission reduction strategies
   through life cycle assessment (LCA), combined with a building
   information model (BIM). The results reveal that operational emissions
   contribute the most to total GHG emissions, constituting approximately
   81\% while embodied material emissions constitute 19\%, with 94
   kgCO(2eq)/m(2).a and 22 kgCO(2eq)/m(2).a respectively. Optimizing space
   can reduce operational GHG emissions and service life extension of
   insulation materials contributes to a 15\% reduction in embodied GHG
   emissions. In all three scenarios, the reduction potentials of space,
   envelope, and material type optimization were 28.2\%, 13.1\%, and 3.5\%
   and that measures for reduced life cycle emissions should focus on space
   in the early stage of building design. This study addresses the research
   gap by investigating the life cycle GHG emissions from HSRS buildings
   and reduction strategies to help influence the design decisions of
   similar projects and large space public buildings which are critical for
   emission reduction on a larger scale.},

Title = {An Integrated Building Information Modeling and Life-Cycle Assessment
   Approach to Facilitate Design Decisions on Sustainable Building Projects
   in Canada},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {In the context of the digital and sustainable transformation of building
   projects, the integrated approach of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely studied. Recent
   advancements in such integrated modeling processes and techniques have
   not yet provided reliable and robust decision-making capabilities for
   designers to intuitively choose between material alternatives. This
   study develops a new design framework that integrates BIM, LCA, and
   multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) algorithms to facilitate
   sustainable design processes in building projects. A case study using a
   single-family housing project in the British Columbia province of Canada
   was implemented to test the designs to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed integrated framework, including a three-way comparison of
   design scenarios-conventional hot-roll steel, recycled steel, and
   timber. The results indicate a significant performance improvement with
   the adoption of recycled structural steel materials, surpassing
   conventional steel designs and demonstrating a similar performance to
   that of timber designs. The study underscores the importance of informed
   decision-making in material selection, driven by the quantitative
   analysis of digital designs and multi-criteria evaluation (e.g., social
   carbon cost). This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for
   designers, engineers, and builders to achieve sustainability when
   designing building projects through the systematic and rapid comparison
   of environmental performance.},

Title = {A framework using BIM and digital twins in facilitating LCSA for
   buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The building and construction industry generates 40\% of annual global
   CO2 emissions, aside from other environmental and social impacts, while
   it contributes to economic and societal development as a whole. Life
   Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is a proven methodology to assess
   the environmental, social and economic impacts of a product system over
   its lifecycle. Applying LCSA to the construction domain is not trivial,
   as it needs to gather and connect data across several fields. A clear
   research gap was identified in the lack of data integration and
   completeness to carry out LCSA. This paper addresses this gap and shows
   how the complementary use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   Digital Twin (DT) sourced data can facilitate and improve the LCSA of
   buildings. It includes a review of the current state of the art;
   proposes a novel methodological framework based on existing standards,
   and emphasises the roles of BIM and DT for conducting LCSA in the
   building context; this is tested in a case study of a real office
   building. The outcomes of the study demonstrate that the inclusion of
   usually neglected social impacts can be considered under LCSA, and that
   BIM and DT data provides better impact estimates, which are necessary to
   evaluate the performance gap between design estimated impacts and
   measured ones. The challenges of implementing such a framework, as well
   as the limitations of existing technologies are also highlighted and
   discussed.},

Title = {Sustainable material choice for construction projects: A Life Cycle
   Sustainability Assessment framework based on BIM and Fuzzy-AHP},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Construction professionals and researchers are increasingly looking for
   sustainable solutions for buildings in a bid to reduce some of the
   negative impacts associated with the sector. A common misconception is
   to consider sustainability as only concerning environmental issues,
   without regard for the interaction between a triple bottom line
   framework that is comprised of social, economic, and environmental
   factors. Material choice is known to impact building sustainability
   directly since the use of certain materials can dramatically alter the
   footprint generated over the life cycle of the building. However, the
   construction industry is not yet equipped with approaches that
   simultaneously account for all three aspects of sustainability when it
   comes to deciding on materials to adopt. This paper proposes a
   decision-making framework for construction professionals and researchers
   involving the integration of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment
   (LCSA), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to choose suitable materials for buildings.
   The framework is built based on a literature review of relevant papers
   to identify critical factors and challenges to implementing this
   integration. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was chosen as the MCDA
   method within the proposed framework, given that the problem of material
   choice often contains subjectivity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which is
   best solved with fuzzy logic. A residential building was adopted as a
   case study to validate the proposed framework, and the LCSA method is
   applied, covering the construction, operation, and end-of-life phases of
   the building.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {165},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Technical systems in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and
   Operations (AECO) industry are complex interconnected structures. To
   cope with this high complexity, large amounts of data must be processed
   and exchanged throughout the whole life cycle of these systems. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) offer the
   possibility to structure and link this data as well as to define common
   terminology. Semantic Web ontologies describing HVAC systems in the AECO
   industry have been developed, but an ontology for an integrated
   representation based on general system theory is missing. Therefore,
   this study proposes the TUBES System Ontology (TSO) as a knowledge
   representation for an integrated, explicit representation of linked
   technical systems, their hierarchical subdivision, structural and
   functional interconnections, and relationships to spatial entities. The
   contribution is validated on two example models, and the results are
   critically discussed, pointing out corresponding limitations as well as
   the need for further research.},

Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry
   representing a significant share of global energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions, developing sustainable design and reducing
   buildings' environmental impacts has become a priority over the past
   decades. Adopting building information modeling tools and implementing
   them into life cycle analysis techniques at the early stages of design
   has been an effective method for buildings sustainability evaluation.
   With our environment constantly changing, it is reasonable that the
   construction industry should also aim to adapt to these changes and use
   them. However, the role of local climate features and their effects on a
   building's energy output is often neglected. By using building
   information modeling-life cycle analysis integration techniques, this
   research aims to consider the role of climatic attributes along with
   some passive design strategies in the life cycle assessment of the
   building and see how it affects that building's energy performance. By
   only applying passive design strategies (not including heating,
   ventilation, and air conditioning system type), the models' energy
   demand was reduced up to 30\% of the original value. It is also
   witnessed that by using the proper equipment and construction materials
   that match the respective climate, up to 28\% of the building's energy
   consumption during the operational phase, can be saved. Although
   insulation of the walls does reduce energy consumption values, it also
   contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in greenhouse
   gas emissions was estimated to be around 3\%, but since the insulation
   boards make up only 2\% of the building's area, it is a considerable
   amount.},

   demolition waste and evaluating its environmental impacts},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {159-169},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The amount of building demolition waste produced in China is large, and
   waste treatment processes discharge many pollutants. Pre-evaluating
   waste's environmental damage at the design stage of building projects
   could provide an opportunity to understand and minimize potential
   environmental impacts. Tools that can conveniently estimate the amount
   of demolition waste and quantify its impacts are lacking. This study
   combines building information modeling (BIM), geographic information
   system (GIS), and life cycle assessment (LCA) to develop an estimation
   and evaluation system for building demolition waste. In this system, BIM
   digitizes the specific characteristics of the evaluated buildings and
   provides geometric and semantic information for waste estimation. GIS
   offers geographic information regarding waste treatment plants and
   landfill site, and is used to design waste transportation routes. LCA
   provides an environmental impact assessment framework and quantifies
   ecological damage impacts and resource depletion impacts due to
   demolition waste. The system includes five modules, which form the basis
   of an automated calculation tool. The evaluation tool can quickly
   quantify the amount of waste and assess its impacts, while achieving
   automated waste estimation and impact evaluation after a building is
   designed. A building in a middle school is taken as a case study to
   demonstrate and verify the system. This study provides an operable tool
   for waste evaluation and management at the design stage. With the
   increasing application of BIM technology in the construction industry,
   this tool is expected to gain popularity and promote efficient waste
   management.},

Title = {A Building Information Modeling-Based Life Cycle Assessment of the
   Embodied Carbon and Environmental Impacts of High-Rise Building
   Structures: A Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {High-rise buildings represent technological, urban, and life-style
   trends of the modern urban landscape, yet there are limited data
   regarding their embodied carbon and environmental impacts, particularly
   when compared to low- or mid-rise buildings. Given that the projected
   growth of the global urban population by 2050 requires cities with
   higher density and potentially a greater number of high-rise buildings,
   it is crucial to develop a clear understanding of the embodied carbon
   and environmental impacts of high-rise buildings. The primary structural
   materials used in high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and
   structural steel. As of today, over 99\% of tall buildings' structures
   are built from those two materials. This article utilizes a building
   information modeling (BIM)-based life cycle assessment (LCA) in Revit
   and Tally to examine the embodied carbon and environmental impacts of an
   actual high-rise building structure case study in Chicago that uses a
   hybrid concrete steel structure. The results show that the embodied
   carbon and environmental impacts of the high-rise building structure are
   dominated by the impacts of the product stage in the building's life
   cycle and by concrete being the main structural material. Specifically,
   this study reveals that concrete constitutes a substantial 91\% share of
   the total mass of the building structure, with a 74\% contribution to
   the life cycle global warming potential, 53\% to the acidification
   potential, 74\% to the eutrophication potential, 74\% to the smog
   formation potential, and 68\% to the non-renewable energy usage. On the
   other hand, steel accounts for 9\% of the building's structure mass,
   estimated to constitute 26\% of the global warming potential, 47\% of
   the acidification potential, 26\% of the eutrophication potential, 26\%
   of the smog formation potential, and 32\% of the non-renewable energy
   usage.},

Abstract = {This research aims to provide a design option with the lowest energy
   consumption in the two mentioned phases as the optimal solution. To this
   end, this study employs a combination of life cycle assessment (LCA),
   multi-objective optimization algorithm, and building information
   modeling (BIM) to improve sustainability in operation and demolition
   phases for the facade of an open office building. First, the destructive
   environmental effects caused by the demolition of 100 m(2) of each
   material were calculated by the LCA. Then after parametric modeling,
   geometric parameters and material data were selected from the previous
   step, simulation and optimization of objectives were performed, and the
   optimal solution was presented, which should be added to the BIM model
   by designing a plugin for data integration. Compared to the initial
   design options, selecting the appropriate parameters and materials and
   thus producing the optimal solution led to a 53.48 and 66.23\% reduction
   in operational and demolition energy consumption, respectively. Applying
   this approach encourages architects to use innovative methods to take
   practical steps to improve the sustainability of their projects by
   choosing suitable design options.},

Abstract = {According to the National Institute of Building Science (2006),. one of
   the main goals of building commissioning is to ``maintain facility
   performance across its life cycle{''}. In recent years, the maturing of
   sensing technology has helped to advance this vision through
   sensor-assisted building commissioning. For residential projects,
   however, the overhead associated with long-term sensor performance and
   quality assurance and sensor data analysis creates a barrier that
   diminishes the benefit of such technological advancement.
   This paper describes how the principles of complex system theory can be
   applied to address these issues in the context of residential building.
   Two cases are presented. First case demonstrates the application of
   ``scale{''} and ``format{''}' that underline the idea of ``bounded
   rationality{''} in dealing with imperfect sensor data. Second case
   refers to the idea of ``decomposable hierarchical system'{''} as the
   framework for building system information modeling to reduce the level
   of difficulty for resident's participation in life cycle commissioning.},

Abstract = {The use of building information modelling (BIM), as a process throughout
   the life cycle of a building, can be found in all types of buildings.
   Specific phases of buildings' life are brownfields, buildings that are
   dilapidated, abandoned and no longer serving their purpose. These
   buildings are not included in the classical life cycle of buildings
   because such options are not considered in advance. Many buildings,
   however, become brownfields for various reasons, and these buildings
   also need to be addressed in urban engineering. An information model is
   a realistic representation of the building in a digital form on the
   basis of graphical and descriptive information data, which unifies into
   a common digital database and works with all relevant information. The
   principles of BIM can be used to solve the problem of brownfields in
   urban areas and to apply the results obtained in the process of decision
   making and realisation of regeneration. Particular simulations over a
   digital model include, for example, how impacted are structures exposed
   to strong wind conditions or the impact of the surrounding area on the
   wind flow through the site and the spreading of pollution or
   contamination to the surrounding area.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The building industry has a high energy consumption, which results in
   natural resource depletion, land use, ecosystem degradation, atmospheric
   pollution, and many other environmental impacts. Therefore, in modern
   construction, while maintaining a satisfactory and comfortable interior
   environment, less energy consumption and resource use is a major
   objective of building design. This research explored life cycle energy
   (LCE), life cycle assessment (LCA), and life cycle costing (LCC) to
   evaluate the sustainability performance of building facades for their
   selection. A research framework was proposed considering environmental,
   social, and economic impacts (triple bottom line approach). The proposed
   framework was applied to a medium-rise commercial building in the city
   of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Four building facades (brick, granite,
   aluminum, and glass facades) were selected and compared by their life
   cycle impacts (i.e., impacts in the preuse, use, and posture phases). An
   energy model was developed in DesignBuilder 4.2 to estimate the impact
   of the energy demand of each facade during the operational phase. LCA of
   each facade was performed using SimaPro 8 software. Later, selected
   facades were compared using multicriteria decision analysis for three
   proposed scenarios: proenvironment, neutral, and proeconomic. Based on
   the analysis, brick facade was identified as the most sustainable facade
   in the neutral and proeconomic scenario, whereas a granite facade was
   the most sustainable alternative in the proenvironment scenario. Life
   cycle emergy analysis was conducted to validate the proenvironment
   scenario results. This study provides decision support to architects and
   engineers for the selection of sustainable building facades based on the
   triple bottom line of sustainability. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {Despite the importance of life cycle assessment (LCA) in inspecting
   environmental impacts, its execution through manual methods affects the
   quality of the results, besides consuming the time and effort of
   decision-makers in the construction industry, such as designers,
   implementers, facility managers, and consultants. When LCA relies on
   building information modeling (BIM), it encounters many difficulties and
   obstacles, such as human intervention, conflicts among platforms and
   environmental databases, and no coordination to integrate or manage
   information. Thus, the research aims to support LCA through automatized
   integration with BIM depending on BIM's role in information management,
   promoting decisions, and activating BIM implementation success factors
   to make the BIM model qualified for the LCA. Then, the BIM and LCA
   overlap methods were analyzed and exemplified. Also, the requirements of
   their integration strategies were identified for LCA to become automated
   from now. Accordingly, the process map that supports and coordinates the
   automatized integration of LCA and BIM, overcomes integration
   difficulties, and conducts LCA through automated methods was deduced and
   structured. The analytical hierarchy process was applied through the
   survey using questionnaires and interviews to validate this map. The
   survey affirmed that the BIM model acquired new characteristics and will
   play an essential role in the LCA's accuracy, reliability, and
   comprehensiveness. This map supports the standardization and alternative
   strategies of the workflow. Furthermore, the interconnected stages of
   this map as a scenario can conduct an LCA within any project's life
   stage and guarantee its quality.},

Abstract = {The shift towards Nearly Zero Energy Building (Nearly-ZEB) construction
   represents an attempt by the construction industry to limit the global
   warming potential of the sector. An investigation was carried out on how
   the structural frame of a low energy, residential, medium rise building
   is expected to affect energy use over the life cycle of the building.
   The feasibility of incorporating sustainable design constraints at the
   preliminary design is also assessed through the use of computer
   modelling and simulation methods. The findings of this paper show that
   by implementing simulation and knowledge management software, a life
   cycle approach to building construction can be adopted from the design
   conception stage. Results show that the building structure can influence
   life cycle energy use and carbon emissions. This information will
   provide an element of design control regarding environmental performance
   to Engineers across Europe from the early stages of the project. (C)

Title = {Uncertainty Analysis of Embedded Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
   Using BIM in Early Design Stages},

Abstract = {With current efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions of buildings in the operational phase, the share of
   embedded energy (EE) and embedded GHG emissions is increasing. In early
   design stages, chances to influence these factors in a positive way are
   greatest, but very little and vague information about the future
   building is available. Therefore, this study introduces a building
   information modeling (BIM)-based method to analyze the contribution of
   the main functional parts of buildings to find embedded energy demand
   and GHG emission reduction potentials. At the same time, a sensitivity
   analysis shows the variance in results due to the uncertainties inherent
   in early design to avoid misleadingly precise results. The sensitivity
   analysis provides guidance to the design team as to where to
   strategically reduce uncertainties in order to increase precision of the
   overall results. A case study shows that the variability and sensitivity
   of the results differ between environmental indicators and construction
   types (wood or concrete). The case study contribution analysis reveals
   that the building's structure is the main contributor of roughly half of
   total GHG emissions if the main structural material is reinforced
   concrete. Exchanging reinforced concrete for a wood structure reduces
   total GHG emissions by 25\%, with GHG emissions of the structure
   contributing 33\% and windows 30\%. Variability can be reduced
   systematically by first reducing vagueness in geometrical and technical
   specifications and subsequently in the amount of interior walls. The
   study shows how a simplified and fast BIM-based calculation provides
   valuable guidance in early design stages.},

Abstract = {One of the most important target controls in engineering management is
   construction safety. Because there are annual reports of construction
   safety accidents in China, traditional safety management should look for
   breakthroughs. Although many scholars use various methods to improve
   building safety, they lack the consideration of building life cycle
   safety planning. Therefore, this paper proposes a life cycle safety
   management platform based on BIM-4D. The issues with traditional safety
   management are first examined. Then, in order to address these issues,
   this paper proposes the use of BIM-4D technology to improve project
   safety management and exhibits the benefits of this technology in this
   regard. Following that, a BIM-4D-based life cycle safety management
   platform is built, followed by a life cycle application process scheme
   for the management platform, so that all project participants may
   understand their duties in safety management. The results show that this
   paper provides a reference for the deepening application of life cycle
   safety management of construction projects.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},

Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The energy consumption of the construction industry has been increasing
   year by year, posing a huge challenge to China's dual carbon goals of
   peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. The Chinese
   construction industry has huge potential for energy conservation and
   emission reduction, and the government has therefore put forward
   requirements for constructing green buildings and formulated strict
   evaluation standards. The carbon emissions of the construction industry
   involve various stages of the entire life cycle and are closely related
   to the green building design standards that meet the requirements. This
   article sets multiple objective functions based on the two dimensions of
   the carbon emissions of the entire life cycle of buildings and green
   building evaluation and uses the NSGA-II algorithm in genetic algorithms
   to optimize ten indicators selected from the two objectives. Based on
   this, building information modeling (BIM) modeling was carried out for
   an office building project in Southwest China, and energy consumption
   analysis and evaluation were conducted based on the project's
   multidisciplinary model. The dialectical relationship between the carbon
   emissions of the entire life cycle of buildings and the green building
   evaluation values was discovered, and the optimized parameter
   combination scheme corresponding to the Pareto solution set was
   obtained, providing a reference for using improved genetic algorithms
   and BIM technology to optimize green building design.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is being increasingly accepted by
   the building industry as an innovative method for integrating many
   different data related to a building. Part of this data concerns
   performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy
   consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus
   of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building
   design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that
   reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view
   of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in
   the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different
   risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into
   a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first,
   integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into
   the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating
   uncertainty and computing risk metrics. Finally, the evaluation of risk
   levels is supported by the use of semantic web technologies through a
   risk ontology. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier},

Title = {A critical review on BIM and LCA integration using the ISO 14040
   framework},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {213},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The application of building information modelling (BIM) in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) brings significant benefits, resulting in increasing
   publications in the field of BIM-LCA integration. However, there is no
   systematic examination on the present status in BIM-LCA integration. In
   this regard, ISO 14040 standard series provides a systematic framework.
   This study investigates the latest research development in BIM-LCA
   integration using ISO 14040 framework. The analysis focused on research
   studies on data collection, data mapping and data exchange between BIM
   and LCA data and expression of buildings' environmental impacts from
   2012 to 2021. 61 articles have been collected and analysed by using
   content analysis methods. The results indicate that LCA data sources are
   well presented in BIM-LCA integration studies but the accessibility of
   data from BIM model is poor. Moreover, manual work is the most popular
   method for data exchange. Environmental impacts from buildings are
   mainly presented in traditional ways such as bar charts and pie charts.
   This study also reveals that majority of BIM-LCA integration studies
   focus on comparing design alternatives. Findings of this research study
   identified several unaddressed issues, such as lack of understanding in
   applicability of each BIM-LCA integration approach and unified structure
   between BIM and LCA data. By drawing on these findings, authors provide
   recommendations on improving BIM-LCA integration, such as recommending
   to create strategies for selecting suitable integration approaches for
   different LCA scenarios. This research provides academics and
   practitioners with a comprehensive understanding in the current
   development of BIM-LCA integration, and heuristic implications for
   future studies.},

   Industry},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO)
   industry is evolving rapidly. In particular, technological advancements
   and lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic are shaping the
   industry's future. Various artificial intelligence (AI), building
   information modeling (BIM), and Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have
   contributed to the industry's modernization by enabling more
   self-reliable, self-automated, self-learning, time-saving, and
   cost-effective processes throughout the various life cycle phases of a
   smart building or city. As a result, the concept of digital twins (DTs)
   has recently emerged as a potential solution to optimize the AECO sector
   to achieve the required cyber-physical integration, particularly
   following the pandemic. Based on a systematic review, the study develops
   and proposes theoretical models that examine the evolution of DTs in the
   context of BIM, cutting-edge technologies, platforms, and applications
   throughout the project's life cycle phases. This study demonstrates DTs'
   high potential as a comprehensive approach to planning, managing,
   predicting, and optimizing AECO projects that will achieve more
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, while DTs offer many new
   opportunities, they also pose technical, societal, and operational
   challenges that must be addressed.},

Abstract = {To foster sustainable development, the environmental impacts of the
   construction sector need to be reduced substantially. Life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is the established methodology for the quantification
   of environmental impacts, and therefore has been increasingly applied to
   assess the environmental performance of buildings. By coupling LCAs with
   digital design tools, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), the
   identification of environmental hotspots and their mitigation is
   possible during the design process. The objective of the study is to
   identify the current integration approaches, and determine the pros and
   cons of the integration process from different viewpoints, namely,
   technical, informational, organizational and functional issues.
   Therefore, a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) was
   performed. We identified 60 relevant BIM-LCA case studies and analyzed
   the applied BIM-LCA workflows in detail. A total of 16 of the reviewed
   studies applied LCA during the early design stage. These studies used a
   manual or semiautomatic data exchange between the BIM models and LCA
   tools. In most cases, contemporary BIM-LCA workflows utilized
   conventional spreadsheets (e.g., Excel sheets in 16 cases). However, the
   analysis shows that an automated link between LCA and BIM can be
   achieved when overcoming the technical, organizational and informational
   issues discussed in the paper. This could enable the streamlining of LCA
   applications in design practice, and thus support the necessary
   improvements in the environmental performance of buildings.},

Abstract = {In the present Information Technology era, software research community
   has lot of pressure to reduce development cost as well as development
   time. Therefore large number software is being developed by using third
   party component. The traditional software life cycle model provides a
   systematic method to separate the different phases with efficient
   boundaries. A number of software life cycle models existing today
   primarily focused on building of traditional software systems. The exact
   nature of the relationships between traditional software life cycle
   models and life cycle models that incorporate the different phase
   imposed by Component Based Software Engineering are needed. Hence,
   Component Based Software Engineering raises questions about whether
   existing software engineering life cycle approaches are appropriate in
   this emerging field. Therefore a life cycle model which incorporate
   testing or verification as a continuous process is being proposed. In
   this paper we examine the various software life cycle models. We argue
   that testing phase in life cycle model not only overlaps but also cut
   across the various developments phase stages. We are proposing a
   software life cycle model for component based software development from
   the conventional models known as a Umbrella life cycle model.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {156},
Pages = {876-887},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a comprehensive environmental assessment
   approach has been widely adopted to evaluate the environmental impacts
   of many building materials. However, only a few life cycle inventories
   (LCIs) have been developed in certain countries with prevailing
   boundaries and scopes which prevent them from being applied directly to
   a different location. Therefore utilizations of overseas LCI with valid
   modification have become an effective way to expand the usage of
   existing LCI as well as to quickly establish a localized inventory. This
   study aims to develop a framework which makes use of non local LCI data
   and Building Information Modelling (BIM) to evaluate the environmental
   impact of local construction materials-specifically, total carbon
   emissions from the ``cradle to site{''} process of construction
   materials. Framework inputs, outputs and data conversion methods are
   analysed in a detailed manner. A case study in Singapore which focuses
   on carbon emissions generated from cement production and transportation
   is employed to showcase the application of the proposed framework in LCA
   practice. The result obtained was compared with the actual benchmark to
   validate the framework's performance. The estimated percentage of error
   was 2\%, which is much smaller than the one from raw LCI of 14\%.
   Discussion and sensitivity analysis regarding to the robustness of the
   results in the presence of uncertainty have also been discussed. The
   result can expand the existing knowledge of cross-boundary LCI usage for
   construction materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to solve the problems in practical application of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) as an innovative tool and production method,
   the author proposes a method for simulating modern buildings using the
   Ecotect software. This method establishes a digital BIM parametric
   model, the digital information technology is directly applied to the
   whole life cycle of the construction project, and then the effectiveness
   of the method is verified by examples. The result obtained is as
   follows: The authors' method is designed with the assumption that
   Construct III is below the standard limit throughout the year, in order
   to meet the requirements of energy-saving design; it is recommended to
   change the type of external window in the engineering design scheme and
   make the energy consumption of buildings meet the requirements of
   energy-saving standards. The method proposed by the author saves about
   20\% of the construction cost compared with the traditional method. It
   is proved that the author's method can make architectural designers
   correctly understand the feasibility and applicability of the Ecotect
   software in building energy conservation and promote BIM technology and
   software; BIM technology can be widely used in engineering projects,
   allowing architects to select the right and suitable software for
   various energy conservation simulations and build energy-saving building

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {173},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that building information modeling (BIM)
   and life-cycle assessments (LCAs) could be integrated to quantify and
   alleviate the environmental effects of buildings while simplifying and
   optimizing data acquisition. However, there has been no expert-based
   research into the true potential of BIM-based LCAs in a wider context
   with consideration of the advantages and disadvantages. This study aims
   to identify, classify, and prioritize these advantages and disadvantages
   using mixed methodological research and subject matter experts (SMEs).
   This includes a comprehensive literary review, semi-structured
   interviews with SMEs, and use of the Delphi method. A total of 21
   advantages and 7 disadvantages associated with BIM-based LCAs were
   identified and classified. The advantages were grouped into four
   categories: decision making, material selection, sustainability
   performance, and waste reduction. The disadvantages were grouped into
   two categories: standardization and data processing. The Delphi method
   was applied via two rounds of questionnaires with ten SMEs to prioritize
   the advantages and disadvantages. The results of this study will provide
   practitioners and researchers with constructive information for the
   integrated use of BIM and LCAs and will create awareness in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The identified
   disadvantages show the requirements for future work and the priority
   rankings for both the advantages and disadvantages could be used by
   researchers and key stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The increased popularity of building information modeling (BIM) for
   application in the construction of eco-friendly green buildings has
   given rise to techniques for evaluating green buildings constructed
   using BIM features. Existing BIM-based green building evaluation
   techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which
   pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data
   compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To
   overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the
   green template) for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of
   using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle
   assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of
   detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental
   impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied
   environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting
   an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were
   developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation
   table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials.
   Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental
   impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its
   applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied
   environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated
   against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2D takeoff), and its
   reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of 5\%. This study
   aims to develop a system for assessing the impact of the substances
   discharged from concrete production process on six environmental impact
   categories, i.e., global warming (GWP), acidification (AP),
   eutrophication (EP), abiotic depletion (ADP), ozone depletion (ODP), and
   photochemical oxidant creation (POCP), using the life a cycle assessment
   (LCA) method. To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically
   applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by
   adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations.},

Abstract = {Purpose The built environment is taking enormous leaps towards its
   digitalization. Computer-aided tools such as building information
   modeling (BIM) are found in the forefront of this evolution, playing a
   critical role in creating the foundations for the upcoming development
   of smart low-carbon cities. However, the potential of BIM is still
   untapped - links will need to be created among the available and
   forthcoming methodologies under one integral operational system. The
   purpose of this paper is to present an integrated BIM-based life
   cycle-oriented framework for achieving sustainable constructions at the
   pre-construction phase. The developed framework represents an example of
   the approaches that the construction industry will need to adopt to
   integrate the different tools under an integrated smart city context.
   Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach follows the
   development of four same-volume different-configuration
   three-dimensional BIM designs, which are coupled with life cycle
   assessment (LCA) tools for establishing sustainable building design.
   Findings The results of this paper indicated that the choice of building
   design and shape can play a significant role in reducing the embodied
   energy and embodied carbon of buildings, achieving a reduction of up to
   15\% compared to a reference building of same volume and gross floor
   area. Originality/value The originality of this paper is found in its
   approach application by coupling three-dimensional BIM models with LCA
   data, the use of reinforcement detailing in an nD BIM study and the
   employment of country-specific LCA databases.},

Abstract = {Featured Application using Virtual Tours (VTs) to complement Building
   Information Models (BIMs) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems as a
   solution for remote control, building automation systems, and other
   tasks involved in Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM). The aim is
   to provide contextual access to information and opportunities for
   interaction, simplifying the task of those responsible for managing and
   maintaining building assets.Abstract This study investigates the
   integration of Building Information Models (BIMs) and Virtual Tour (VT)
   environments in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   industry, focusing on Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM),
   Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs), and data Life-Cycle
   Assessment (LCA). The interconnected nature of tasks throughout a
   building's life cycle increasingly demands a seamless integration of
   real-time monitoring, 3D models, and building data technologies. While
   there are numerous examples of effective links between IoT and BIMs, as
   well as IoT and VTs, a research gap exists concerning VT-BIM
   integration. This article presents a technical solution that connects
   BIMs and IoT data using VTs to enhance workflow efficiency and
   information transfer. The VT is developed upon a pilot based on the
   Controlled Environments for Living Lab Studies (CELLS), a unique
   facility designed for flexible monitoring and remote-control processes
   that incorporate BIMs and IoT technologies. The findings offer valuable
   insights into the potential of VTs to complement and connect to BIMs
   from a life-cycle perspective, improving the usability of digital twins
   for beginner users and contributing to the advancement of the AEC and
   CAFM industries. Our technical solution helps complete the connectivity
   of BIMs-VT-IoT, providing an intuitive interface (VT) for rapid data
   visualisation and access to dashboards, models and building databases.
   The practical field of application is facility management, enhancing
   monitoring and asset management tasks. This includes (a) sensor data
   monitoring, (b) remote control of connected equipment, and (c)
   centralised access to asset-space information bridging BIM and visual
   (photographic/video) data.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been evolving to embrace sustainability.
   This has highlighted the necessity to inspect sustainable performances
   throughout the post-construction building lifecycle. Application of
   relevant Building Management Systems (BMS) to achieve this goal is
   essential. Likewise, it is vital to balance the maximization of building
   energy efficiency and users' desired level of comfort while employing an
   efficient BMS for sustainable maintenance of facility operations. The
   high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections plus the lack
   of real-time input of dynamic factors urges development of automated
   BMS. Therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a key role
   towards automation in construction and corresponding management systems.
   Despite the nD capability of BIM enabling its potential practice during
   building lifecycle phases, designers-contractors focused primarily on
   the application of BIM during design construction management stages.
   Moreover, integration of knowledge management systems empower handling
   and sharing of building maintenance information during the building
   lifecycle. This is essential for post construction sustainable
   performance. Focusing on building energy efficiency, this article has
   reviewed 96 papers and suggests engagement of an Integrated
   Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications
   (BIM-IKBMS) during the post-construction building lifecycle to advance
   the successful implementation of sustainable building performances.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {BIM adoption has accelerated worldwide since it is an important enabling
   technology for digitalisation in the construction industry. Adopting BIM
   requires transforming the traditional building life cycle stages
   (planning, design, construction and facilities management) into
   BIM-integrated project deliveries. Assessing the BIM capabilities of
   these stages helps organisations to identify gaps in their BIM uses and
   improve them. There is a lack of a comprehensive model in the literature
   for assessing the BIM capabilities of individual building life cycle
   stages and their processes. Existing assessment models focus on
   assessing the BIM maturity of construction projects and organisations
   which do not inform the required BIM improvements for individual stages
   and their processes. Hence, we iteratively developed the Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) Capability Assessment REference Model
   (BIM-CAREM) and demonstrated its usability through multiple explanatory
   case studies performed with two international design and engineering
   companies and two general contractors in Turkey. We assessed the BIM
   capabilities of design, construction and facility management processes
   of various buildings i.e. residential, stadiums, hospitals and airports.
   The results showed that the BIM capability levels of design,
   construction and facility management processes vary within and across
   the companies.},

Title = {BIM-based LCA as a comprehensive method for the refurbishment of

   efficiency, and profitability: A case study in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {In the light of special attention of world governments to a viable and
   sustainable decarbonization way of the existing building stock, this
   article considered the feasibility of using a method of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for the
   refurbishment in terms of environmental compatibility, energy
   efficiency, and profitability. An existing residential building in
   Nanjing was chosen as a case study. The paper investigated the
   environmental, energy, and economic efficiency of the case building
   hypothetically refurbished to the Passive House (PH) and ``low energy
   building{''} (LEB) technologies. The analysis was made based on real
   construction and energy consumption data, monitored over three years.
   Also, a comparison of the environmental, energy-efficient, and economic
   feasibility of two hypothetical models refurbished to the PH and LEB
   technologies is considered. The results show that BIM-enabled LCA is a
   powerful tool for refurbishing existing residential buildings due to a
   comprehensive assessment of environmental compatibility, energy
   efficiency, and profitability. According to the results, special
   attention should be paid to reducing cooling loads, using materials with
   a high recycling rate and low cost, reducing the thickness of the
   insulation layer, using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) windows with movable
   sunshades, and setting horizontal and vertical greenery systems.},

Abstract = {Environmental problems, especially climate change, have become a serious
   global issue waiting for people to solve. In the construction industry,
   the concept of sustainable building is developing to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. In this study, a building information modeling (BIM)
   based building design optimization method is proposed to facilitate
   designers to optimize their designs and improve buildings'
   sustainability. A revised particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is
   applied to search for the trade-off between life cycle costs (LCC) and
   life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) of building designs. In order to
   validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study
   of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong. The result of the case
   study shows that this method can enlarge the searching space for optimal
   design solutions and shorten the processing time for optimal design
   results, which is really helpful for designers to deliver an economic
   and environmental-friendly design scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   methodology to reduce the environmental impacts in the building sector.
   Research studies usually face challenges in presenting comprehensive LCA
   results due to the complexity of assessments at the building level.
   There is a dearth of methods for the systematic evaluation and
   optimization of the WBLCA performance at the design stage. The study
   aims to develop a design optimization framework based on the proposed
   WBLCA method to evaluate and improve the environmental performance at
   the building level. Design/methodology/approach The WBLCA development
   method is proposed with detailed processes based on the EN 15978
   standard. The environmental product declaration (EPD) methods were
   adopted to ensure the WBLCA is comprehensive and reliable. Building
   information modeling (BIM) was used to ensure the building materials and
   assembly contributions are accurate and provide dynamic material updates
   for the design optimization framework. Furthermore, the interactive
   BIM-LCA calculation processes were demonstrated for measuring the
   environmental impacts of design upgrades. The TOPSIS-based LCA results
   normalization was selected to conduct the comparisons of various
   building design upgrades. Findings The case study conducted for a
   residential building showed that the material embodied impacts and the
   operational energy use impacts are the two critical factors that
   contribute 60-90\% of the total environmental impacts and resource uses.
   Concrete and wood are the main material types accounting for an average
   of 65\% of the material embodied impacts. The air and water heating for
   the house are the main energy factors, as these account for over 80\% of
   the operational energy use. Based on the original WBLCA results, two
   scenarios were established to improve building performance through the
   design optimization framework. Originality/value The LCA results show
   that the two upgraded building designs create an average of 5\%
   reduction compared with the original building design and improving the
   thermal performance of the house with more insulation materials does not
   always reduce the WBLCA results. The proposed WBLCA method can be used
   to compare the building-level environmental performances with the
   similar building types. The proposed framework can be used to support
   building designers to effectively improve the WBLCA performance.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment and Building Information Modeling Integrated
   Approach: Carbon Footprint of Masonry and Timber-Frame Constructions in
   Single-Family Houses},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The analysis of the carbon footprint of buildings is a key tool for
   assessing the impact of different buildings on climate change. Several
   frameworks and methodologies are available to calculate the footprint of
   buildings, including standards and norms, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA),
   and dedicated software tools. The use of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) programme for these calculations is both scientifically justified
   and very practical. This scientific publication focuses on the
   application of a BIM-based research methodology to analyse the carbon
   footprint of a single-family house. The research process included the
   following steps: (i) the design of a single-family house with masonry
   construction using Archicad 26, BIM programme, (ii) simulation of the
   building energy performance using the EcoDesigner Star plug-in, (iii)
   LCA using the plug-in for Archicad, (iv) preparation of a second model
   with timber-frame construction for comparison, and (v) comparative
   analysis of the single-family house models with masonry construction
   (building A) and timber-frame (building B). Analysis of the results
   highlights significant differences in CO2e emissions between buildings
   and the varying impact of individual elements on the total CO2e
   emissions of the buildings studied. Building A had significantly higher
   net emissions, amounting to 43,226.94 kg CO2e, in stark contrast to
   Building B's significantly lower 13,522.13 kg CO2e. This discrepancy was
   also mirrored in the emission intensity, with Building A emitting at a
   rate of 281.06 kg CO2e/m2 compared to Building B's 96.72 kg CO2e/m2.
   These findings are relevant for future work on sustainable building
   design and construction aiming to minimise negative environmental
   impacts. The goal of minimising the cumulative carbon footprint of
   buildings is critical to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and
   combating climate change.},

Title = {Life-cycle assessment of non-domestic building stocks: A meta-analysis
   of current modelling methods},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building stock models (BSMs) are essential for simulating the
   contributions of regional and national building sectors to climate
   change under different policy scenarios, and for identifying pathways to
   climate change mitigation. To date, BSMs have focused on the operational
   life-cycle impacts of domestic dwellings; there has been less emphasis
   either on non-domestic buildings (NDBs) or full life-cycle analysis.
   This paper provides a first review of the theory and practice of NDB
   stock modelling which considers life-cycle energy, emissions and costs.
   A meta-analysis of the literature was undertaken involving a structured
   search of relevant articles in key scientific repositories. 98 in-scope
   studies were identified and data collected on their aims and objectives,
   methodologies, data sources, system boundaries, considered impacts,
   representativeness, uncertainty analysis, validation and verification
   techniques, further research identified, model transparency and software
   tools employed. The review necessitated the classification of modelling
   methodologies. The existing `bottom-up' and `top-down' groups were found
   to be ambiguous and led to confusion. Therefore, an alternative
   methodology classification is proposed, considering both the modelling
   technique and model simulation data used. The findings of the analysis
   indicate that most approaches use engineering models employing archetype
   data. However, almost all current life-cycle models of NDB stocks are
   incomplete. Only one study considered the full building life-cycle and
   most did not include uncertainty analysis. The reproducibility of study
   results is poor since most do not provide sufficiently-detailed
   information on the models and data used. Critically, there is a lack of
   representative input data which limits their usefulness as evidence in
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is receiving ever-increasing attention and is
   utilized by many construction companies in their current practices. This
   paper aims at a critical investigation of the impact of VR technology on
   how sustainability and cost are understood and perceived by the users in
   building design projects, which could lead to improving and supporting
   the actual building design processes. The research study focused on
   evaluating design alternatives using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)-enabled VR technology integrated with cost and sustainability life
   cycle assessment (LCA) software. In doing so, the paper begins with
   reviewing the relevant literature in the mentioned areas. Thereafter, it
   adopts an experimental-qualitative-quantitative method to test the
   research hypothesis and analyze the effects of 360-degree VR on the
   users (66 participants), while distinguishing between users who have a
   relevant background in building/construction engineering (i.e.,
   architect engineers and civil engineers), and those who have not (i.e.,
   owners and clients). It is observed that despite their background, the
   user participants positively embrace the ideas and aspirations of
   sustainability, and that there is some evidence of respondents
   preferring the economy over sustainability. Likewise, the participants
   are not making an effort to measure the emissions of their design
   options rather than focus on the building's economic aspects.},

Abstract = {The revolution towards Industry 4.0 in the AECO Industry has taken
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) as one of its central points. BIM
   abilities for automatization, interoperability and sustainability play a
   key role in this change. In this paper, a literature review about BIM
   adoption for the structural project is presented. The aim of the
   presented review is to clearly establish the current state of knowledge
   of the implementation of the BIM methodology in the field of structural
   analysis. Papers related to these two topics simultaneously, BIM and
   structure analysis, during the last 10 years have been selected. The
   literature has been analysed from two different approaches. First,
   bibliometric analysis has been performed, studying the production on the
   topic. Secondly, 81 representative papers have been selected and
   analysed, establishing thematic areas via cluster analysis. The articles
   have also been classified upon several categorizations based on the
   structural life cycle and their aim. Finally, a SWOT analysis is
   performed from this data to create a complete framework that shows the
   state of the integration of the structural project in BIM environments
   and possible future developments and risks. This set of studies shows a
   tendency towards design tools and new buildings. While automatization
   and computer-aided design have been a trend in the research for several
   years, a research gap on the structural analysis via BIM for existing
   and heritage buildings has been pointed out, showing its ability to
   improve the analysis of existing buildings and its maintenance.},

Title = {Value Management Integration for Whole Life Cycle: Post COVID-19
   Strategy for the UK Construction Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Value management (VM) and its integration in the whole life cycle (WLC)
   have become huge concepts for construction projects to provide
   additional value of an asset for the end user or client. However, the
   role of VM and its integration as part of the WLC in a construction
   project remain reactive, and highly impacted by nature of the project,
   and this has become more challenging with the epidemic impact of
   COVID-19. This research aims to investigate the mechanisms that delivers
   value management as part of the ``re-invent{''} strategy proposed by the
   Construction Leadership Council in the UK government to improve WLC for
   buildings. In addition to existing secondary data from the literature,
   primary data were attained using a focus group with six quantity
   surveyors from different cost consultancies in the UK to gather
   qualitative evidence using their experiences, perceptions, and key
   challenges they face when integrating VM. Findings revealed that value
   management is primarily being used as a cost-cutting tool, the majority
   of quantity surveyors lack knowledge of what it encompasses, hence the
   industry needs a more proactive strategy towards it. Analysis revealed
   that value management is primarily implemented as a cost-cutting
   solution, key stakeholders (e.g., facility managers) need to be
   integrated, and there is no standardised process to incorporate value
   management in projects. The study proposes a four-dimensional
   (governance and policies, sustainability, industry's best practice, and
   innovation and technology) strategy to facilitate more holistic
   considerations of value management post COVID-19. Future work looks into
   evaluating the strategy proposed while acknowledging different
   procurement routes.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Assessment of the energy associated with the material production,
   transportation and construction of buildings provides an opportunity for
   reducing the use of energy and improving sustainability. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) provides a platform to incorporate
   sustainability information in the design of buildings. However,
   interoperability of BIM with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools needs
   further investigation. Previous research in this area has either
   partially employed BIM; data was exported from the main BIM authoring
   tool and then auxiliary tools were utilized to evaluate the model,
   thereby causing a disconnect between the model and analysis resulting in
   non-interoperable systems, or has ignored the importance of retaining
   the LCA results within the BIM environment. To address this issue, this
   paper presents a framework to estimate the embodied energy content
   within the native BIM environment. The implementation of this framework
   is illustrated by the development of a tool for estimation of material
   embodied energy, transportation energy and construction energy. A
   prototype of the tool has been implemented on a case project to
   establish the workability of the framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a suitable method to analyse the
   environmental impact of buildings' design choices. However, the nature
   of the building design process leads to a dilemma when applying LCA in
   early phases. LCA can be fully performed only in the later design phases
   when complete information is available, but it is too costly to make
   changes. As a result, LCA is scarcely employed as a decision-making
   tool. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can assist LCA during the
   design process. So far, two different approaches are usually adopted to
   perform the BIM-based LCA of buildings. The first approach concerns
   performing LCA with a detailed BIM at the end of the building design
   process. The second approach involves simplified methodologies for early
   design stages with uncertain data. This study proposes a novel approach
   for applying a consistent BIM-led LCA from the early design stages to
   the detailed ones based on lower to higher level of accuracy. Since the
   BIM elements are specified with increasing level of detail in each
   design phase, the method uses different LCA databases for the Level of
   Developments (LODs) of the building elements. Accordingly, LCA
   calculations are based on mixing the databases in every design phase.
   This is possible as long as the databases use identical background data.
   The framework helps to provide consistent information for
   decision-making throughout the whole design process, both in the later
   design phases and early ones with a simplified BIM.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a worldwide effort to reduce carbon
   emissions from buildings. Operational energy (OE) reduction has been the
   main focus of the Industry as it accounts for a greater proportion of
   carbon emissions throughout the building life and is easier than
   embodied energy (EE) to predict. However, as OE is reduced, embodied
   energy and carbon emissions become more significant. Further to this,
   early-stage design decisions are crucial as they determine a significant
   portion of a building's life-cycle impacts and cannot easily be amended
   later in the life of a building. Currently though, there is a lack of
   legislation and guidance relating to embodied carbon (EC) in buildings.
   This, together with the UK construction industry fragmentation, creates
   a significant barrier to dealing with embodied carbon at the design
   stage. The UK Government has mandated the implementation of
   collaborative 3D BIM for all public-sector projects. This step aims to
   tackle cost and carbon emission reduction targets by encouraging the
   construction Industry to operate more collaboratively thereby enabling
   greater efficiency. Since BIM empowers communications and stores
   information into one single digital model it has the potential to enable
   whole-building EC calculations. This can facilitate EC calculation to be
   included in early-design stage. This paper looks at literature that
   relates to BIM and EC's role in early-stage design and draws conclusions
   on how BIM can enable EC calculation inclusion to early-stage design. It
   establishes a correlation between the matrix of information required for
   BIM and the information required for whole-building EC calculations.
   This research aims to reveal the actors and processes involved in
   providing this information and suggest the project stages that EC
   calculations should take place in early-stage design. The future benefit
   is to inform practice and policy to enable EC reduction through BIM in
   order to meet overall carbon targets.},

Title = {A Parametric BIM Framework to Conceptual Structural Design for Assessing
   the Embodied Environmental Impact},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Decisions made in the early design stage have a significant effect on a
   building's performance and environmental impact. In practice, a
   conceptual design is performed by an architect, while a structural
   engineer begins to work in later phases when the architectural concept
   has already evolved. However, the geometry and form of a building
   directly determine the type of structure and applicable materials;
   therefore, the conceptual design phase gives rise to examining
   alternative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating
   alternative structural solutions in the conceptual design phase and
   examining their embodied environmental impact by integrating parametric
   design and building information modeling (BIM). Rhinoceros and
   Grasshopper were used to develop the parametric script, which includes
   the generation of geometrical variations, the automatic definition of
   initial cross sections for the load-bearing elements based on in-built
   structural design approximations, the datasets for embodied
   environmental impact of the used building materials, the generation of
   life cycle inventory (LCI), the automatic calculation of life cycle
   assessment (LCA) results based on the geometry, and the conversion of
   the parametric model into building information model. The method was
   demonstrated using a case study of 48 different alternative solutions
   for an unheated warehouse made of steel frames. Based on the results,
   the areas with the greatest energy impact were identified. The case
   study analysis also illustrated that the applied cross section may have
   a significant effect on the impact categories. The results draw
   attention to the complexity of LCA calculations even in the case of a
   simple structure containing a limited number of variables, where
   parametric design can serve as an effective tool for a comprehensive
   environmental impact assessment.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development and steady advancement of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) technology in China, traditional 2D Digital
   Line Graphic (DLG) data cannot visually display rich 3D spatial
   information, and it is difficult to meet the needs of BIM forward
   design. Aiming at the increasing demand for 3D spatial data in municipal
   project design, this paper proposes a forward design method based on
   oblique photogrammetry reality model. Firstly, the Quadric Error Metrics
   (QEM) algorithm is used to lighten the reality model. Secondly, the
   standard model library of municipal facilities is built in CATIA, and
   the lightweight reality model is integrated into CATIA for fine
   restoration. The refined reality model can provide BIM designers with
   reference to features, geomorphology, etc., avoiding unreasonable
   spatial planning, no external reference to model monomers, and missing
   model space location information. It is convenient for designers to
   design, display, compare and modify the scheme in the same platform to
   improve the efficiency of BIM design. Change the delivery form of
   traditional surveying and mapping data results, and encourage designers
   to use BIM technology for forward design from surveying and mapping, and
   accelerate the popularization and promotion of BIM technology in the
   whole life cycle of the construction industry.},

Abstract = {The building sector represents one of the major sources of environmental
   impact due especially to space and domestic hot water heating and
   construction works. A number of studies focused so far on estimating the
   energy savings and carbon emissions reduction potential achievable by
   retrofitting urban building stocks, nevertheless a shift to life cycle
   assessment is needed to properly assess the environmental impacts in a
   more holistic way.
   The aim of this study is to develop a geospatial data model for the life
   cycle assessment of environmental impacts of building stocks at the
   urban scale. The methodology includes: geospatial processing of
   building-related data to characterize urban building stocks; a
   spatio-temporal database to store and manage data; life cycle assessment
   to estimate potential environmental impacts.
   The methodology was tested for a case study in Luxembourg and
   preliminary results regarding the retrofitting stage of residential
   buildings were provided for one entire city. The data model is part of a
   wider bottom-up framework being developed to support decision about
   building stock retrofitting for sustainable urban planning.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the building industry, as the main source of carbon
   emissions, has received extensive attention from various sectors of
   society in context of national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality
   goals. As a result, prefabricated buildings supported by Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) technology have been guiding the development
   of the industry towards new technologies and processes. Due to the
   gradual increase in building energy consumption and increasing severity
   of material waste, the government has begun to vigorously advocate and
   support prefabricated buildings. This paper takes prefabricated
   reinforced concrete structure buildings as the research object, starting
   from various stages of the building's entire life cycle, and explores
   the modern construction technology that combines BIM and prefabricated
   buildings. It analyzes the planning and analysis design, scheme
   coordination design, and deepening design of prefabricated components in
   design stage of prefabricated buildings based on BIM technology.
   Furthermore, it explores the application of intelligent technology and
   information technology in the entire life cycle of prefabricated
   buildings. Based on a deep understanding of theoretical knowledge and
   practical investigation of prefabricated buildings, this paper explores
   the application of BIM technology, proposes the feasibility and
   applicability of applying BIM technology to actual projects, and
   provides targeted recommendations.},

Abstract = {The advent of building information modelling (BIM) is revolutionising
   the conventional practices of the construction industry and has
   reinforced the impact of the design process on the building project's
   overall life cycle. The industry is also moving towards sustainability
   through owners being committed to having green rated buildings and
   infrastructure. However, green buildings and their rating systems face
   several obstacles and shortcomings that hinder their sustainability.
   Several studies have considered BIM for sustainability aspects, but
   these were not connected directly with such obstacles. This paper is a
   literature review that links the obstacles and shortcomings faced in
   green buildings and their associated rating systems with the potential
   capabilities of BIM. The limitations of BIM in the green building
   industry was also addressed. The main obstacles and shortcomings faced
   are high upfront costs and delays, design complexities and documentation
   requirements, superior performance enhancement requirements, and
   skewness towards environmental sustainability. The paper was written
   from a realisation that a more consolidated future research direction is
   needed in academic studies that address the quest for sustainability
   though BIM. Findings indicate future areas of BIM technology research
   include fully automating BIM-rating system integration, collaboration
   and intellectual property issues, and the unaccommodating contractual
   approaches for multiple party involvement needed in a BIM platform.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) enables firms in the architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry to transform the
   construction value chain into a technologically enhanced construction
   process. One of the fundamental concerns to emerge related to BIM
   adoption is how to implement BIM successfully. Thus, it is considered
   crucial to identify the key factors (KFs) that influence the success of
   BIM initiatives. This study is conducted to find the influence factors
   and also undertake an analysis in order to identify the KFs that would
   facilitate successful BIM adoption and implementation in Singapore. The
   research concluded that improved coordination, better accuracy in a
   faster timeframe, fewer on-site clashes and fewer change orders are the
   important benefits of BIM adoption. The research findings should help
   AEC firms to ensure the realisation of BIM adoption and implementation
   in the project life cycle. It should also help Singapore's government
   agencies to plan properly for supporting BIM adoption and implementation
   in the life cycle of construction projects.},

Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The construction industry is adopting a ground-breaking invention called
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) to virtually manage and plan
   projects throughout the building's lifespan. In the architectural,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) sector, the adoption of BIM is
   growing throughout the government sector worldwide, including
   governmental entities and non-profit organizations. This article covers
   how building information modelling was used to produce suggestions to
   help customers and operational teams appropriately specify information
   needs for projects. The ISO 19650 standards underline this as the first
   and most critical stage in ensuring that there is adequate information
   available to optimize constructed assets over the course of their whole
   life cycle. A study gap that was discovered was the absence of explicit
   recommendations aimed at helping customers determine their information
   needs as the appointing party. This research gives recommendations for a
   plan of action to identify needs and promote effective BIM project
   outcomes. Since Pakistan does not have a BIM standard, the authors
   recommended using ISO 19650 with minimum modification as Pakistan's BIM
   standard, as it offers a systemic framework in this regard. (c) 2023 THE

Title = {Integrated life-cycle optimisation and supply-side management for
   building retrofitting},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building retrofitting is a powerful approach to enhance building energy
   performance. The net-zero ambition urges the need to renovate building
   energy system in view of the life-cycle optimal, to address climate and
   environmental challenges. Existing retrofitting and optimisation
   solutions are generally based upon minimising operational energy or
   cost. However, although building retrofitting can reduce the energy use
   at the operating phase, additional materials would result in increased
   embodied energy. The objective of this paper is to devise a novel
   building retrofitting approach through the integration of life-cycle
   optimisation and supply-side management. It is an interactive two-set
   optimisation approach aimed at minimising overall life-cycle energy
   consumption through determining the optimal design configuration and
   operating plan of retrofitting energy devices. The essential
   retrofitting energy devices include passive retrofitting options (i.e.,
   photovoltaic panel and solar thermal collector) and active retrofitting
   options (i.e., biomass boiler, ground source heat pump, heat storage,
   electricity storage, and cogeneration system). A modern 3-floor office
   building in Manchester, the United Kingdom, is adopted to assess the
   performance of the proposed refurbishment approach. The real-world
   situation is represented by historical electricity and gas consumption
   profiles, current building design information, historical weather
   profile, as well as life-cycle inventory information. The proposed
   retrofitting optimisation approach can help decision-makers select the
   optimal retrofitting solution so as to reduce the overall life-cycle
   energy consumption of office buildings.},

Abstract = {Global warming has drastically increased the pressure to reduce energy
   use in buildings as reflected by a stringent regulatory landscape. The
   construction industry is expected to adopt new methods and strategies to
   address such requirements primarily focusing on reducing energy demand,
   improving process efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The
   realization of these emerging requirements has been constrained by the
   highly fragmented nature of the industry, often portrayed as involving a
   culture of ``adversarial relationships{''}, ``risk avoidance{''},
   exacerbated by a ``linear workflow{''}. Recurring problems include low
   process efficiency, delays and construction waste.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides a unique opportunity to
   enhance building energy efficiency and open new pathways towards a more
   digitalised industry and society. BIM is foreseen as a mean to waste and
   emissions reduction, performance gap minimization, in-use energy
   enhancements, and total lifecycle assessment. It also targets the whole
   supply chain related to design, construction as well as management and
   use of facility, at the different qualifications levels (including blue
   collar workers).
   This paper provides an evaluation of the key criterions and strategies
   that can promote BIM as an efficacious tool for facilitating energy
   efficiency. We explore how different use-cases variables influence the
   impact of BIM on energy efficiency and provide useful insights on how
   building lifecycle, discipline and buildings types can influence
   different BIM energy efficiency scenarios.},

Title = {Sensitivity analysis of design variables in life-cycle environmental
   impacts of buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large portion of global energy
   consumption and carbon emissions. Improvements in building design
   contribute to reducing environmental impacts of buildings. In this
   context, a crucial issue is to understand which design variables should
   be considered while which variables could be negligible. The objective
   of this study is to develop a framework for as-sessing the influence of
   various design variables throughout the design process in the
   environ-mental impacts of a building over its life cycle. This
   methodological framework combined build-ing information modelling and
   life cycle assessment tools and a global sensitivity analysis using the
   Morris elementary effects method. A residential building was applied to
   demonstrate the de-veloped framework. The influence of six design
   variables in early design stages (including, floor area, aspect ratio,
   floor height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio and number of floors),
   nine variables in detailed design stages (including, structure type of
   external and internal walls, type of insulation material for external
   and internal walls, insulation material for floors, waterproof-ing and
   insulation material for roof, type of window frame, and glazing type),
   and four variables in construction design stages (including, type of
   finishing for external walls, internal walls and floors, and roof tiles)
   are examined. Three environmental impact criteria (including, embodied,
   operational, and life-cycle environmental impacts) of a building are
   considered. The results iden-tified the most influential variables
   throughout the design process, highlighting aspect ratio in early design
   stage, the structure and insulation materials for walls in detailed
   design stages, and the roof title in construction design stages. The
   outcomes of this research can assist in under-standing the importance of
   design variables in each design stage throughout the design process of a
   building.},

Abstract = {Despite the promise of using building information modelling (BIM) during
   the whole life cycle of a building, there are only few studies of the
   actual uses of BIM and other information systems in facility management.
   We contribute to the discussion by analysing the Center for Properties
   and Facilities of the University of Helsinki. We ask (1) what kind of
   information tools for facility management the maintenance personnel use;
   (2) how the design data was handed over in the University's central
   library project; and (3) how designers and facility managers find the
   possibilities of integrating BIM models and maintenance information
   systems. In the library project, the data was handed over and archived
   for potential later use. The information for the maintenance manual,
   however, was collected separately by an outside consultant. The
   designers thought that models should be simplified to meet the needs of
   the maintenance. The representatives of the Center did not see that uses
   of BIM models would provide a significant added value in relation to the
   potential provided by the maintenance information systems already in
   use. They found as a possible next step the transfer of some information
   from BIM models to their facility management and maintenance systems. A
   partial, stepwise integration of the systems seems to be a realistic way
   forward.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is increasingly appropriate for
   infrastructure projects, and in particular for transport infrastructure.
   It is a digital solution that integrates the practices of the
   construction industry in facility management during the whole life
   cycle. This integration is possible through a single tool, which is the
   3D digital model. Nevertheless, BIM standards, such as industry
   foundation classes, are still in the pipeline for infrastructure
   management. These standards do not fully meet the requirements of
   operation and maintenance of transport infrastructure. This paper shows
   how BIM could be implemented to address issues related to the operation
   and maintenance phase for transport infrastructure management. For this
   purpose, a new ontological approach, called Industry Foundation Classes
   for Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructures (IFCInfra4OM), is
   detailed. This ontology aims to standardise the use of building
   information modelling for operation and maintenance in road
   infrastructures. To highlight the interest of the proposed ontological
   approach, a building information model of a section on the A7
   Agadir-Marrakech Highway in Morocco is produced according to
   IFCInfra4OM. The methodology is presented. The results obtained,
   including the IFCInfra4OM data model, are submitted. In the last
   section, an overview of the IFC extension approach is submitted.},

Title = {Estimating city-level energy consumption of residential buildings: A
   life-cycle dynamic simulation model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Pages = {451-462},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The residential building sector consumes a large amount of energy and is
   recognized as a high potential area where urban energy consumption and
   carbon emission can be reduced. To reduce the residential energy
   consumption, relevant policies and measures have been formulated in
   different places. However, due to the lack of adequate information in
   the process of policy formulation, the effectiveness of most
   energy-saving policies for residential buildings seems to be
   unsatisfactory. Although previous studies have analyzed the energy
   consumption for a single building or for the whole construction industry
   at the national level, few of them investigated the life-cycle energy
   consumption of residential buildings at the city level. Since municipal
   governments are the key implementers for the reduction of urban energy
   consumption, a city-level analysis on the energy consumption of
   residential buildings is highly needed for the policy making. To fill
   the research gap, this paper develops a life-cycle dynamic simulation
   model to fully reveal the characteristics of energy consumption of
   residential buildings at the city level. This easy-to-use model is
   validated by a case study of Beijing, which demonstrates its
   applicability and capability to help analyze multiple indicators of
   residential energy consumption and the dynamic trends of these
   indicators for municipal governments. Furthermore, the model can be used
   under the condition of limited input data, and can provide the situation
   analysis and simulation results of energy consumption of urban
   residential buildings for facilitating the policy making by municipal
   governments.},

Abstract = {Triple Bottom Line (TBL)-based project proposal evaluation is highly

   this study developed a BIM plugin toolkit to automate proposal
   evaluation of water supply infrastructure projects by considering the
   TBL performance. This toolkit incorporates a unique TBL-based evaluation
   methodology that integrates environmental product declarations, social
   life cycle impact, and life cycle costing. The case study revealed that
   the selected proposal had superior environmental and social performance
   while the bid price was slightly higher (6.5\%) than the lowest-cost
   proposal. The proposed method provides a user-friendly tool for
   TBL-based proposal evaluation and promotes BIM implementation in the

   House in Ecuador by Assessing LCC and LCEI},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The building industry significantly contributes to global warming,
   driving the demand for sustainable construction and green buildings.
   However, barriers like cost concerns and limited knowledge persist.
   Previous studies have used multi-objective optimization (MOO) to
   minimize life cycle cost and environmental impact, often emphasizing
   energy efficiency. In equatorial climates, unique factors like material
   selection must be considered. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness
   of sustainable materials, focusing on envelope materials in Ecuador. The
   case study is a single-family house in the equatorial climate, optimized
   using Building Information Modeling (BIM), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA),
   and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). In this study, a MOO process using
   the weighted sum approach (WSA) identifies sustainable house designs.
   The sustainable houses achieve a 98\% decrease in Ozone Depletion
   Potential, a 75\% reduction in Global Warming Potential, and a 45\% drop
   in Primary Energy Demand, although they still incur a 30\% increased
   cost. The results offer a foundation for cost-effective, eco-friendly
   housing solutions. Bamboo emerges as a promising material with local
   acceptance. This research highlights the significance of material
   selection in sustainable construction and provides a replicable approach
   for diverse settings. It aims to promote sustainable housing solutions
   in Ecuador and beyond.},

Pages = {1046-1060},

Abstract = {Building life cycle is a process which covers not only the construction
   phase but also the feasibility, the de- sign and the operation phases.
   Identifying the owner's needs in all phases of this process is of
   paramount importance for achieving satisfactory results for the building
   project. Additionally, the owner's needs should be fulfilled by the work
   scope of every stakeholder involved in the project. Nevertheless, these
   needs are not always adequately considered in building projects. Thus,
   the purpose of the research reported in this paper has been to develop a
   model that allows for the identification of the owner's needs in all
   phases of the building life cycle. The article presents a six level
   classifica- tion system for the information required in the project and
   a two-dimensional model that maps the life cycle and the logical actions
   to be undertaken in each phase. The model has been corroborated and
   improved by applying the Delphi technique to a panel of ten experts in
   two rounds. The practical use of the model is through the systematic
   application of a series of questionnaires built upon the information
   classification system for determining the owner's needs. The paper
   details the operation phase of the model as an illustrative example and
   a case study on a residential building project of twelve apartments in
   Spain.},

Title = {Decarbonization potentials of the embodied energy use and operational
   process in buildings: A review from the life-cycle perspective},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Accounting for one third of global energy-related carbon emissions, the
   construction and operation of buildings are crucial for mitigating
   climate change. Decarbonization potentials of embodied and operational
   energy use in buildings are worth exploring from a life-cycle
   perspective. This paper focuses on the individual building level and
   collects the latest cases, to offer a comprehensive and timely
   understanding of the assessment and reduction of building life cycle
   carbon emissions (LCCEs). As for the collected cases, the operational
   process accounts for the largest share of building LCCEs, averaging
   67\%, followed by the production and construction phase, averaging 31\%.
   Carbon emissions from the demolition process are relatively low,
   averaging 2\%. The most commonly used method for assessing LCCEs is
   process-based, combining the activity level and carbon emission factors.
   Advanced technologies such as building information modelling and
   building performance simulation have been employed in recent years to
   assess embodied and operational carbon emissions effectively. Different
   approaches are proposed for the decarbonization of each stage in the
   building life cycle. In the production stage, the effective approaches
   could be optimizing the building structure, improving the material
   performance, and using bio-based materials, etc. Prefabrication
   technology is helpful to decarbonize the construction process. Energy
   conservation and electrification, renewable energy integration, and
   smart energy management can effectively reduce the building's
   operational carbon emissions. Beyond the life cycle, recycling waste
   materials is proven to have great environmental benefits. Further
   studies are suggested to trade off the embodied and operational carbon,
   to fully explore building life-cycle decarbonization potentials.},

Abstract = {In recent years, building information modeling/model (BIM) has
   demonstrated its return on investment in design and construction. As a
   result, the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations
   (AECO) industry has expressed great interest in the use of BIM for
   facility management. Ideally, BIM models should serve as a full database
   for different purposes and functions during the project life cycle.
   However, in reality different stakeholders in the AECO industry are
   still working in their own silos and are hesitant to collaborate with
   each other. Unfortunately, facility owners are forced to pay extra costs
   to repurchase the as-built data for their facility management software
   after project delivery. Ironically, most of this data was already
   delivered to them in the BIM models. This paper aims to validate the
   feasibility of using BIM to populate facility maintenance software
   automatically in order to avoid unnecessary costs for facility owners. A
   case study of an administrative building is conducted for this database
   automation process. In addition, the case study compares the cost of BIM
   supported facility maintenance software population with the traditional
   assessment method. Potential savings of using BIM for database automated
   population are investigated.},

Title = {Application of Cloud Storage on BIM Life-cycle Management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Because of its high information intensity, strong consistency and
   convenient visualization features, building information modelling (BIM)
   has received widespread attention in the fields of construction and
   project management. However, due to large amounts of information, high
   integration, the need for resource sharing between various departments,
   the long time-span of the BIM application, challenges relating to data
   interoperability, security and cost all slow down the adoption of BIM.
   This paper constructs a BIM cloud storage concept system using cloud
   storage, an advanced computer technology, to solve the problem of mass
   data processing, information security, and cost problems in the existing
   application of BIM to full life-cycle management. This system takes full
   advantage of the cloud storage technique. Achievements are reached in
   four areas of BIM information management, involving security and
   licensing management, file management, work process management and
   collaborative management. The system expands the time and space scales,
   improves the level of participation, and reduces the cost of BIM. The
   construction of the BIM cloud storage system is one of the most
   important directions of the development of BIM, which benefits the
   promotion and further development of BIM to better serve construction
   and engineering project management.},

Title = {Influences of BIM-LOD and Geographic-Scale Environmental Impact Factors
   on embodied emissions: The Norwegian context},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {269},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), grounded in Building Information Modelling
   (BIM), plays a crucial role in minimizing emissions in the Architecture,
   Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector. However, the accuracy of LCA
   outcomes is significantly influenced by BIM's Level of Development (LOD)
   and Geographic-Scale Environmental Impact Factor (GS-EIF). Using a
   Norwegian Timber Building as a case study, this article explores the
   effects of BIM-LOD and GS-EIF on LCA embodied emissions of the life
   cycle stage from Cradle to Gate. The findings reveal that lower BIM-LOD
   levels, such as LOD 200, tend to underestimate environmental impacts
   compared to higher LOD levels, like LOD 350. For instance, Global
   Warming Potential (GWP) can increase by 142\% when movingfrom LOD 200 to
   LOD 350. Conversely, transitioning from Global Generic Environmental
   Impact Data (GLD) to Site Specific Environmental Impact Data (SFD), GWP
   can fall by up to 95\%. This underscores the critical role of using
   precise environmental impact data to enhance decision-making and improve
   a building's environmental performance. The study recommends starting
   with BIM-LOD 300 and Country-specific Regional EIF data (CRD) during the
   design development stages to balance accuracy and practicality. Tracking
   the transition along the BIM-LCA progress further strengthens the
   robustness of theLCA results. However, it is essential to note that the
   findings of this study are specific to Norwegian timber buildings and
   may not apply universally to other building types or materials.
   Therefore, further research is needed to validate these findings across
   different building structural types, geographic regions and
   environmental contexts.},

Title = {BIM uses for deconstruction: an activity-theoretical perspective on
   reorganising end-of-life practices},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {323-339},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Despite that Building Information Modelling (BIM) is often praised as a
   whole life-cycle methodology, possibilities for deconstruction are
   consistently overlooked. This study demonstrates what those
   possibilities may be. Previous studies showed that: deconstruction
   practices pose several site-based challenges; BIM implementations may
   help practitioners to address such challenges; and activity theory
   offers a framework to understand BIM implementations. We aimed to
   explore how deconstruction practices can be reorganised with BIM by
   applying an activity-theoretical perspective to a rather unique
   case-study. The selected case concerned the deconstruction of a nursing
   home so that many of its elements could be reused to construct a school.
   During this project, we implemented BIM in three essential activities:
   analysing existing conditions, labelling of reusable elements and
   planning deconstruction. The implementations resolved initial problems
   related with the use of traditional drawings, schedules and
   instructions. They nevertheless also triggered several additional
   problems that we attempted to address in successive steps. The
   organisation of the activities so evolved, which culminated in the
   formation of three new BIM uses for deconstruction: ``3D existing
   conditions analysis,{''} ``reusable elements labelling{''} and ``4D
   deconstruction simulation{''}. These concepts complement existing BIM
   use taxonomies and can be appropriated in future deconstruction
   projects.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is facilitating a procedural change
   for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to
   share information in all the phases of the life cycle of a building. It
   possesses great advantages in designing, analyzing, and documenting all
   physical and functional information of a building and construction
   project. Structural analysis is an integral part of the life cycle
   phases of building construction projects. The information needed for
   structural analysis originates from the architectural model, but the
   architectural model can be created without much consideration of
   structural analysis. Software tools used by architects and structural
   engineers are usually different and sustain information inconsistency
   and or missing information leading to software interoperability
   problems. As the first step towards addressing this issue, in this
   paper, the authors conducted a preliminary literature review in order to
   identify topics and trends on the BIM interoperability problem with a
   focus on the structural analysis domain, from both the theoretic
   perspective and the application perspective. Structural analysis is
   performed and discussed in the following sections to demonstrate
   interoperability problems and propose possible solutions.},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a quantitative tool used to evaluate the
   environmental impacts of products or processes. With respect to
   buildings, LCA can be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of an
   entire building's life cycle. Currently LCA in the building area is used
   in a limited capacity, primarily to select building products. In order
   to determine the causality for the lack of whole-building LCAs, focus
   groups with members of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   (AEC) communities were held. This article investigates the current level
   of knowledge of LCA in the AEC community and then discusses the benefits
   and barriers to the practice of LCA. In summary, the goal of the
   research was to identify why LCA is not used to its fullest potential in
   a whole-building LCA. In an open forum and moderated setting, focus
   group participants were asked individually to self-identify their
   experience with LCA, a brief education session on LCA was held, and then
   benefits and barriers to LCA were discussed. The focus group sessions
   were transcribed and systematically coded by social researchers in order
   to analyze the results. Hybrid flow and radar charts were developed.
   From the focus group results, the most important benefit to LCA was
   provides information about environmental impacts. The results did not
   identify a prominent barrier; however, building-related metrics were
   ascertained to be one of the more crucial barriers. The benefits and
   barriers classified by this analysis will be utilized to develop a
   subsequent online survey to further understand the LCA and AEC
   community.},

Title = {A design tool to assess the heating energy demand and the associated
   financial and environmental impact in neighbourhoods},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {516-523},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {During the master planning of neighbourhoods, design decisions related
   to the urban layout and typology affect the building form and
   availability of solar radiation considerably. The influence of those
   decisions on the energy demand for heating is often neglected however
   because appropriate energy simulation tools are lacking.
   This paper proposes a simple and accurate design tool to assess the
   solar gains and heating energy demand in buildings during the master
   planning phase of neighbourhoods. Detailed information on building
   geometry, constituting building elements and solar obstructions, is
   extracted from a 3D neighbourhood model using a plugin implemented in
   the modelling software SketchUp. This information is used to assess the
   heating energy demand of the buildings in the neighbourhood based on the
   dynamic Equivalent Heating Degree Day (dEHDD) method. Furthermore, the
   associated financial and environmental impacts are calculated based on
   an integrated life cycle approach, combining Life Cycle Costing (LCC)
   and Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) respectively. The design
   tool proposed is implemented for the Belgian context and used to analyse
   a number of schematic residential neighbourhood models with diverse
   built densities. The analysis reveals substantial differences in heating
   energy demand, life cycle financial and environmental costs.
   Neighbourhoods with a high built density and compact building types have
   a lower heating energy demand with potential reductions of up to 40\%
   compared to neighbourhoods with a low built density and detached
   building types. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {User participation is a key element in decision processes concerning the
   accommodation of dynamic organisations such as schools. This article
   addresses the discrepancy between the perspectives of the architects and
   engineers, as the makers of school buildings, and school management,
   teachers and students, as the users of the buildings, and proposes that
   productive and efficient participatory design of school buildings
   requires appropriate information tools. Visual information technology
   tools, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), already used in
   interaction between architects, engineers, consultants, etc., are
   proposed to support school managers, teachers and students in
   participating in all stages of the life cycle of their school building.
   The proposed use of BIM is compared to a retrospective analysis of a
   Dutch school which realised a completely new secondary education
   building. The article concludes with recommendations to increase the
   impact of visual information technology tools such as BIM in the design
   of school buildings in Europe and beyond.},

Title = {Dynamic life cycle assessment: framework and application to an
   institutional building},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {538-552},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper uses a dynamic life cycle assessment (DLCA) approach and
   illustrates the potential importance of the method using a simplified
   case study of an institutional building. Previous life cycle assessment
   (LCA) studies have consistently found that energy consumption in the use
   phase of a building is dominant in most environmental impact categories.
   Due to the long life span of buildings and potential for changes in
   usage patterns over time, a shift toward DLCA has been suggested.
   We define DLCA as an approach to LCA which explicitly incorporates
   dynamic process modeling in the context of temporal and spatial
   variations in the surrounding industrial and environmental systems. A
   simplified mathematical model is used to incorporate dynamic information
   from the case study building, temporally explicit sources of life cycle
   inventory data and temporally explicit life cycle impact assessment
   characterization factors, where available. The DLCA model was evaluated
   for the historical and projected future environmental impacts of an
   existing institutional building, with additional scenario development
   for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of future impacts.
   Results showed that overall life cycle impacts varied greatly in some
   categories when compared to static LCA results, generated from the
   temporal perspective of either the building's initial construction or
   its recent renovation. From the initial construction perspective,
   impacts in categories related to criteria air pollutants were reduced by
   more than 50 \% when compared to a static LCA, even though nonrenewable
   energy use increased by 15 \%. Pollution controls were a major reason
   for these reductions. In the future scenario analysis, the baseline DLCA
   scenario showed a decrease in all impact categories compared with the
   static LCA. The outer bounds of the sensitivity analysis varied from
   slightly higher to strongly lower than the static results, indicating
   the general robustness of the decline across the scenarios.
   These findings support the use of dynamic modeling in life cycle
   assessment to increase the relevance of results. In some cases, decision
   making related to building design and operations may be affected by
   considering the interaction of temporally explicit information in
   multiple steps of the LCA. The DLCA results suggest that in some cases,
   changes during a building's lifetime can influence the LCA results to a
   greater degree than the material and construction phases. Adapting LCA
   to a more dynamic approach may increase the usefulness of the method in
   assessing the performance of buildings and other complex systems in the
   built environment.},

Abstract = {Use of life-cycle costing (LCC) is a highly relevant method for
   determination of best value investment. LCC requires increased
   information compared to traditional building cost calculations. Use of
   building information modelling (BIM) based software should therefore
   lead to a high increase in LCC calculations for every project. However,
   this is not the case. The purpose of this study is to understand why
   BIM-based LCC calculations are not used more often. Integrated design
   and delivery solutions (IDDS) from CIB are used as a framework to
   explore practical use of LCC. IDDS focus on collaborating people,
   integrated processes and interoperable technology. This study is based
   on a combination of exploring BIM-based software, literature review and
   semi structured interviews with relevant stakeholders in building and
   civil engineering projects. The study identifies a gap between the
   process, the people, and the technology. Increased use of LCC
   calculations would benefit from increased integration rather than
   development of separate factors. IDDS has proven to be useful in
   understanding factors involved in practical use of BIM-based LCC
   calculations.},

Title = {Optimal BIM and LCA integration approach for embodied environmental
   impact assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {385},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that applications of building
   information modeling (BIM) can facilitate the effectiveness of embodied
   environmental impact assessment of buildings. Various approaches for
   integrating BIM software and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools have been
   developed in recent years. However, limited research has been conducted
   in defining appropriate BIM-LCA integration approaches for embodied
   environmental impact assessment. To address this issue, this research
   develops a way of selecting the optimal BIM-LCA integration approach
   that incorporates the needs of different scenarios for the performance
   of the integration approach. Three scenarios of environmental impact
   assessment are designed to demonstrate the application of the proposed
   way, including 1) environmental impact assessment in early design stage,
   2) environmental impact assessment in the detailed design stage, and 3)
   environmental impact assessment in construction design stage. The
   demonstration results indicate that the method of ``using visual
   programming languages{''} is the optimal BIM-LCA integration approach
   for assessing environmental impacts in the early and construction design
   stages. The methods of ``adopting LCA plugin for BIM-software{''} and
   ``using visual programming languages{''} are the optimal approaches for
   environmental assessment in the scenario of detailed design stages. This
   research assists LCA practitioners in selecting optimal BIM-LCA
   integration approaches in different scenarios and further promotes the
   applications of BIM-LCA integration approaches during the whole design
   process of a building.},

Abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization and the rapid development of the
   construction industry, the rapid consumption of human resources and
   earth resources and the destruction of the human ecological environment
   have become increasingly prominent. According to the latest statistics,
   China has nearly 40 billion square meters of completed buildings, of
   which the proportion of high-energy-consuming buildings is as high as
   95\%, and the number of high-energy-consuming buildings continues to
   increase every year. Such a huge building energy consumption is bound to
   become a major burden for China, restricting the development of the
   national economy, and also affecting people's quality of life.
   Therefore, the state should actively and effectively promote the
   research and development of energy-saving buildings. In this study, a
   BIM building information model that can reflect the environmental
   benefits of green buildings is established, and the green building of a
   project apartment building is used as an empirical research object to
   simulate and analyze the environmental benefits of its entire life

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is a serious information gap between different life-cycle stages
   and different BIM platforms, semantic enrichment (SE) for BIM is an
   important solution to address this issue. Therefore, semantically rich
   BIM models are of great significance for efficient construction
   management and BIM is facing higher semantic requirements. It is
   necessary to conduct SE for BIM according to the requirements of
   specific domains. There is still a lack of in-depth analysis and summary
   of the content, methods, and applications of SE for BIM in different
   stages during the life cycle of facilities, therefore this paper gives a
   comprehensive review of SE for BIM to analyze the status quo and trends
   from content, methods, and applications. The content and four methods of
   SE for BIM are summa-rized. The pros, cons, and applicability of each
   method are analyzed. Applications of SE for BIM in the life cycle of
   facilities are discussed comprehensively. Finally, this paper discusses
   the enabling technologies, Level of Development (LOD) and SE for BIM,
   and presents research gaps and future directions.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an emerging technology which is
   expected to improve building refurbishments throughout the life cycle of
   an existing building facility. Refurbishment projects accounts for over
   50 percent of cost of the project throughout the life cycle of an
   existing facility, thus requiring a sustainable platform to holistically
   address and manage such an enormity. BIM is increasingly being
   identified as an innovative technology, with the potential to streamline
   processes in refurbishment building projects, however, its application
   is marred with several risk factors impacting its adoption in New
   Zealand. This research study gleaned into the current literature to
   understand the perceptions and the risks in BIM adoption and then using
   a case study of a complex multipurpose building project facility,
   proposes risk-response strategies for BIM adoption. An exploratory
   interpretative methodology incorporating semi - structured interviews

Abstract = {The construction industry is considered as one of the most dynamic
   sectors that have upstream and downstream economic links and has been
   growing rapidly in the last few decades. On the other hand, it is
   considered as one of the main sources of greenhouse gases where
   construction projects represent a huge portion of sources producing
   carbon dioxide gases (CO2). Furthermore, greenhouse gases (GHG) are one
   of construction emissions that should be investigated to calculate the
   overall emissions. Therefore, estimating construction emissions is very
   important in order to keep emissions at an acceptable level. This paper
   presents a building information modeling (BIM)-based model that enables
   the estimation of six types of emissions including: greenhouse gases,
   sulfur dioxide, particular matter, eutrophication particles, ozone
   depleting particles and smog. As such, the total direct and indirect
   emissions can be calculated where these emissions are produced from
   construction activities during the overall project life cycle phases
   which are: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction
   phase, operation phase, maintenance phase, and deconstruction/demolition
   phase. The methods of calculating direct and indirect emissions are
   extensively described in the paper. A case study is presented to
   illustrate the use of the proposed BIM -based model. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {A facility passes through several life cycle phases: conceptual design,
   design development, construction, use, reuse, remodeling, and
   demolition. In each phase, documents are created by architects,
   engineers, technical planners, and contractors that reflect the
   facility's state at certain points in time. Information exchange is
   achieved with commercial or open data exchange standards. Using building
   information modeling ( BIM), complex three-dimensional and semantically
   rich building models are feasible that facilitate planning and data
   exchange in project teams and through the whole lifecycle. Such models
   have significant potential not only for design and construction, but
   also to improve building operation. This paper investigates how BIM may
   be applied to improve operational efficiency in facilities. More
   specifically, the aim is to achieve improved reporting and visualization
   of energy and comfort related parameters, as well as their engineering
   and commissioning, by application of BIM in combination with building
   energy management systems ( BEMS). We present use cases that will guide
   the development of a novel dynamic BIM concept in which facility data
   are combined with building management system data. As a conclusion, an
   analysis of the feasibility of the use cases in terms of information
   availability is provided.},

Title = {BIM-FM integrated solution resourcing to digital techniques},
Journal = {NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 2},
Abstract = {The facility management (FM) has been suffering significant changes
   since the introduction of building information modeling (BIM) in the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sector.
   However, there are still challenges in BIM implementation during the
   building use phase, such as the difficulties related to the
   personalization of the maintenance management information for each case,
   and modeling the as-built conditions. Disclosing building data to all
   the stakeholders involved in the building life cycle is also a
   challenging task. So, this paper aims to present an integrated solution
   for BIM-FM to categorize and prioritize maintenance management, with the
   resource to digital techniques. For this purpose, the methodology
   developed consists of 1-the recognition and preparation of the site
   conditions; 2-Image collection using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV);
   3-Image processing and software comparison; 4-Obtaining point cloud and
   its integration in a BIM software; 5-3D building modeling in Revit
   software, 5-Damage detection through Photogrammetry Point Cloud, and
   6-Placement of building anomalies by means of placeholders. This work
   allows exploring BIM-FM representation and data integration for building
   condition assessment and its representation in a collaborative tool.
   This methodology will enhance the usability of BIM methodology in FM
   since it allows the data update in the model, avoids the information
   loss or fragmentation of the building life cycle and gives access to BIM
   users and non-users.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research
   trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research.
   Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current
   research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review
   methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research
   publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and
   retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA
   applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research.
   Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified,
   which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and
   discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively
   control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such
   mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new
   generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and
   continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective
   operation and management strategies of buildings and districts.
   Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system
   modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant
   emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently
   missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life
   cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent
   characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA
   results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept
   of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and
   spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and
   thus more effectively promotes a ``cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation{''}
   environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to
   leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic
   models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable
   environmental assessments.},

Abstract = {To conduct an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of buildings,
   the potential benefits of coupling LCA and Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) has gained a lot of attention among researchers
   recently. The expected efficiency gains, mainly coming from establishing
   the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) in an automated way, can improve the
   process significantly. However, the application of BIM and building
   model's varying Levels of Development (LOD) have implications on how the
   LCI should be structured and which LCA datasets can be used. The
   structure and completeness as well as granularity of a building model
   have to be clarified before deciding for the assessment workflow and
   tools used. Aiming for an efficient yet complete assessment, the
   implications of a workflow of establishing the LCI in Revit are
   discussed, refining the inventory in Excel and finally assessing the
   complete building in SimaPro. The study discusses the potentials,
   challenges and learnings from two BIM-LCA case studies investigated as
   part of the PEF4buildings project and presents the workflow developed
   based on these case studies.},

Abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable
   materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of
   carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural
   resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major
   contributor towards climate change and given that the construction
   industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial
   to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the
   context of developing countries. This research presents a novel
   framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information
   modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information
   systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize
   construction's design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and
   waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in
   Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and
   a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have
   been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of
   available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied
   emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to
   disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses.
   Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an
   optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization
   tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The
   case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the
   results show that 29.35\% of the materialization stage, 16.04\% of the
   operational stage, and 21.14\% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions
   can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental
   degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle
   might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective
   environmental impacts.},

   Performance via Use of Neural Networks and BIM},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Volume = {9},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Building energy performance tools are widely used to simulate the
   expected energy consumption of a given building during the operation
   phase of its life cycle. Deviations between predicted and actual energy
   consumptions have however been reported as a major limiting factor to
   the tools adopted in the literature. A significant reason highlighted as
   greatly influencing the difference in energy performance is related to
   the occupant behaviour of the building. To enhance the effectiveness of
   building energy performance tools, this study proposes a method which
   integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) with artificial neural
   network model for limiting the deviation between predicted and actual
   energy consumption rates. Through training a deep neural network for
   predicting occupant behaviour that reflects the actual performance of
   the building under examination, accurate BIM representations are
   produced which are validated via energy simulations. The proposed method
   is applied to a realistic case study, which highlights significant
   improvements when contrasted with a static simulation that does not
   account for changes in occupant behaviour.},

Title = {Building sustainability through a novel exploration of dynamic LCA
   uncertainty: Overview and state of the art},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {264},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment is necessary for evaluating the environmental
   impacts of buildings throughout their life cycle, considering factors
   such as energy consumption, emissions, and resource utilization.
   However, Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment introduces a temporal dimension,
   acknowledging that a building's environmental performance evolves due to
   technological advancements, occupancy behavior, and changing
   environmental conditions. This paper reviews DLCA, focusing on
   uncertainties arising from parameter, scenario, and model variability,
   and emphasizes the integration of technologies like Building Information
   Modeling, the Internet of Things, and machine learning to enhance
   real-time data collection and predictive analytics. An extensive review
   of 430 papers, refined to 180, reveals that 55 \% of publications are in
   environmental sciences, with significant contributions from the United
   Kingdom (27.8 \%), France (24.1 \%), and China (18.1 \%). Key findings
   include significant variations in embodied greenhouse gas emissions for
   materials like aluminum and the dynamic aspects of transportation
   impacts, which extend beyond traditional metrics to include operational
   efficiency over time. Uncertainties in all LCA stages (A1 to D) are
   addressed, focusing on service life, operational energy and water use,
   and transportation needs. Advanced methodologies, including a proposed
   framework for a hybrid LCA approach that integrates process-based and
   input-output methods, are suggested to enhance the comprehensiveness of
   assessments. The integration of real-time monitoring and predictive
   analytics further improves the adaptability and precision of LCA models,
   emphasizing the necessity of continuous updates and scenario analyses to
   capture future conditions accurately. This study paves the way for
   future research aimed at mitigating major sources of uncertainty,
   promoting more sustainable building practices, and advancing the field
   of dynamic LCA.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is one of the key technologies in
   the building and real estate industry and will have a great impact on
   the value chain of all stakeholders along the building sector. BIM
   methodology supports the overall building life cycle in which
   mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) plays a central role.
   Properties such as the energy consumption and operating costs of a
   building are fundamentally determined by the quality of MEP planning and
   implementation. Studies have shown that open data interfaces such as
   industry foundation classes (IFC) and the interoperability between
   different software environments are particularly important for MEP
   planning Several research studies show that openBIM data models for MEP
   are not yet fully applicable in real world projects. This paper explores
   which metadata is needed - and when - for BIM to deliver its benefits in
   the building life cycle. Furthermore, the use case building energy
   performance (BEP) simulation is investigated to identify the gap between
   the current capability to use IFC for MEP planning and BEP simulation,
   based on a typical hydronic heating system.},

Abstract = {Airports play an essential role within the transportation and
   infrastructure sectors. As modernizing and expanding airport
   infrastructures receive a higher priority, addressing inefficiencies in
   capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) through
   transformative digital ecosystems is gaining an increasing level of
   interest. Building information modeling (BIM) can form a basis to enable
   an end-to-end digital delivery platform, where airport life cycle data
   can be utilized for actionable insights. This study proposes a scalable,
   novel BIM-based modularized platform architecture based on model-based
   system engineering (MBSE) principles with systems modeling language
   (SysML) for optimal collection, integration, management, and utilization
   of airport critical asset data. This platform architecture aims at
   acting as a metaframework that enables an airport digital twin through
   cohesive and structured view of asset life cycle information for
   insightful actions by major airport stakeholders. Research methodology
   features an online survey and focus group discussions for data
   collection; mixed method analysis for data analysis; MBSE with SysML for
   data mapping; and prototype demonstration and an expert opinion survey
   for validation. Adopting a scalable BIM-based digital platform is
   anticipated to result in boosts in business value of airport
   infrastructures by sustaining value generation in operations and
   decreasing upfront costs for technology implementation.},

Abstract = {The preliminary design phase transforms the investor's ideas and
   information into general plans, drawings and specifications and helps
   the project managers continue the next steps in the projects. Material
   selection is an essential task to incorporate sustainable content into
   the construction industry. This paper reviewed materials selection
   studies and proposed a comprehensive method to compare the economic
   performance of construction material alternatives in this phase. The
   article constructed a life cycle costing equation used in the
   preliminary design stage that compared the total expected cost of the
   alternatives throughout the road construction project life cycle. The
   proposed life cycle cost method was divided into two scenarios according
   to the available information in the preliminary design phase and the
   material-dependent costs. A case study in Vietnam about the selection
   between baked bricks and concrete bricks was presented to demonstrate
   the proposed equations and models. The result showed that the baked
   bricks took the top priority due to the differences in cost items (e.g.,
   transportation costs). Furthermore, to validate the models, they were
   applied to compare the expected and actual cost of 18 road construction
   projects in Vietnam - the differences are all below 10\%. Further
   research may focus on building a database of models by applying the
   Building Information Model (BIM).},

Abstract = {The lack of integration between the digital and physical world results
   in a lower level of efficiency and collaboration in the construction
   industry. Digital twin technology, which creates a visual and digital
   model of a corresponding physical object for simulating, monitoring,

   considered as an effective solution to address these problems. This
   research proposes a framework to utilize digital twins and extend the

   operation principle and mechanism of digital twins, including the
   digital representation based on BIM, Internet of Things (IoT), data
   storage, integration, and analytics, as well as interaction with the
   physical environment. Questionnaires and interview results verify that
   the proposed framework can support construction site monitoring and
   management, enhance quality and efficiency, and improve construction
   safety. It also acknowledges the contribution of LoDs' extension to
   construction site management. The interviews underline the main

Abstract = {Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is an integrated method that
   combines environmental, economic, and social assessments. Its
   methodological development remains under discussion, mainly regarding
   the building design. This paper aims to provide a systematic,
   interoperable, and open-source approach towards implementing LCSA in
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) in five steps. A harmonized data
   structure that enriches BIM objects is proposed. Automation in the
   principal evaluation step is provided by integrating new parameters into
   the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC4). A Dynamo script verifies
   its utility in a case study in Spain using real-time calculations and
   visualizations. Two alternative structural systems are assessed, and
   identification is made of the lowest CO2 emitter, the lowest cost, and
   the most beneficial system for local employment. The approach can be
   employed to evaluate other indicators and building systems in other
   countries. Challenges and limitations in the standardization and
   harmonization of the three dimensions are identified.},

   have been trying to address this issue by the use of Building

   insufficient understanding of the methodological approaches and tools
   best suited to carry out environmental analysis. The novelty of the
   paper is to compare the paradigms and scope of most common used BIM and

Title = {As built case studies for BIM as conflicts detection and documentation
   tool},
Journal = {COGENT ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {As built documentation provide critical information that is needed
   during and afterward the construction. This process serve as a
   foundation upon which all changes, modifications or otherwise, made
   during the construction so that it can quickly obtain information about
   any design change. After construction, it serve as ready information
   source about what was actually built. Conflicts of the design documents
   with as built is crucial aspect of construction projects in order to
   prevent excessive cost of delays and work correction during operation
   and maintenance or renovation phases. Traditional documentation method
   sometime fails to serve in managing the development, rehabilitation and
   renovation of existing buildings. The lack of appropriate documents,
   change orders and as built-drawing for existing buildings are very
   common. These obstacles can be solved by the collaboration of all
   stakeholders at different phases of the project life cycle to insert,
   extract, update or amend related information. Since Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) has the potential to create a single model that offers
   visualization, clash detection, construction phases, and materials and
   testing together, this research will utilize the ability of BIM through
   case studies to address the conflicts detection through the project
   life-cycle. The results illustrates the main conflicts that had detected
   between the existing buildings and the available construction documents.
   The results of the two case studies prove that BIM model was very
   correlated to as built in term of quantities take off (coefficient was
   95.8 and 99.8\%) and in the final shop drawing. Also, the root mean
   square error was very little for BIM model (RMSE was 7.17 and 6.65)
   compared with traditional process for the quantities estimation compared
   with traditional process (RMSE was 43.75 and 47.33). These indications
   refer to high accuracy of BIM as a powerful tool for the
   re-documentation of existing building and their conflicts detection.},

Title = {A data-driven life-cycle optimisation approach for building
   retrofitting: A comprehensive assessment on economy, energy and
   environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A novel data-driven life-cycle optimisation approach is proposed for
   building retrofitting. The innovation points include big-data
   information, integrated retrofitting design, and life-cycle optimisation
   through a comprehensive assessment of the economy, energy and
   environment. The optimal retrofitting plan is selected to maximise its
   life-time cost-saving, energy reduction and carbon reduction. The
   proposed retrofitting optimisation approach is tested on a real-world
   building. The standard retrofitting options include roof insulation,
   wall insulation, wind turbine, solar heater, biomass boiler, combined
   heat and power system and photovoltaic panel. The historical energy
   consumption, building information, historical weather data, and
   inventory data is adopted in the data driven model to replicate the
   real-world case. Although building retrofitting would increase economic,
   energy and environmental effects at the beginning of its life-cycle due
   to increased investment cost, embodied energy and carbon of retrofitting
   materials, the overall life-cycle cost, energy and carbon would be lower
   than those non retrofitted buildings. It is found that envelope
   insulation has the lowest unit return cost, energy and carbon, followed
   by the solar heater, combined heat and power system, biomass boiler,
   wind turbine and photovoltaic panel. Through the optimal retrofitting
   plan, 39\% life-time cost-saving, 55\% life-time energy reduction and
   59\% life-time carbon reduction can be achieved at an investment cost of
   1.32 pound x 10(6).},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from construction processes are a serious
   concern globally. Of the several approaches taken to assess emissions,
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based methods do not just take into account
   the construction phase, but consider all phases of the life cycle of the
   construction. However, many current LCA approaches make general
   assumptions regarding location and effects, which do not do justice to
   the inherent dynamics of normal construction projects. This study
   presents a model to assess the embodied energy and associated GHG
   emissions, which is specifically adapted to address the dynamics of
   infrastructure construction projects. The use of the model is
   demonstrated on the superstructure of a prefabricated bridge. The
   findings indicate that Building Information Models/Modeling (BIM) and
   Discrete Event Simulation (DES) can be used to efficiently generate
   project-specific data, which is needed for estimating the embodied
   energy and associated GHG emissions in construction settings. This study
   has implications for the advancement of LCA-based methods (as well as
   project management) as a way of assessing embodied energy and associated
   GHG emissions related to construction.},

Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {491-503},
Abstract = {Purpose Aiming to simplify the extraction of embodied carbon data using
   a building information modeling (BIM) software, the purpose of this
   paper is to present a framework that integrates BIM and life cycle
   assessment (LCA), which are useful to the architecture, engineer and
   construction (AEC) industry. As a further purpose, this study also tests
   four different wall systems.
   Design/methodology/approach The study applies design science research
   and it presents a framework that integrates BIM and LCA. For analysis
   and validation, a case study features four different wall systems costs
   based on the Brazilian context. In the proposed framework, SimaPro8
   accomplishes the LCA, while ArchiCAD 19 the modeling.
   Findings The first analysis covers embodied carbon and the second covers
   the total cost of each m(2) of wall. The proposed framework performs
   well, and it is effective in the Brazilian context. Concerning the
   walls, the wood frame system is the most sustainable option within this
   analysis and the most financially feasible option in Brazil.
   Originality/value The present study contributes to embodied carbon data
   analysis, ensuring that the best choice of elements and components is
   being used in the building project. This BIM-LCA integrated solution is
   valuable not only to the AEC industry and to professionals, but also to
   future researchers. This analysis is of great value to new ventures,
   since the society shows a great concern about reducing GHGs emissions.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is widely considered to be leading
   the digital transformation of the AEC industry because of its data
   management capabilities among different stakeholders and across the
   building life-cycle. Fire safety engineering (FSE) is one of the
   disciplines that has been excluded for a long time from integrated
   approaches such as BIM, even though ensuring fire safety is a
   fundamental aspect of building performance. This paper presents a
   systematic literature review of BIM-FSE integration methodologies to
   highlight its potentialities for building life-cycle management and the
   digital transformation of the AEC domain. The findings show that the
   majority of BIM-FSE applications are focused on fire and evacuation
   simulations, followed by detection, monitoring and real-time emergency
   management. Technologies that are often involved in BIM-based fire
   safety solutions are CFD-based technologies, game- augmented and virtual
   reality, and the internet of things. Native formats are the most used
   for data sharing, while open standards still lack adequate data
   structures for FSE applications. The review highlights the benefits,
   embedded potentialities and limitations of the BIM-FSE integration in a
   decade of research studies. Future research directions for the digital
   transformation of FSE through BIM are proposed in a research agenda.},

Title = {Sustainable Building Standards, Codes and Certification Systems: The
   Status Quo and Future Directions in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Sustainable building practices are a response to environmental issues.
   Businesses and industries are assessing how their activities affect the
   environment. The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industries have significant impacts on the environment and economy,
   while the industry is considered one of the largest contributors to
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and has, therefore, been highlighted by
   researchers as a key area of intervention with a great potential to
   reduce environmental impacts. This paper critically reviews and
   evaluates the current state of sustainable building certification
   systems with the purpose of having a good understanding of the status
   quo and possibilities for future directions in Saudi Arabia. It reviews
   the academic literature on Saudi Arabia's green/sustainable building
   codes, standards, certification systems, methods and tools. It starts by
   addressing sustainability in the broadest sense. Then, it investigates
   sustainability strategies and evaluates the building certification
   systems in Saudi Arabia, followed by an introduction to the new practice
   of sustainable healthcare building assessment. Life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and building information modelling (BIM) techniques have also been
   investigated. The paper introduces the updated Saudi Building Code (SBC)
   with further evaluation of the Saudi Green Building Code (SBC 1001-CR).
   Finally, the paper clearly highlights the key role of sustainable
   building practices and the need to develop a certification system that
   considers the new trends and the local context.},

Abstract = {As a witness of history, built heritage has many values that is very
   important to human being. Therefore, how to conserve this valuable
   information becomes a common issue for cultural heritage conservation in
   the world. Many researches about conserving the information of within
   built heritages were done and more issues were raised. The difference
   between built heritage and new building is that built heritage is not
   from 0 but it is already exist. This difference cause a big different
   for modelling process of built heritage in BIM environment. For this
   reason, the information of the 3D model of built heritage is added to
   the model after the it was created. So, what information should be
   conserve and what information should be provided to which user is worth
   of discussion. This research aims to propose a data structure, which
   fulfils the requirement of user, and respect the standard of important
   international chart of conservation. The method is to define a basic
   data structure of built heritage components and evaluate it layer by
   layer. The result shows that HBIM for built heritage, by linking
   information, can store more important information and take the LoI of
   life cycle into consideration simultaneously. The prototypical schema of
   this study may possibly be an upper layer concept for later researches
   in both Western and Eastern built heritage.},

Title = {BIM Integrated LCA for Promoting Circular Economy towards Sustainable
   Construction: An Analytical Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sustainable construction is widely regarded as one of the best decisions
   to reduce the environmental impact of the buildings. Numerous scientific
   efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainability by adopting
   different techniques such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and building
   information modeling (BIM). The recent circular economy (CE) agenda is
   prioritizing in different sectors including construction due to
   increasing concern on the materials efficiency and resources
   consumption. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the implications,
   considerations, contributions and challenges of BIM integrated LCA and
   the CE adoption in the industry by critically analyzing the recent
   literature. A scientometric analysis was applied to the selected studies
   to show the knowledge among BIM, LCA and CE relationships. With a
   comprehensive analysis of major challenges and opportunities of LCA and
   BIM for construction sustainability, key drivers for sustainable
   building design were identified and analyzed. A prospective integrated
   framework for CE adoption into BIM-based LCA of buildings and an
   evaluation method are proposed by analyzing the contemporary issues. It
   is believed that the analyzed critical issues, identified future
   research direction and proposed frameworks and this methodology should
   contribute to effective implementation of CE into the building for
   promoting sustainable construction.},

Title = {Sustainable assessment of concrete structures using BIM-LCA-AHP
   integrated approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 12},
Abstract = {Recently, sustainability has become one of the most critical goals to be
   accomplished in the construction industry to mitigate its environmental
   impacts, energy consumption, waste, and cost. Therefore, this research
   aims to assess the sustainability of concrete structures using the
   Building Information Modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (BIM-LCA)
   approach. It can aid to rank and select the type of concrete based on
   sustainability criteria including CO2 emissions, embodied energy, and
   cost using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. One-Click LCA tool
   has been used for the recognition of the distinctions in the LCA results
   by adopting different environmental product declaration databases. HBERT
   is used as a verification tool for One-Click LCA results. A comparative
   study is applied to a multi-story car park concrete structure using both
   traditional concrete and green concrete that includes supplementary
   waste materials. Three different models of concrete that have the same
   compressive strength are selected: traditional concrete, green concrete
   using 30\% fly ash, and green concrete using 50\% ground granulated
   blast-furnace slag (GGBFS). The results showed that using 50\% GGBFS in
   the concrete mix is the most sustainable alternative in terms of CO2
   emissions and embodied energy. Finally, it is concluded that using
   BIM-LCA-AHP integrated approach can help engineers to design
   computerized models that improve the sustainability of construction by
   evaluation based on sustainable objectives.},

Title = {A comprehensive framework for assessing the life-cycle energy of
   building construction assemblies},
Journal = {ARCHITECTURAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building environmental design typically focuses on improvements to
   operational efficiencies such as building thermal performance and system
   efficiency. Often the impacts occuring across the other stages of a
   building's life are not considered or are seen as insignificant in
   comparison. However, previous research shows that embodied impacts can
   be just as important. There is limited consistent and comprehensive
   information available for building designers to make informed decisions
   in this area. Often the information that is available is from disparate
   sources, which makes comparison of alternative solutions unreliable. It
   is also important to ensure that strategies to reduce environmental
   impacts from one cycle stage do not come at the expense of an increase
   in overall life-cycle impacts. A consistent and comprehensive framework
   for assessing and specifying building assemblies for enhanced
   environmental outcomes does not currently exist. This article presents
   the initial findings of a project that aims to establish a database of
   life cycle energy requirements for a broad range of construction
   assemblies, based on a comprehensive assessment framework. Life cycle
   energy requirements have been calculated for eight residential
   construction assemblies integrating an innovative embodied energy
   assessment technique with thermal performance modelling and ranked
   according to their performance.},

Abstract = {The rapid and continuous rise in the energy costs dictates significant
   cost control efforts during buildings' operation phase, despite the fact
   that achieving remarkable energy cost reductions are highly governed by
   the decisions taken during earlier phases of the construction project.
   As a solution, researches attempt to present workflows that include Life
   Cycle Costs (LCC) techniques in the evaluation of building assemblies.
   Some managed to integrate it with Building Information Modelling (BIM),
   while others focused on including the operating energy costs in the
   evaluation without the BIM integration. This paper aims to propose a
   more structured method that both combines the capabilities of BIM and
   energy simulations with the LCC can be developed employing the available
   efforts made. A case study is used to apply the proposed method, and the
   results show that around 17\% LCC savings can be achieved when including
   the energy costs in roof assemblies. The proposed method can be used by
   facility managers or building design team to select the most
   cost-effective building envelope assembly.},

Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction industry involves
   multiple disciplines and activities throughout the building life cycle
   stages (BLS). To enable collaboration amongst these disciplines
   iterative and coordinated exchange of information is required. This
   improves the design process over multiple BLS. Since the last decade,
   BIM is a well-known approach to achieve collaboration through semantic
   representation and exchange of domain data. Despite the improvement,
   there is a lack of efficient implementation and management of building
   life cycle functionalities in existing BIM solutions, because of their
   fundamental heterogeneity, complexity, and adaptability. This research
   focuses on these issues and addresses a clear perception through
   analysis of BLS from various standards and norms. The paper concentrates
   on the demonstration of efficient representation of various BLS through
   the ontological approach and their effective involvement in BIM data
   management. With the validation and evaluation through SPARQL queries,
   this paper presents an ontological framework for building life cycle
   data management.},

Abstract = {A surge in energy demand driven by the growing number of buildings and
   insufficient attention to sustainable and optimised energy-saving
   procedures are likely to threaten the economy and the environment. The
   building envelope is a significant component that influences energy
   requirements, directly affecting the operations costs. Thus, the current
   study considers the envelope to optimise the building's Life Cycle
   Costing (LCC) and enhance energy efficiency. Therefore, to achieve the
   aim of the study, Building Information Modelling (BIM) with the
   integration of Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is adopted to assess the
   building envelope and optimise energy use and relevant costs. Three
   alternatives of wall system: brick wall with rockwool insulation, brick
   wall with polystyrene insulation and curtain walls system, are
   considered for the building envelope to enhance energy-saving potential
   by analysing and comparing the energy demand. To determine LCCA, the Net
   Present Value (NPV) approach was adopted for the initial expenditure and
   the associated future costs. It was found that utilising insulation
   material with low thermal conductivity reduces heating and cooling
   energy resulting optimised LCC. Compared to curtain walls, the results
   show that the rockwool insulated wall reduces 17\% of energy demand
   while the polystyrene wall reduces 12.7\% of the energy. Similarly,
   rockwool insulated walls save 5\% energy relative to the wall system
   with polystyrene insulation. Thus, integrating LCCA with the BIM
   approach at the conceptual design stages promotes energy and LCC
   optimisation.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of modern techniques and industrialized materials has
   resulted in environmental contamination. Therefore, prioritizing the use
   of sustainable materials with minimal CO2 emissions should be the
   fundamental principle guiding future developments in construction
   projects. Rammed earth construction, a traditional method in Latin
   America, is valued for its sustainable, environmentally friendly
   properties. The research examines integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in Colombia, a region
   with limited exploration of BIM-LCA interoperability on earth-based
   materials. This study applies LCA (Cradle-toGate) to assess material
   use, and transportation, aiming to reduce construction carbon emissions.
   This study compares the traditional and Sustainable building
   environmental impacts through the BIM (using Autodesk Revit) and carbon
   footpring. Findings show that BIM-based models with traditional
   materials have significantly higher carbon footprints (171.93 kg CO2 eq
   per square meter) than sustainable models (62.25 kg CO2 eq per square
   meter). This research highlights the importance of low carbon materials
   for the carbon reduction to meet net zero target in construction

Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to explore the opportunities of integrating internet of
   things (IoT) with building information modelling (BIM) to support the
   digital transformation of facilities management (FM). In this regard, a
   conceptual framework is proposed to implement IoT-BIM-based smart FM in
   buildings.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A semi-systematic literature review was conducted to examine the
   opportunities of integrating IoT-BIM-based smart FM.
   Findings
   BIM models are seldom used during the operations stage, and the
   comprehensive digital information developed during the design and
   construction stage is not efficiently used throughout the building's
   life cycle. Therefore, this paper suggests that IoT-BIM can be
   effectively integrated into six FM functions, namely, energy management,
   operations and maintenance management, space management, FM project
   management, emergency management and quality management. IoT-BIM
   provides a beneficial platform for the digital transformation in FM,
   optimising the effectiveness and efficiency of buildings.
   Originality/value
   As a recent approach, the integration of BIM with IoT has created a new
   direction for moving from traditional FM to digitalise smart FM.
   However, the adaptation of IoT-BIM concept, particularly for FM, is yet
   to be explored. Hence, this paper contributes to the IoT-BIM research in
   the FM domain by highlighting six IoT-BIM-based smart FM for digital
   transformation in FM.},

Abstract = {The assessment of the degree of sustainability (environmental, social
   and economic) of real estate assets became possible through the
   development of standards and certification schemes. Clear defined
   criteria and indicators enable sustainability assessments to be made.
   Parametric 3D-building models provide the ideal starting point for
   analysis of buildings in terms of their sustainability with respect to
   many different aspects which can influence a buildings sustainability:
   energy consumption, operating efficiency, environmentally friendly
   building materials, flexibility of use, life cycle costs. This paper
   presents the results and challenges of a pre-project in the form of a
   tested workflow of a smart BIM-based rating system using an example from
   the Swiss Standard for Sustainable Building Switzerland (SNBS) and the
   international DGNB (Adapted for Switzerland) systems. Furthermore, a
   concept for a generic assessment platform is outlined which is able to
   convert the results of a parametric 3Dbuilding model for use by the
   desired label and thus to attain the respective certification with much
   less effort.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for green retrofitting
   is a recent development due to its integrated solutions for evaluating
   and monitoring the environmental sustainability performance of existing
   buildings. It can be implemented throughout different stages of building
   life cycle using centralized digital models. However, the actual
   applications of such technology are still scarce and require further
   study and verification. In this paper, a systematic review of the recent
   development of BIM was conducted on two related areas: (a) existing
   buildings' sustainability performance and (b) green retrofitting. The
   review highlights that little work has been conducted on these two areas
   concurrently which is mainly at the exploration stage. The results
   further reveal common BIM sustainability tools, performance parameters
   and design parameters in the recent research on the green retrofitting
   of existing buildings. Furthermore, a research framework has been
   developed to fill the research gaps and future needs in the
   implementation of BIM for green retrofitting, including data acquisition
   techniques, integrated process, unified platform, data interoperability
   and management, level of automation, design alteration as well as auto
   data feedback. This paper provides new insights into both theoretical
   developments and practical or technical aspects of BIM in fostering a
   complete green retrofit ecosystem.},

   boundary, the credibility of the eco-label information may not be
   satisfactory because recent studies show that the use and end-of-life
   phases can have a significant impact on the life cycle GHG emissions of
   concrete in terms of carbonation, maintenance and rehabilitation, other
   indirect emissions, and recycling activities. A comprehensive review on
   the life cycle assessment of concrete is presented to holistically
   examine the importance of use and end-of-life phases to the life cycle
   GHG quantification of concrete. The recent published 15014067: Carbon
   footprint of products - requirements and guidelines for quantification
   and communication also mandates the use of cradle-to-grave to provide
   publicly available eco-label information when the use and end-of-life
   phases of concrete can be appropriately simulated. With the support of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other simulation technologies,
   the contribution of use and end-of-life phases to the life cycle GHG
   emissions of concrete should not be overlooked in future studies. (C)

Title = {BIM in green building: Enhancing sustainability in the small
   construction project},
Journal = {CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The growing importance of green building practices in addressing
   environmental concerns, with a focus on energy efficiency, resource
   conservation, and occupant well-being, necessitates innovative
   solutions. Building Information Modeling (BIM), a sophisticated digital
   platform facilitating real-time collaboration and construction process
   visualization, emerges as a promising tool to enhance efficiency in
   construction projects. This study explores the role of BIM in advancing
   sustainability in smaller-scale construction projects. The methodology
   encompasses a comprehensive literature review and a quantitative
   analysis, including Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Structural
   Equation Modeling (SEM), with a case study centered in Perak, Malaysia.
   The research aims to assess the impact of BIM on resource efficiency,
   energy performance, waste reduction, and collaborative decision-making
   in small-scale green buildings. The findings reveal significant positive
   correlations between BIM adoption and early-stage design optimization,
   energy efficiency analysis, material selection, life cycle assessment,
   waste reduction, and prefabrication. This study underscores the vital
   role of integrating BIM in smaller-scale construction to promote
   environmentally responsible practices and achieve sustainable outcomes.
   Future research avenues may explore strategies for optimized BIM
   integration and deeper insights into the financial aspects of BIM
   adoption.},

   solutions for office stock},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The European Green Deal establishes the need to renovate buildings in an
   energy efficient way, to address climate and environmental challenges.
   The purpose of this study was to devise a model for identifying
   environmental, cost-effective retrofitting measures by assessing their
   energy, economic and environmental impact when they are applied to the
   entire office stock. The methodology builds upon the energy performance
   certificate scheme to identify the life-cycle energy, economic and
   environmental impacts of a set of energy renovation measures for each
   representative office. The results can then be applied to the entire
   office stock. For any real office, a dozen characteristics are entered.
   Then, a user-friendly interface provides information about the expected
   performance of the renovation measures in that case along with the
   representativeness of the results. This methodology was implemented in a
   Spanish case study of 13,701 energy performance certificates. The
   findings showed that the most efficient energy renovation measures are
   heat pump replacement (18.1 \%) and replacement of lamps with LEDs (14.4
   \%). Although the most effective retrofitting solutions depended on the
   evaluation criteria (energy, economic or environmental), 99.5 \% of the
   cost-effective measures also reduced emissions during the life cycle.},

Abstract = {Green building construction has received global interest over the past
   two decades. The definition of a green building has evolved from
   energy-efficient buildings to net-zero buildings, and now is expanding
   towards net-positive buildings. Even though these concepts entail
   significant environmental benefits, they largely overlook life cycle
   environmental impacts associated with building construction. While
   net-zero to net-positive development is expected to result in
   operational environmental benefits, the energy demand reduction and
   renewable energy-related interventions carry added life cycle impacts
   during the construction and demolition stages. Therefore, without taking
   a life cycle thinking perspective to green building assessment, it is
   difficult to quantify the exact environmental benefits. To address this
   issue, this research aims to develop life cycle performance benchmarks
   for green buildings and to provide a mechanism to rate ``green{''}
   buildings based on life cycle environmental performance. A
   methodological framework was developed to evaluate the aggregated life
   cycle performance of green buildings, thus enabling the best choices in
   green building design through a more holistic perspective. The proposed
   framework is deployed by combining life cycle thinking with BIM, which
   can be used to monitor and track building inputs and construction
   practices under various scenarios. Outcomes of this research will
   redefine the concept of green buildings and will lay out the foundation
   for constructing zero impact on civil infrastructure. The findings will
   assist the construction industry, community developers, and government
   authorities to ensure that sustainable development goals are being met
   in a true and holistic sense.},

   ``WG\#03: BIM \& Realization{''}, which is the part of the Czech BIM
   Council, especially the document called ``Draft of unified data
   structure for Building Information Modeling in the Czech Republic{''}.
   The findings of this paper are in the defining specific Level of
   Development of relative parameters, mentioned in this document,
   connected to the specific level of information and details requested by
   the Czech Republic's Legislation. These findings could be used as an
   underlay to create document called ``Level of Development draft
   assignment to the individual stages of project documentation in the
   Czech Republic{''}. The Level of Development is the most useful way of
   the information visualization, which leads to the most effortless way of
   exact stated implementation of Building Information Modeling into the
   practice of designing structures and buildings in the Czech Republic.
   The Implementation of using Building Information Modeling technology in
   designing structures and buildings will lead to the enhanced quality of
   the project documentation and generally to more effective cost savings
   during whole life cycle of buildings. Moreover, the all over using of
   the BIM technology in the Czech Republic will be very useful in the
   Facility Management area, especially in the facility management and
   maintenance of state buildings.},

Abstract = {The Building Information Model (BIM) has become a key tool to achieve
   communication during the whole building life-cycle. Open standards, such
   as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its
   adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain
   information integration and query. To address these challenges, the
   Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and
   Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and
   interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based
   extension of such semantic BIMs that provides support for imprecise
   knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy
   ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a
   BIM context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic BIM
   enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages
   namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible BIM query,
   and imprecise parametric modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) software is a powerful

   presents a first proof of concept of a conversion tool targeting the
   TRNSYS simulation environment. The tool is capable of automatically
   extract information from a building model, specified according to the
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) open standard, and consistently
   creates the required BEPS input files. Data requirements for the
   IFC-to-TRN-SYS interoperability are commented, and finally, the tool is
   demonstrated through a case study running a yearly thermal load
   calculation for a simple test building. This contributes to put the
   TRNSYS modelling potential at disposal of the AEC industry and opens up
   to very promising research challenges.},

   Component Reuse},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {While the Circular Economy in the built environment is often viewed in
   terms of recycling, more value can be obtained from buildings and
   physical components by their reuse, aided by stewardship and
   remanufacture, to ensure optimum performance capability. The use of
   cyber-physical information for online identification, examination and
   exchange of reusable components may improve their life-cycle management
   and circularity. To this end, a bi-directional data exchange system is
   established between physical building components and their virtual
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) counterparts, so that their
   life-cycle information-including history of ownership, maintenance
   record, technical specifications and physical condition-can be tracked,
   monitored and managed. The resultant prototype Cloud-based BIM platform
   is then adapted to support an ongoing product-service relationship
   between suppliers/providers and users/clients. A case study from a major
   new hospital, focusing upon an example of internal framed glazed
   systems, is presented for ``proof of concept{''} and to demonstrate the
   application of the proposed method. The result of the case study shows
   that, informed by the life-cycle data from the Cloud-BIM platform, a
   ``lease with reuse{''} service option is able to deliver a lower total
   cost and less carbon intensity for each unit of frame-glazed module.
   This leads to a higher level of eco-efficiency, coupled with decreased
   consumption of material resources and reduced generation of waste. The
   research is expected to serve as a step forward in the era of Industry
   4.0 and illuminate a more sophisticated way to manage building assets.},

Title = {The life cycle assessment of a UK data centre},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {332-349},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Data centres are high-energy consumers, and historical assessment of
   their environmental impact has focused largely on energy consumption.
   Widely adopted assessment methods consider either single issues or do
   not comprehensively assess links between issues. One exception is the
   CLEER Model, which compares life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of Cloud-based and present-day services. However, there
   remains the need to verify components for inclusion in a data centre
   life cycle assessment (LCA), assess quality and quantity of secondary
   data, benchmark an existing data centre LCA, assess non-Cloud-based
   services for multiple impacts, and establish facility areas that are
   sensitive to change.
   A hybrid approach, combining process-based and economic input output
   (EIO) data, was used to perform the screening LCA of an existing UK data
   centre. The study includes the definition of the goal and scope,
   modelling assumptions, a life cycle inventory, results and
   interpretation and a sensitivity check.
   The dominance of the information technology (IT) operational phase to
   the overall impact and the severity of the impact on human health are
   concluded. Due to the use of free cooling, the IT-embodied impact is
   greater than the combined mechanical and electrical operational impact.
   Electricity production dominates the total life cycle impact; however,
   the second most significant impact derives from the disposal of metal
   refining waste products during the manufacture of IT components and
   electricity distribution networks. The release of carcinogens is one of
   the largest contributors to the whole life cycle impact and is almost
   equal in value between the embodied and operational phases. Finally, a
   sensitivity check found that a Swedish facility optimised for
   operational energy efficiency with a 1.25-year server refresh resulted
   in an embodied impact almost double the operational.
   It was concluded that current LCI data, software packages and project
   data allow for a sufficiently accurate data centre LCA model. The
   results support the need to broaden environmental impact reduction to
   beyond operational energy consumption for cooling and that building
   environmental assessment methods (BEAMs) should consider more embodied
   impacts. It is concluded also that three parameters are sensitive to
   design changes that influence the overall impact: operational energy for
   the IT equipment, cooling and power delivery; the energy mix; and the
   amount of IT equipment across the facility's lifetime. The results
   present a clear need to monitor life cycle impact, develop further tools
   to compare different design/operation options and functional units,
   improve data and develop an LCA-based BEAM.},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of building stock have received significant
   attention as buildings release one-third of the total greenhouse gas
   emissions. Whole-building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has become a
   trend to address this limitation by ensuring the best environmental
   performance of a building. However, the current WBLCA development faces
   many challenges, which makes it difficult to create reliable and
   comparable results. This study aims to conduct a critical literature
   review to summarize the current challenges in WBLCA applications and the
   emerging approaches that might address these challenges. Three main
   challenges are listed: variances in goal and scope definition, building
   structure complexity, and varieties in the LCA database and methods.
   Emerging approaches are also presented to address these challenges,
   including the integration of building information modeling into WBLCA
   and environmental product declaration applications in impact
   assessments. The findings of this study could support researchers and
   decision-makers with the most popular approaches to conduct WBLCA and
   achieve reliable outputs.},

Abstract = {Environmental assessment is a critical activity for ensuring buildings
   are performing according to specified requirements, and efficient,
   seamless exchange of building information is crucial for environmental
   assessment. Therefore, all those involved in built environment issues
   should be able to access and share not only building information but
   also data about products, especially environmental assessment results
   for the products used in building projects. Of the several approaches
   that have been proposed to achieve efficient information exchange,
   semantic web technologies are amongst the most promising due to their
   capability to share data and enhance interoperability between the most
   heterogeneous systems. This study proposes an approach that can be used
   to make environmental data available in the early phases of the building
   lifecycle. It relies on Semantic Web techniques, especially Linked Data
   principles, while building on emerging Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) technology to propose an approach that facilitates information
   exchange to enhance the sustainability assessment of buildings. The
   paper ends with an illustration of how lifecycle inventory databases can
   be integrated, linked to BIM software and used in exchanging

Abstract = {Traditional safety planning methods that rely on manual inspections
   result in labour-intensive, time-consuming, and inadequate information
   transmission, which has significant negative social and economic effects
   on our society, as well as financial and schedule losses for
   construction projects. Building information modelling (BIM) is useful
   for analysing workplace safety issues, preventing risks and hazards, and
   improving safety throughout the project's life cycle. This study intends
   to pinpoint health and safety concerns and to understand the role of BIM
   adoption in enhancing health and safety in Malaysian building
   construction projects. Following a survey of 302 Malaysian construction
   industry professionals, statistical data analysis using the relative
   importance index, reliability, validity, and correlation measures was
   performed. The results show that implementing BIM can prevent accidents
   on construction sites by detecting physical spatial clashes,
   anticipating project dangers, and providing a wealth of parametric data
   throughout the entire life cycle of structures. A framework was created
   to improve the application of BIM to enhance health and safety linked
   with construction projects. The study found that construction industry
   stakeholders believe that BIM implementation in construction projects
   can improve health and safety and reduce accident rates in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Relatively little information exists about the use of BIM in the
   operation and maintenance of buildings. Reported cases of BIM adoption
   to support facilities management and lifecycle management reveals that
   the implementation of BIM for FM processes is, in general, limited to an
   experimental scale. Even large public owners who have been using BIM for
   managing their construction projects have not implemented it into their
   FM activities. Therefore, there is little evidence of the benefits of
   BIM in the operational phase. In addition, the challenges involved in
   shifting from traditional FM processes to new BIM-based processes are
   not well known. In this paper we document some of the issues involved in
   the adoption of BIM in FM and identify some applications, metrics and
   benefits related to its adoption. The findings are based on a case study
   carried out within a major re-development project in Manchester, UK.
   Results indicate a step rise in the level of awareness regarding
   potential benefits of BIM in FM activities and lifecycle information
   management.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been facing a paradigm shift to (i)
   increase; productivity, efficiency, infrastructure value, quality and
   sustainability, (ii) reduce; lifecycle costs, lead times and
   duplications, via effective collaboration and communication of
   stakeholders in construction projects. Digital construction is a
   political initiative to address low productivity in the sector. This
   seeks to integrate processes throughout the entire lifecycle by
   utilising Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. The focus is to
   create and reuse consistent digital information by the stakeholders
   throughout the lifecycle. However, implementation and use of BIM systems
   requires dramatic changes in the current business practices, bring new
   challenges for stakeholders e.g., the emerging knowledge and skill gap.
   This paper reviews and discusses the status of implementation of the BIM
   systems around the globe and their implications to the industry.
   Moreover, based on the lessons learnt, it will provide a guide to tackle
   these challenges and to facilitate successful transition towards
   utilizing BIM systems in construction projects.},

Title = {Environmental Impact Assessment of Construction Waste Recycling versus
   Disposal Scenarios Using an LCA-BIM Tool during the Design Stage},
Journal = {RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The scientific community has revealed the environmental benefits of
   recycling construction waste (CW) versus its disposal, and its
   contribution to circularity. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method
   enables the environmental impact of CW management to be quantified and
   facilitates the comparison of recycling versus alternative disposal
   scenarios. However, due to its complexity, LCA is seldom used by
   technicians during the design phase, which constitutes a crucial stage
   in the prevention of environmental impacts. This paper therefore
   proposes an LCA-based tool, integrated into the Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) methodology, that helps designers to automate the
   environmental assessment of recycling versus disposal. The CW-LCA-BIM
   tool uses impact factors obtained from an LCA model applied to CW and
   was applied to the structural system of a building in Spain. Up to 99\%
   of the non-hazardous waste was recyclable or reusable. The management of
   three types of recyclable waste was assessed: concrete (27.2 t),
   plastics (4.2 t), and steel (1.5 t). Recycling is shown to be the best
   option since it prevents 1.4 times (14.6 t) the emissions of the
   disposal scenario and saves 85 times (148.5 GJ) its energy consumption.
   This tool can be developed in other waste management systems and
   infrastructures. It can be useful both for designers for the reduction
   of the environmental impact of their buildings, and for policy managers
   for waste-prevention policies.},

Abstract = {The major environmental and economic burdens occurring from the
   high-energy consumption of buildings led to energy performance being a
   critical aspect for green building rating systems. Building energy codes
   play an important role for such performances through establishing the
   baseline requirements to meet the rating system needs. Building
   information modeling (BIM) was used to model a concrete masonry unit
   (CMU) block wall with various insulation thicknesses assigned various
   insulation layer thicknesses depending on the insulation material
   property. Multiple scenarios were created in compliance with several
   energy codes and its different versions. The scenarios modeled were then
   analyzed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calibrate environmental
   performance of different energy codes used as baseline codes for
   different green building rating systems. The results indicate the
   differences between the various green building rating systems according
   to respective energy baseline codes and their versions adopted.
   Tendencies towards more efficient with less environmentally harmful
   buildings were observed. Comparing the different codes with the direct
   impact on the green building rating systems shows that rapid development
   in energy codes surpassed the impact resulted from adopting the green
   building rating systems. The amount of reduction in environmental impact
   was significantly and tangible due to change in the energy code. (C)

Title = {Application of semantic Web ontologies for the improvement of
   information exchange in existing buildings},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {444-464},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Purpose Facilitating the information exchange and interoperability
   between stakeholders during the life-cycle of an asset can be one of the
   fundamental necessities for developing an enhanced information exchange
   framework. Such a framework can also improve the successful
   accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web
   technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing
   building projects. Design/methodology/approach In real-world building
   projects, the construction industry's information supply chain may
   initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started
   resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data
   sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data
   generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and
   processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase.
   Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies
   can address some of the challenges and limitations of information
   exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the
   use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the
   challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies.
   Findings The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines
   the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched
   3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on
   facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing
   buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology
   Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and
   improve the proposed framework. Originality/value The proposed framework
   is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource
   Description Framework data produced by the previously developed
   framework. The proposed approach makes a valuable contribution to the
   asset/facilities management (AM/FM) domain. It should be of interest to
   various FM practices for existing assets, such as the building
   information/knowledge management for design, construction and O\&M
   stages of an asset's life-cycle.},

Title = {Exploring Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things
   (IoT) Integration for Sustainable Building},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sustainable development, which has become the priority study of
   architectural design, is receiving increasing attention with global
   climate change. At the same time, the building industry is urgently
   changing towards intelligent and digitalized tendencies. As a result,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Internet of Things (IoT)
   make crucial contributions to the transforming process. However, there
   is little knowledge of the integration of BIM-IoT in sustainable
   building from a macro perspective. Moreover, most existing research
   adopts a literature review method and lacks objective quantitative
   analysis. Few papers use bibliometric analysis to study the respective
   BIM and IoT research fields. Furthermore, few studies use Citespace
   software tools to analyze the integrated application of BIM-IoT.
   Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the research frontiers and
   knowledge structure in BIM-IoT integration and the relationship between
   BIM-IoT and sustainable building and explore the research hotspots,
   trends, and future research directions. A quick and objective method was
   proposed to understand the research status of these new and rapidly
   developing fields. This paper uses topic search in the web of science
   core collection to obtain relevant literature and then uses Citespace
   for bibliometric analysis based on the literature review. Controlled
   terms and subject terms statistics from the Engineering Index core
   database search results are also used to briefly examine the fields'
   research frontiers and hotspots as obtained from Citespace. The results
   show that: (1) The research on BIM-IoT integration focuses on building
   intelligence with BIM as the basis of application, and research on
   BIM-IoT integration within the field of sustainable building is
   currently focused on the first three phases of the life cycle. (2) The
   development of sustainable buildings needs to be considered on its human
   and social dimensions. BIM provides a platform for sharing information
   and communication among stakeholders involved in the building's entire
   life cycle. At the same time, IoT allows occupants to better participate
   in buildings' sustainable design and decision making. (3) In the future,
   more emerging technologies such as cloud computing and big data are
   required to better promote sustainable buildings and thus realize the
   construction of sustainable smart cities. At the same time, researchers
   should also pay attention to the sustainable transformation of existing
   buildings.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Numerous qualitative review studies have been conducted to enhance the
   understanding of current research status of green buildings (GBs). Green
   building assessment methods (GBAMs) are crucial to the development of
   GBs and relevant research works has received wide attention. However,
   there are very few reviews to quantitively explore these studies.
   Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review literatures on
   GBAMs, and visually analyzes them through CiteSpace and HistCite. The
   article identified the most influential journals, contributors,
   representative institutions and regions. The knowledge bases of this
   area focus on ``triple bottom line{''}, ``indicator{''}, ``building
   design{''}, ``life cycle costing{''}, ``life cycle sustainability
   assessment{''}, ``tropical climate{''}, ``building information
   modelling{''} and ``Chinese green building label{''}. Through citation
   analysis, ``updating existing GBAMs by scheme comparison{''}, ``updating
   existing GBAMs by GB case analysis{''}, ``establishment of new GBAMs{''}
   and ``incorporation of BIM in GBAMs{''} were found as the main research
   themes. ``Design{''}, ``LCA{''}, ``model{''}, ``energy{''},
   ``management{''}, ``residential buildings{''} and ``office buildings{''}
   are high -frequency keywords. Future research directions were finally
   proposed as ``more investigation on the other types of GBs{''},
   ``incorporation of cost -related criteria{''}, ``enhancing health
   -related indicators{''} and ``integrating with BIM technology{''}. The
   results could provide a useful reference to industry practitioners and

Title = {Whole building life cycle assessment for buildings: A case study ON HOW
   to achieve the LEED credit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {297},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Whole building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has received significant
   attention from the research community in the past few years. The United
   States Green Building Council (USGBC) has made it an option for
   receiving points in version 4 of its Leadership in Energy and
   Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Yet, the research described
   in this paper has revealed that the process of WBLCA as applied to LEED
   is not very well understood by building professionals. As many building
   professionals do not understand WBLCA, very few pursue it for their new
   building projects. The objective of the research described in this paper
   was to examine and clarify issues related to WBLCA as it applies to
   LEED. The paper presents a six-step process for conducting a WBLCA and
   use the process on a building case study for which a LEED compliant
   WBLCA was conducted and approved. The paper also suggests improvements
   to the current LEED WBLCA requirements that have the potential to
   further reduce the embodied energy and environmental impacts of
   materials used in new building projects. The ultimate goal of the
   research presented in the paper is to increase the building industry
   awareness of the WBLCA process and make it ``business as usual{''}. (C)

Abstract = {Early and precise decisions can help the process of sustainable design
   to become much more efficient and cost-effective. Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) enables a scientific assessment, which facilitates locating
   possible changes associated with different stages of the cycle which
   results in improvements in its environmental profile. Although LCA is
   increasingly present in the demands of the building sector,
   professionals continue to seek new ways to incorporate such a
   methodology into the building design and construction processes as
   seamlessly and straightforwardly as possible. A promising possibility is
   the integration of building components LCA data in the Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) platform. This paper discusses the
   consequences of the simplifications of LCA data and methodology in the
   main existing tools that integrates LCA in the BIM platform using a
   simulation on wall systems performed in a BIM plug-in. The consistency
   of the results is compared to a full WA on Gabi 6 software. The results
   were not consistent, despite the research efforts towards equalizing the
   scope of the studies to provide a fair comparison. The reasons are
   probably the simplifications and shortcuts necessary for developing a
   simpler BIM-based tool to be applied during the design process, by any
   building designer with no particular expertise in LCA.},

Abstract = {A sustainable building is constructed of materials that could decrease
   environmental impacts, such as energy usage, during the lifecycle of the
   building. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been identified as an
   effective tool for building performance analysis virtually in the design

   of materials using BIM and identify alternative, sustainable solutions
   to reduce operational energy consumption. The amount of energy consumed
   by a double story bungalow house in Johor, Malaysia, and assessments of
   alternative material configurations to determine the best energy
   performance were evaluated by using Revit Architecture 2012 and Autodesk
   Ecotect Analysis software to show which of the materials helped in
   reducing the operational energy use of the building to the greatest
   extent throughout its annual life cycle. At the end, some alternative,
   sustainable designs in terms of energy savings have been suggested. (C)

Title = {Framework for construction system selection based on life cycle cost and
   sustainability assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {241},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a framework for the selection
   of construction systems of low and medium rise buildings used in
   residential, office and commercial applications. The construction
   systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural
   steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is
   developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle
   analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making
   in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from
   cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage,
   use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse
   options. The developed framework integrates building information
   modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to
   calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of
   construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to
   their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties
   in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability
   distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to
   investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result.
   Application of the developed system to a university building revealed
   the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for
   RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of
   SS framing system is 13.4\% more. When the system is credited for
   possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse,
   the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing
   system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS
   framing system becomes 22\% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results
   shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean
   cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The
   sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points
   associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste
   management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {BIM can help decarbonize the construction sector: Primary life cycle
   evidence from pavement management systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {391},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Transforming the construction sector is key to reaching net-zero, and
   many stakeholders expect its decarbon-ization through digitalization,
   but no quantified evidence has been brought to date. This article
   proposes the first environmental quantification of the impact of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction sector.
   Specifically, the direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road maintenance - a Pavement
   Management System (PMS) -are evaluated using field data from France. The
   related carbon footprints are calculated following a life cycle
   approach, using different sources of data - including ecoinvent v3.6 -
   and the IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three
   design-build-maintain pavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1
   relates to a massive design and surface maintenance, scenario 2 to a
   progressive design and pre-planned structural maintenance, and scenario
   3 to a progressive design and tailored structural maintenance supported
   by the PMS. First, results show the negligible direct emissions due to
   the PMS existence - 0.02\% of the life cycle emissions of scenario 3's
   pavement, e.g. 0.52 t CO2eq for 10 km and 30 years. Second, the base
   case and two complementary sensitivity analyses show that the use of a
   PMS is climate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade
   bearing capacity improves over time, neutral for the climate otherwise.
   The GHG emissions savings using BIM can reach up to 14 and 30\% of the
   life cycle emissions respectively compared to scenario 2 and 1, and
   resp. 47 and 65\% when restraining the scope to maintenance and
   rehabilitation and excluding original pavement construction. Third, the
   neutral effect of BIM in case of a dete-rioration of the bearing
   capacity of the subgrade may be explained by design practices and safety
   margins, that could in fact be enhanced using BIM. Fourth, the
   decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is discussed, and
   research perspectives are presented.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Governments in developing countries serve low income people by
   constructing low income housing projects. Most of total life cycle cost
   (LCC) of these projects is incurred during the operational phase, making
   these projects lose their economic aspect of sustainability. Decreasing
   the cost of low income housing projects and taking into consideration
   the available resources are two crucial facets that should be taken into
   consideration. Therefore, this paper focuses on two aspects of the
   sustainability of building through its life cycle, which are
   environmental and economic aspects using environmentally friendly
   materials in construction. To accomplish this aim, a framework is
   developed that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with
   computer simulation, optimization and system dynamics in Low Income
   Housing (LIH) projects. The developed framework helps in determining LIH
   project duration and selecting the optimum alternative with to material
   systems. The sustainability aspects of building are achieved by
   considering a LCC of these buildings and the number of points that can
   be awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design(LEED)
   rating system. It aids government and/or contractors in adopting BIM
   technology to minimize life cycle cost while achieving maximum LEED
   materials credits points for LIH projects. Social Housing project in
   Bach City-Egypt is considered as a case study to demonstrate the use of
   the developed prototype and to illustrate its essential features. The
   results have shown that selection of sustainable building materials for
   the construction has a crucial role in the formation of a sustainable
   building as they affect the performance of building. Therefore, the
   Egyptian government should consider building materials with sustainable
   properties and a low LCC in the design phase to mitigate the negative
   impacts of LIH projects.},

Abstract = {The architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has
   explored various methods to lower project costs while improving quality
   and productivity. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Scrum have
   demonstrated a high potential in assisting in achieving these
   objectives. BIM technology is essential as a technical container for the
   information model of a building project and as a new construction
   strategy that amalgamates other benefits outlined in the existing
   literature. This study examined the commonalities between Agile Scrum
   (AS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) and explored the
   possibility of integrating BIM into the Agile Scrum framework, called
   BIM-Scrum. BIM Scrum was formed by extracting core similarities between
   the study of BIM and Scrum. The design phase of the BIM project life
   cycle and its relevant components are extracted from CIDB Guide 5 for
   integration with Scrum. The ``Collaboration Production of
   Information{''} phase and its relevant BIM components (Employer's
   Information Requirement (EIR), BIM Execution Plan (BEP), Task
   Information Delivery Plan (TIDP), Master Information Delivery Plan
   (MIDP) are extracted from the BIM life cycle to be synthesised with
   Scrum. Specific adjustments and refinements are recommended to allow BIM
   adaptation into Scrum during the adaptation process. Several interviews
   were conducted as part of the outcome review procedure, and content
   analysis was used to identify, characterise, and understand the
   interview data. The benefits of BIM-Scrum were identified, and adoption
   strategies were examined throughout the process. Finally, the BIM-Scrum
   framework was developed as a reference model for the Malaysian
   construction industry at the end of the research.},

Abstract = {BIM (Building Information Modelling) technological push has enabled to
   integrate the design/construction outcomes of 3D-CAD along the
   product/service AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) SC
   (supply chain) through an intelligent DMS (Data Management System) based
   on standard and interoperable data formats. The proposed end-to-end
   approach overcomes a typical AEC gap, enables the operationalisation of
   the sustainable/green building LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and puts
   together new collaborative relationships with the owner, among SC
   stakeholders and with new forms of BIM procurement. The outlined
   collaborative business model is based on the Quality Control and
   Assurance framework and provides conceptual consistency to the
   reintroduction of the owner concerns/satisfaction in the SC, as well as
   enables consistent and accountable relationships between
   (smart)materials procurement and building specification. An expert's
   focus group carried out a preliminary check of the model's
   interest/applicability, resulting in recommendations for its further
   detailing and for propositions development into a systematic enquiring
   process.},

Title = {An integrated BIM-based framework for minimizing embodied energy during
   building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {592-604},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Assessment of the embodied energy associated with the production and
   transportation of materials during the design phase of building provides
   great potential to profoundly affect the building's energy use and
   sustainability performance. While Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   gives opportunities to incorporate sustainability performance indicators
   in the building design process, it lacks interoperability with the
   conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools used to analyse the
   environmental footprints of materials in building design. Additionally,
   many LCA tools use databases based on industry-average values and thus
   cannot account for differences in the embodied impacts of specific
   materials from individual suppliers. To address these issues, this paper
   presents a framework that supports design decisions and enables
   assessment of the embodied energy associated with building materials
   supply chain based on suppliers' Environmental Product Declarations
   (EPDs). The framework also integrates Extract Transform Load (ETL)
   technology into the BIM to ensure BIM-LCA interoperability, enabling an
   automated or semi-automated assessment process. The applicability of the
   framework is tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case
   study, which shows that a building's energy use and carbon footprint can
   be significantly reduced during the design phase by accounting the
   impact of individual material in the supply chain. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Adopting Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the Development of
   Smart Buildings: A Review of Enabling Applications and Challenges},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {The construction industry is undergoing a digital revolution due to the
   emergence of new technologies. A significant trend is that construction
   projects have been transformed and upgraded to the digital and smart
   mode in the whole life cycle. As a critical technology for the
   construction industry's innovative development, building information
   modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in building design, construction, and
   operation. BIM has gained much interest in the research field of smart
   buildings in recent years. However, the dimensions of BIM and smart
   building applications have not been explored thoroughly so far. With an
   in-depth review of related journal articles published from 1996 to July
   2020 on the BIM applications for smart buildings, this paper provides a
   comprehensive understanding and critical thinking about the nexus of BIM
   and smart buildings. This paper proposes a framework with three
   dimensions for the nexus of BIM application in smart buildings,
   including BIM attributes, project phases, and smart attributes.
   According to the three dimensions, this paper elaborates on (1) the
   advantages of BI M for achieving various smartness; (2) applications of
   BIM in multiple phases of smart buildings; and (3) smart building
   functions that be achieved with BIM. Based on the analysis of the
   literature in three dimensions, this paper presents the cross-analysis
   of the nexus of BIM and smart buildings. Lastly, this paper proposes the
   critical insights and implications about the research gaps and research
   trends: (1) enhancing the interoperability of BIM software; (2) further
   exploring the role of BIM in the operation and refurbishment phase of
   smart buildings; (3) paying attention to BIM technology in the field of
   transportation infrastructure; (4) clarifying the economic benefits of
   BIM projects; and (5) integrating BIM and other technologies.},

Title = {Integrated Value Engineering and Life Cycle Cost Modeling for HVAC
   System Selection},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Selecting a suitable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
   system is critical, because it impacts a building's life cycle cost
   (LCC). Several factors affect the selection decision, such as quality,
   buildability, internal and external building appearance, HVAC size and
   weight, and LCC. These criteria are difficult to measure, as they are
   not based on agreed measurement units. Another challenging factor in the
   selection process is assessing the building's function/performance and
   determining its HVAC needs. Currently, the decision depends mostly on
   expert knowledge, and there is no agreed-upon systematic method to
   follow. This paper aims to develop a systematic model for selecting HVAC
   systems based on the value engineering (VE) concept. The model
   identified fourteen criteria based on an agreed standard test for
   objective criteria and a typical evaluation for subjective criteria.
   These HVAC criteria were assessed using a combination of the AHP,
   pairwise, function analysis system (FAST), and Monte Carlo techniques.
   As a result, a complete model was developed to enhance the selection
   process, programmed within the building information modeling (BIM)
   environment platform. Several HVAC experts were interviewed and more
   than twenty expert opinions were collected to validate the model. In
   addition, a case study building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was implemented
   using the programmed HVAC selection model for validation purposes. The
   programmed model can significantly facilitate the selection process for
   designers.},

Title = {Structure Monitoring with BIM and IoT: The Case Study of a Bridge Beam

Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The diffusion of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a reference
   methodology, applied to the world of construction, leads to important
   changes in the design and the management of big constructions and
   infrastructures. However, although the BIM approach is necessary for
   managing the entire life cycle of a construction, today, this
   methodology is still rarely adopted beyond the design phase. This
   represents a major flaw because the management of every phase of the
   life cycle of buildings needs accurate preliminary planning. Certainly,
   one of the most complex and important phases of the life cycle of a
   construction is the monitoring phase, which represents a fundamental
   aspect for the maintenance and the safe fruition of buildings or civil
   constructions. Considering this, the multidisciplinary approach of
   merging BIM methodology with real-time monitoring, using low-cost IoT
   (Internet of Things) sensors, seems to be an interesting topic to
   develop. In this paper, we will propose an example of a connection
   between an IoT system and a BIM model for monitoring the deflection of a
   bridge beam at the centerline using a schematic scale model reproduced
   in the laboratory and modelled in BIM. The developed system allows the
   real-time connection between the real model and its digital twin through
   the use of a relational database management system (RDBMS), to which the
   data detected by the sensor are transmitted, allowing the risk
   assessment of the real structure. This solution gives the possibility to
   remotely monitor, in real time, the behaviour of the structure
   visualised in the BIM model.},

Abstract = {Climate change mitigation requires the construction of low/zero-carbon
   buildings, and this is a challenge for designers. The use of Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) provides useful information to support eco-efficiency
   improvements and therefore, to reduce the climate impacts of building
   designs. However, it does not provide information about whether a
   proposed design aligns with achieving the global climate target of
   limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. This
   study, therefore, introduces an LCA-based top-down approach for setting
   climate targets for the whole life cycle of buildings in terms of
   greenhouse gas emissions. It involves assigning a share of the 2 degrees
   C global carbon budget for 2018-2050 to a country, to the construction
   sector of the country, and finally to a building. The approach includes
   a stock model that accounts for the projected growth in the number of
   buildings and associated climate impacts in a country up to 2050. The
   proposed approach was applied to a detached house in New Zealand, the
   most common residential building type in the country; it was found that
   the climate target of a New Zealand detached house over a 90-year
   lifetime is 71 tCO(2)eq. This modelling approach has potential to guide
   designers and other interested stakeholders in development of building
   designs enabling the building sector to operate within a selected global
   climate target (such as the 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C target).},

Title = {Sustainability-Based Lifecycle Management for Bridge Infrastructure
   Using 6D BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {A number of bridge infrastructures are rising significantly due to
   economic expansion and growing numbers of railway and road
   infrastructures. Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional
   design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction
   processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has
   been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and
   process the integration of information in a shared environment. This
   paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle
   asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a
   case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model
   information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint
   analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this
   paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon
   emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of
   the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment
   to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance.
   This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to
   bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D
   BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and
   reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages
   through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can
   promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied
   for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle
   asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time
   structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among
   working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact are two
   major priorities worldwide. The building construction industry
   represents a considerable share of global energy consumption and carbon
   emission. The majority of information required for sustainability
   evaluation of a building is usually specified at early stages of
   projects. Therefore, decision makers can potentially estimate energy
   consumption and environmental impacts of a building in the preliminary
   design phases in order to attain the best results in terms of
   sustainability. During the past decade, building information modeling
   (BIM) has become widely adopted in the architectural, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry, and the trend is still growing.
   Sustainability evaluation is one of the applications of BIM that can be
   implemented from early stages of building projects. Although, using BIM
   for extraction of information required for sustainability assessment
   shortens the evaluation process, the lack of interoperability between
   BIM and sustainability evaluation software makes the information
   exchange process tedious and error-prone. This paper reviews the current
   status of the application of BIM for sustainability assessments and
   identifies issues and shortcomings. It also investigates potentials of
   BIM standards such as IFC, as BIM's open standard file format, and the
   level of development (LOD) Specification for addressing these
   challenges. Finally, a three-level IFC/LOD-based LCA analysis approach
   is presented, which can enable designers to estimate the embodied energy
   of buildings from early stages of projects, and refines such estimation
   as a design progresses by adding more reliable content to the model.},

Title = {Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Construction within the
   Industrialized Building Process: A Monetization and Building Information
   Modelling Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Industrialization has been widely regarded as a sustainable construction
   method in terms of its environmental friendliness. However, existing
   studies mainly consider the single impact of greenhouse gas emissions or
   material consumption in the construction process of industrialized
   buildings, and pay less attention to ecological pollution and community
   interest, which leads to an insufficient understanding. There is an
   urgent need to systematically carry out accurate assessment of
   comprehensive construction environmental impact within industrialized
   building processes. Various methods, including face-to-face interviews,
   field research and building information modeling (BIM), were used for
   data collection. Four categories selected for the study included
   resource consumption, material loss, ecological pollution, and community
   interest. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model, namely
   input-process-output model (IPO), is proposed to analyze the
   construction environmental impact of the standard layer of
   industrialized buildings from four life cycle stages, namely,
   transportation, stacking, assembly and cast-in-place. The monetization
   approach of willingness to pay (WTP) was applied to make a quantitative
   comparison. Results reveal that the assembly stage has the largest
   impact on the environment at 66.13\% among the four life cycle stages,
   followed by transportation at 16.39\%, stacking at 10.29\%, and
   cast-in-place at 7.19\%. The key factors include power consumption,
   noise pollution, material loss, fuel consumption and component loss,
   which altogether account for more than 85\% of the total impact.
   Relevant stakeholders can conduct their project using the same approach
   to determine the construction environmental performance and hence
   introduce appropriate measures to mitigate the environmental burden.},

Title = {Exterior walls selection framework using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)},
Journal = {COGENT ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The building material selection among different options is a crucial
   issue affected by quality and cost. The implementation of the value
   engineering (VE) process is challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a
   framework for automating the VE process and integrating it with the
   decision-making process for building material selection. Moreover, this
   process becomes easily applicable by using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). This study's research methodology combines VE,
   Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Pairwise, and Function Analysis
   System Technique (FAST) methods to select the best choice of eight
   assemblies of exterior walls based on nine identified criteria.
   Moreover, a questionnaire is used to validate the chosen criteria
   weights. Furthermore, a case study of a commercial building is
   conducted. Eight assemblies of exterior walls are modeled and evaluated
   using the proposed framework. Finally, the results are presented to
   three experts to receive their feedback, and it shows that the proposed
   framework gives a reliable evaluation of the value of each alternative.
   The programmed framework with BIM is a great aid to the decision-maker
   to select the most valuable materials during the design stage. This
   study gives guidance to future studies to standardize the external walls
   alternative to be evaluated more efficiently.},

Title = {Combining life cycle assessment and Building Information Modelling to
   account for carbon emission of building demolition waste: A case study},

Abstract = {Building demolition waste presents a significant challenge due to its
   large scale. Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition,
   collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has
   environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed
   by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
   appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However,
   previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon
   emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the
   treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A
   conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the
   assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building
   demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information
   Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into
   the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential
   building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented
   in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from
   recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to
   another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental
   benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could
   contribute to as high as 45\% of carbon emission reduction despite only
   accounting for 0.66\% of the total weight. Across various lifecycle
   stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to
   the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better
   performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of
   carbon emissions. Furthermore, a large scale inventories are developed
   as an outcome of this case study. These findings provide useful inputs
   to the future endeavor of building demolition waste recycling in a bid
   to reduce the associated carbon emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Energy efficiency assessment of a public building resourcing a BIM model},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {The construction sector high energy consumption and GHG emissions lead
   to the development of easier methodologies to achieve low carbon
   buildings. Currently, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   growing in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation
   (AECO) sector, and it assumes relevance in buildings energy simulation.
   Therefore, this work aims to explore the potential and limitations of
   applying BIM to energy management and simulation in the operation life
   cycle phase of a service building, and comparing it with a specific and
   customized tool for energy efficiency assessment of public buildings. A
   service building BIM model was developed in Autodesk Revit showing its
   utility when used as an asset for storing and organize energy-related
   data. The add-in Energy Analysis for Autodesk Revit allowed
   automatically generating the Building Energy Model (BEM) from the BIM
   model and performing a cloud-based simulation in Autodesk Green Building
   Studio (GBS). The energy consumption results obtained in GBS were
   compared with the results obtained with the energy simulation tool
   ECO.AP developed in the Portuguese National Laboratory of Civil
   Engineering (LNEC). It was possible to infer that the input limitations
   of GBS, mainly in HVAC systems customization, compromise the
   representation and energy performance evaluation of the building under
   actual operating conditions, making GBS more adequate for early
   buildings life cycle stages where energy simulation results may support
   decisions that aim to improve the buildings energy performance during
   the operation phase.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Advancements in building materials and technology have led to the rapid
   development of various design solutions. At the same time, life cycle
   assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of such solutions
   have become a great burden to engineers and project managers. To help
   conduct LCA and LCCA conveniently, this study (i) analyzed the
   information needed to conduct LCA and LCCA, (ii) evaluated a way to
   obtain such information in an easy and accurate manner using a building
   information modeling tool, and (iii) developed an Excel
   spreadsheet-based framework that allowed for the simultaneous
   implementation of LCA and LCCA. The framework developed for LCA and LCCA
   was applied to a real building case to evaluate three possible
   alternatives for an external skin system. The framework could easily and
   accurately determine which skin system had good properties in terms of
   the LCA and LCCA performance. Therefore, these results are expected to
   assist in decision making based on the perspectives of economic and
   environmental performances in the early phases of a project, where
   various alternatives can be created and evaluated.},

Title = {A comprehensive model for streamlining low-energy building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1748-1756},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building designers are often limited in their ability to reduce the
   environmental impact of buildings, due to a lack of information on the
   environmental performance of building components as well as
   inconsistencies in the way in which this information is derived. Whilst
   numerous tools exist to help facilitate the low-energy building design
   process, these typically require large investments of time and money
   that are often beyond those available within any particular project.
   This paper describes an approach for streamlining the design process to
   reduce building life cycle energy consumption. Building assemblies are
   ranked based on an assessment of the life cycle energy requirements
   associated with their use within a building. This facilitates early
   stage assessment, negating the need for a resolved design before the
   relative energy requirements of alternate design solutions are known.
   Previous work assessed the initial and recurring embodied energy as well
   as the operational energy requirements for heating and cooling
   associated with the use of a range of building assemblies, using a
   simplified house model. This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of
   variations to the floor area, shape and orientation of this model, to
   test the reliability and applicability of the ranking approach across a
   broad range of circumstances. It was found that these variations did not
   influence the ranked order of the assemblies in terms of their life
   cycle energy requirements. Thus, the ranking of assemblies appears to
   provide an appropriate approach for streamlining the selection of
   construction elements during the building design process. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Inevitably, the 21st century has initiated a series of developments in
   the construction industry, leading to its digitalization and resulting
   in a series of innovative approaches and practices. At the same time,
   the construction industry, being one of the main global environment
   polluters, should fulfil well-established, as well as novel,
   sustainability requirements in order to evolve in harmony with the
   rising concerns on the availability of natural resources. This overview
   study aims to present the main developments, research, and scientific
   challenges in the field of sustainable construction, emphasizing the
   field of energy. The study aims to present a state-of-the-art scientific
   discussion on the sustainable built environment topic by analyzing
   cutting edge topics in the fields of building elements and whole
   building energy assessment, of indoor air quality and low carbon
   buildings, as well as on sustainable energy systems and smart buildings.
   The study also presents the state-of-the-art in existing tools which are
   adopted for the assessment of the sustainable built environment,
   including the use of digital tools and building information modelling
   for the energy assessment of the built environment, as well as the
   application of Life Cycle Assessment on building-related processes.
   Cross cutting issues related to the analysis of the building sector in
   the Industry 4.0 era, such as sustainability management topics and
   environmental geomatics are also discussed. The study concludes in those
   fields which will be of interest of the scientific community in the
   following years, towards achieving the goals of the sustainable
   development of the building sector.},

Abstract = {Whereas World's climate is changing (inter alia, under the influence of
   architecture activity), the author attempts to reorientations design
   practice primarily in a direction the use and adapt to the climatic
   conditions. Architectural Design using in early stages of the
   architectural Design Process of the building, among other Life Cycle
   Analysis (LCA) and digital analytical tools BIM (Building Information
   Modelling) defines the overriding requirements which the
   designer/architect should meet. The first part, the text characterized
   the architecture activity influences (by consumption, pollution, waste,
   etc.) and the use of building materials (embodied energy, embodied
   carbon, Global Warming Potential, etc.) within the meaning of the direct
   negative environmental impact. The second part, the paper presents the
   revision of the methods and analytical techniques prevent negative
   influences. Firstly, showing the study of the building by using the Life
   Cycle Analysis of the structure (e.g. materials) and functioning (e.g.
   energy consumptions) of the architectural object (stages: before use,
   use, after use). Secondly, the use of digital analytical tools for
   determining the benefits of running multi-faceted simulations in terms
   of environmental factors (exposure to light, shade, wind) directly
   affecting shaping the form of the building. The conclusion, author's
   research results highlight the fact that indicates the possibility of
   building design using the above-mentioned elements (LCA, BIM) causes
   correction, early designs decisions in the design process of
   architectural form, minimizing the impact on nature, environment. The
   work refers directly to the architectural-environmental dimensions,
   orienting the design process of buildings in respect of widely

Title = {Disassembly and deconstruction analytics system (D-DAS) for construction

Abstract = {Despite the relevance of building information modelling for simulating
   building performance at various life cycle stages, Its use for assessing
   the end-of-life impacts is not a common practice. Even though the global
   sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must
   have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In
   this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system
   is developed to provide buildings' end-of-life performance assessment
   from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing
   building information modelling capabilities in managing building design
   and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different
   layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii)
   Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The
   four layers are logically connected to function as a single system.
   Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction
   analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics
   (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for
   Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three
   scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate
   the performance of the system. The results show that building
   information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a
   platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of
   the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of
   materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction
   analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design
   for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient
   materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics
   tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and
   planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs
   to circular economy and sustainability requirements. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {Energy and resource conservation holds an inimitable significance when
   sustainability for the present as well as future comes into picture.
   With the rise of green/low-energy buildings that have reduced energy
   consumption while in operation, the exploitation of energy-intensive
   materials has increased and shifted the carbon consequences to other
   phases of building life cycle. Therefore, embodied energy of buildings
   has gained significant attention and efforts have been made to quantify
   and reduce its contribution. This paper reviews the published literature
   on embodied energy assessment of buildings from the purview of methods,
   life cycle assessment tools alone and in conjunction with other software
   tools such as building information modelling. The paper illustrates the
   progress in the embodied energy assessment till now and highlights the
   shortcomings in its standardisation due to geographical, methodical,
   temporal and boundary system differences among others. A great variation
   is displayed in the expanse of literature upon organising the results
   reported. The work also suggests future scope in the area of EE
   assessment and enhanced digitalisation to address the existing
   ambiguities.},

Title = {Integrating G2G, C2C and resource flow analysis into life cycle
   assessment framework: A case of construction steel's resource loop},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {143-152},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to model
   life cycle impact of materials that integrates both Cradle-to-Grave
   (C2G) and Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) approaches. The new approach, also
   known as the resource loop, has the capability to capture both C2G and
   C2C lifecycles of most products, processes or policies. The C2C LCA
   model represents the footprint of a product, process or policy that
   never ends (i.e., recycled or reused). It reflects the footprint of a
   product, process or policy that terminates at the end of its useful life
   (i.e., disposed or landfilled). In this paper, Material and Energy Flow
   Analysis (MEFA) is integrated into the C2C LCA model to enhance the
   model's capability to capture and integrate material and energy
   information internal and external of LCA. The flows are relabeled
   ``leaks{''} and ``feeds{''}, of which the material and energy could leak
   out of or feed into the life cycle system. The ``leaks{''} and
   ``feeds{''} reflect the flows of materials and energy in and out of the
   life cycle process. They can also be integrated with the life cycles of
   other product, process or policy. Such integration is a step closer
   toward a more comprehensive LCA model for a finished product that
   contains multiple material and energy flows (e.g., a building). Resource
   loop (RL) reflects the material and energy flows and loops of one or
   more complex systems more accurately. The RL incorporates leaks and
   feeds that reflect the reality of a product's lifecycle. Through data
   collected from selected sources, the paper illustrates the use of the
   construction steel RL. For every 1 kg of construction steel product made
   and disposed, 0.74 kg was found to remain in the loop through reuse or
   recycling. The remaining 0.26 kg ends up in landfills representing
   unrecoverable ``leaks{''}. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an up to date overview of the principal research
   topics and research trends within the Building Information Model (BIM)
   research domain. It also offers a detailed review of the integration of
   BIM and Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). The different
   strategies to improve interoperability are reviewed together with the
   various applications of such an integration (BIM with BEPS) in the
   literature.
   Firstly, a scientometric analysis which allows identifying research
   patterns and emerging trends in a specific research domain is performed
   to categorise the large number of articles constituting BIM literature
   into several clusters, each representing a particular topic. The main
   research topic in each cluster, together with the chronological progress
   and evolution of each cluster are summarized through a literature review
   of the selected highly cited articles.
   Secondly, an analysis of the different aspects relevant to the
   integration of BIM with BEPS is performed to highlight the evolution of
   the interoperability between BIM and energy simulation tools.
   Subsequently, a review of the different applications of such integration
   (BIM with BEPS) is performed to identify potential knowledge gaps.
   This study highlights six main BIM research topics focusing on BIM
   adoption and benefits, BIM-aided management, progress monitoring and
   as-built modelling, interoperability, life cycle analysis and energy
   simulation. It also emphasises the lack of well-established strategies
   to ensure the interoperability between BIM and energy simulation tools.
   Furthermore, this study reports on the poor integration of BIM and BEPS
   for building system and control modelling as well as its limited
   application during the operational phase.},

Abstract = {Building simulation is currently looking towards interdisciplinary
   experiences, aiming to the integration of simulation tools in different
   technical domains. At the same time, the interest of the building
   community to high performance buildings has also strengthened the
   interest on Life Cycle performances of such buildings, due to the
   reduction in their operational stage impacts. In this context, the paper
   proposes an integration of building simulation and Life Cycle Assessment
   through the programming of a TRNSYS component. It can perform Life Cycle
   Assessment studies, while having as output as well energy balances and
   energy and environmental payback times. Currently, the tool is tailored
   to calculate the indicators Global energy requirement and Global warming
   potential, but its flexibility allows to calculate any kind of
   indicator, if given the right inputs.
   Validation results report percentage deviations variable between 10E-3\%
   and 10E-8\% if compared to a standard Life Cycle Assessment study, thus
   it is possible to state that the Type is a reliable tool for such

Title = {BIM-enabled sustainability assessment of material supply decisions},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {668-695},
Abstract = {Purpose - Enhancing sustainability of the supply process of construction
   materials is challenging and requires accounting for a variety of
   environmental and social impacts on top of the traditional, mostly
   economic, impacts associated with a particular decision involved in the
   management of the supply chain. The economic, environmental, and social
   impacts associated with various components of a typical supply chain are
   highly sensitive to project and market specific conditions. The purpose
   of this paper is to provide decision makers with a methodology to
   account for the systematic trade-offs between economic, environmental,
   and social impacts of supply decisions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a novel framework for
   sustainability assessment of construction material supply chain
   decisions by taking advantage of the information made available by
   customized building information models (BIM) and a number of different
   databases required for assessment of life cycle impacts.
   Findings - The framework addresses the hierarchy of decisions in the
   material supply process, which consists of four levels including
   material type, source of supply, supply chain structure, and mode of
   transport. The application is illustrated using a case study.
   Practical implications - The proposed framework provides users with a
   decision-making method to select the most sustainable material
   alternative available for a building component and, thus, may be of
   great value to different parties involved in design and construction of
   a building. The multi-dimensional approach in selection process based on
   various economic, environmental, and social indicators as well as the
   life cycle perspective implemented through the proposed methodology
   advocates the life cycle thinking and the triple bottom line approach in
   sustainability. The familiarity of the new generation of engineers,
   architects, and contractors with this approach and its applications is
   essential to achieve sustainability in construction.
   Originality/value - A decision-making model for supply of materials is
   proposed by integrating the BIM-enabled life cycle assessment into
   supply chain and project constraints management. The integration is
   achieved through addition of a series of attributes to typical BIM. The
   framework is supplemented by a multi-attribute decision-making module
   based on the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution to account for the trade-offs between different economic and
   environmental impacts associated with the supply decisions.},

Title = {An open access online tool for LCA in building's early design stage in
   the Latin American context. A screening LCA case study for a bioclimatic
   building},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {Several Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools have been generated seeking to
   facilitate its application in buildings. However, most of them are
   focused on Europe or the US, leaving aside the Latin American region.
   This paper presents the EVAMED (Building Environmental Assessment tool)
   framework, a new tool developed mainly for Latin America, aimed at
   non-LCA expert users. It is analyzed how this software addresses the
   requirements established in the literature for LCA tools in early design
   phases. A screening LCA of a bioclimatic project is presented as a case
   study. A validation has been made by comparing the results obtained with
   those of a commercial software. The difference between both tools does
   not exceed an average of 40\% considering various environmental impact
   categories. The results show EVAMED covers several of the requirements
   established for LCA tools for buildings early design stages, like the
   use of regional and international databases, the BIM (Building
   Information Modeling)-LCA integration and its versatility during project
   configuration and results visualization. Bioclimatic strategies achieve
   a 30\% reduction in the carbon footprint of the case study. The use
   phase has improved its rating in the Mexican housing carbon footprint
   benchmark, going from E (78.8 kgCO2e/m2-year) to C (54.7
   kgCO2e/m2-year).},

Abstract = {With the development of economy and the improvement of living standards,
   people pay much attention to quality of dwellings rather than quantity.
   What is more, the traditional house building method is inefficient and
   the poor quality cannot meet the demand of the market. Therefore, a new
   architecture building method, prefabricated housing appears and the
   management method also needs to be changed. This article analyses the
   features of prefabricated housing in order to build a new management
   model for Chinese prefabricated housing. The theory of life cycle
   management is chosen to manage this new building mode. The technology of
   BIM and mass customization strategy are treated as basic theories to
   support this essay. Det Ljuva Livet is used as an example to prove that
   the life cycle management of prefabricated housing is reasonable and

Abstract = {The importance of analysing thermal performance in building design has
   grown, but it is still often done using simple static calculations or
   estimates. Accurate dynamic thermal simulation software have been
   available already for decades, but these tools are still not widely used
   by practitioners in building projects.
   The main barrier of wider usage of dynamic thermal analysis methods has
   been the required big manual input work. By utilising BIM as a data
   source for thermal analysis, the data input will be more efficient and
   the existing data more reusable. BIM facilitates easier verification of
   the thermal performance in different phases of the building process.
   This paper shows the recent developments for new concept and
   interoperable software environment to manage spatial thermal performance
   during the whole building life cycle. Results of using the developed
   concept are shown from real projects.},

   scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {434},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Residential buildings have a substantial impact on global environmental
   impacts. In this paper we present a model that assesses impacts from
   materials (embodied impacts) as well as from heating (operational
   impacts) for all residential buildings in Switzerland. Our model builds
   on an existing high-resolution spatio-temporal building stock model,
   which estimates the space heating demand of buildings, based on building
   property and site data. In this work we additionally include the impacts
   of materials extraction, production, transportation, and disposal of
   building components (floors, roofs, walls, ceilings and windows). Our
   model comes with a site-and building-specific default parametrization
   for all buildings, but it is developed as a tool that allows architects
   and planners to adapt building and site data with specific information
   to increase the accuracy of the environmental assessment of the current
   buildings and future building-management scenarios. We applied the model
   to ten Swiss buildings and assessed a selection of building-management
   scenarios to illustrate the application of the tool. The results show
   that our model estimates fairly accurate values of thermal and
   ventilation heat transmittance, operational space heating demand, and
   operational and embodied climate-change impacts for the considered
   buildings. The detailed modeling results for the ten case study
   buildings outperformed the simplified version of the model with generic
   default values for material building composition (using age-grouped
   building archetypes), emphasizing the importance of adding detailed
   material information in building life cycle assessments. Therefore, a
   focus should be placed on obtaining accurate material inventories of
   buildings in future research. The here-developed model allows for
   integration of such detailed material inventories, overwriting the
   provided default values.},

Title = {An Automatic Generation Method of Finite Element Model Based on BIM and
   Ontology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For the mechanical analysis work in the structural design phase, data
   conversion and information transfer between BIM model and finite element
   model have become the main factors limiting its efficiency and quality,
   with the development of BIM (building information modeling) technology
   application in the whole life cycle. The combined application of BIM and
   ontology technology has promoted the automation of compliance checking,
   cost management, green building evaluation, and many other fields. Based
   on OpenBIM, this study combines IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and
   the ontology system and proposes an automatic generation method for
   converting BIM to the finite element model. Firstly, the elements
   contained in the finite element model are generalized and the
   information set requirement, to be extracted or inferred from BIM for
   the generation of the finite element model, is obtained accordingly.
   Secondly, the information extraction technical route is constructed to
   satisfy the acquisition of the information set, including three main
   aspects, i.e., IFC-based material information, spatial information, and
   other basic information; ontology-based finite element cell selection
   method; and APDL statement generation methods based on JAVA, C\#, etc.
   Finally, a complete technical route and a software architecture,
   designed for converting BIM to the finite element model, are derived. To
   assess the feasibility of the method, a simple structure is tested in
   this paper, and the result indicates that the automatic decision-making
   reasoning mechanism of constructing element type and meshing method can
   be explored by ontology and IFC. This study contributes to the body of
   knowledge by providing an efficient method for automatic generation of
   the BIM structure model and a reference for future applications using
   BIM in structural analysis.},

Title = {Streamlined environmental and cost life-cycle approach for building
   thermal retrofits: A case of residential buildings in South European

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {172},

Abstract = {Building retrofits are often motivated by the desire to improve the
   energy efficiency of a building. However, environmental burdens
   associated with additional materials used to accomplish energy
   efficiency are not usually taken into account. Life-cycle assessment
   (LCA) and life-cycle cost assessment (LCCA) approaches have been
   extensively applied to analyze building environmental impacts and costs.
   However, LCA and LCCA are time-consuming and resource-intensive and are
   usually performed in late design stages when significant reduction in
   total life-cycle impacts is costly to achieve. The aim of this article
   is to present an integrated, streamlined LCA-LCCA approach to building
   retrofits to provide feedback on environmental impacts and costs at
   early-design stage decisions. We propose a framework that fully
   integrates a streamlined embodied LCA, statistical-based operational
   energy, and cost models. This approach incorporates uncertainty to
   address the lack of information in early design stages by using the
   building attribute to impact algorithm approach, which includes
   structured under-specification and probabilistic triage. An automated
   process enables several scenarios to be assessed and compared as a means
   of better informing designers of the relative environmental impact of
   materials and dimensioning choices. It is demonstrated that by selecting
   very few attributes and then comparing several options, robust retrofit
   decisions can be made in early-design stages, thereby promoting a
   reduction in environmental impacts and costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Modelling (BIM). Most efforts build on information technology
   capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains
   associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is
   predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track
   project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now
   being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages.
   However, research suggests that the building operation and management
   stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using
   building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication.
   It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that
   encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the
   evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the
   design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance
   issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy
   consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a
   BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the
   framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled
   tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data
   from the operations phase of another school delivered previously. We
   conclude that the framework developed in this research can contribute to
   bridging existing gaps between the design, construction and operation
   phases of a building's life-cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A Stochastic Approach to LCA of Internal Insulation Solutions for
   Historic Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Internal insulation is a typical renovation solution in historic
   buildings with valuable facades. However, it entails moisture-related
   risks, which affect the durability and life-cycle environmental
   performance. In this context, the EU project RIBuild developed a risk
   assessment method for both hygrothermal and life-cycle performance of
   internal insulation, to support decision-making. This paper presents the
   stochastic Life Cycle Assessment method developed, which couples the LCA
   model to a Monte-Carlo simulation, providing results expressed by
   probability distributions. It is applied to five insulation solutions,
   considering different uncertain input parameters and building heating
   scenarios. In addition, the influence of data variability and quality on
   the result is analyzed, by using input data from two sources:
   distributions derived from a generic Life Cycle Inventory database and
   ``deterministic{''} data from Environmental Product Declarations. The
   outcomes highlight remarkable differences between the two datasets that
   lead to substantial variations on the systems performance ranking at the
   production stage. Looking at the life-cycle impact, the general trend of
   the output distributions is quite similar among simulation groups and
   insulation systems. Hence, while a ranking of the solutions based on a
   ``deterministic{''} approach provides misleading information, the
   stochastic approach provides more realistic results in the context of
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) employs data-rich 3D CAD models for
   large-scale facility design, construction, and operation. These complex
   datasets contain a large amount and variety of information, ranging from
   design specifications to real-time sensor data. They are used by
   architects and engineers for various analysis and simulations throughout
   a facility's life cycle. Many techniques from different visualization
   fields could be used to analyze these data. However, the BIM domain
   still remains largely unexplored by the visualization community. The
   goal of this article is to encourage visualization researchers to
   increase their involvement with BIM. To this end, we present the results
   of a systematic review of visualization in current BIM practice. We use
   a novel taxonomy to identify main application areas and analyze commonly
   employed techniques. From this domain characterization, we highlight
   future research opportunities brought forth by the unique features of
   BIM. For instance, exploring the synergies between scientific and
   information visualization to integrate spatial and non-spatial data. We
   hope this article raises awareness to interesting new challenges the BIM
   domain brings to the visualization community.},

Title = {IFC-based embodied carbon benchmarking for early design analysis},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Current legislation focuses on reducing the operational carbon impact of
   buildings. However, the production of materials used in construction
   generates a considerable amount of carbon, known as embodied carbon,
   that accounts for a sizeable fraction of the environmental impact of a
   building during its lifecycle. We present a newly developed tool, pycab,
   which calculates the embodied carbon of a building directly at the
   design stage and compares it to the Royal Institute of British
   Architects (RIBA) 2030 Climate Challenge Target Benchmarks. As input,
   the tool uses standard Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files that can
   be produced directly from existing Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   software. The pycab tool enables industry professionals to make design
   stage decisions that reduce the embodied carbon impact of their
   projects. This research demonstrates one of the many potential uses that
   digital tools can have in reducing the environmental impact of the
   construction industry.},

Abstract = {In the life cycle of buildings, plenty of different disciplines and
   companies are involved. Therefore, a unified information base for the
   whole building and its components and technical equipment is highly
   beneficial. One approach aiming at this goal is Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). There exist standards mostly focusing on architectural
   and building physical properties, like the Green Building XML schema
   (gbXML). A further improvement would be to include a description of the
   technical equipment and building automation components as well, and to
   make the resulting model accessible in a unified way. This paper aims at
   a holistic knowledge base for buildings providing views on static
   building and automation systems configuration as well as runtime
   information, i.e., access to live values of datapoint originating in the
   building automation systems. This includes sensor values, setpoints,
   calculated or aggregated values as well as time series of historical
   values.},

Abstract = {With the continuous increase in the number of buildings, the phenomenon
   of excessively high energy consumption becomes more and more serious. It
   is particularly important to reduce the energy consumption during the
   operation of the whole life cycle of the building. Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) technology is based on the relevant parameters of
   construction projects, and uses digital information simulation to
   establish building information models. It is one of the technical means
   of building energy consumption analysis and energy saving management,
   that can be explained as the main reason for stakeholders to guide
   energy and efficiency changes of the driving factor in buildings. We
   start co-occurrence statistics and type analysis based on the
   co-occurrence context analysis, construct the co-occurrence information
   that affects the values and barriers combination of BIM implementation
   for smart building energy and efficiency, and chose the expert database
   of the Green Construction and Intelligent Building Branch (GCIBB) of
   China Construction Association, that obtained 104 samples through
   modified snowball sampling, using exploratory factor analysis with
   factor load linear functions, and combined factor variance contribution
   rate weights. We created index function of the values and barriers
   combination of BIM implementation in smart building energy and
   efficiency, and classified and calculated the comprehensive score of
   each factor according to the ranking evaluation index, and mapped its
   practical significance. The results show that the 18 combined evaluation
   indicators proposed in this paper are suitable for evaluating the three
   elements of benefit, efficiency and quality of smart buildings, and can
   achieve continuous optimization of building energy consumption. The
   constructed multi-factor combination evaluation model, the extracted
   common factor variance cumulative contribution rate is greater than
   80\%. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The quality of information flow management has a remarkable effect on
   the entire life cycle of buildings. Manual retrieval of technical
   specifications and features of building components and their performance
   assessment leads to increased cost and time and efficiency reduction,
   especially during the facility management (FM) stage. The introduction
   of building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry can
   provide a valuable means of improving the organization and exchange of
   information. BIM tools integrate multiple levels of information within a
   single digital model of a building. Nevertheless, the support given by
   BIM to FM is far from being fully effective. Technicians can benefit
   from real-time communication with the data repository whenever the need
   for gathering contextual information and/or updating any data in the
   digital model arises. The framework proposed in this study aims to
   develop a system that supports on-site operations. Information
   requirements have been determined from the analyses of procedures that
   are usually implemented in the building life cycle. These studies set
   the standard for the development of a digital model of a building, which
   will be shared among various actors in charge of FM and accessed via a
   cloud platform. Moreover, mixed reality is proposed to support specific
   information that is relevant to geometric features and procedures to be
   followed by operators. This article presents three use-cases supported
   by the proposed framework. In addition, this research article describes
   the first proof of concept regarding real-time support for FM.},

Title = {CONSISTENT MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION OF BUILDING MODELS IN THE EARLY
   DESIGN STAGES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {212-232},
Abstract = {The early stages of building design involve the consideration of
   different design variants and their assessment regarding various
   performance criteria including energy consumption and costs. During the
   design process, the involved experts from different disciplines
   frequently exchange building information to develop a design that
   satisfies the project's requirements and objectives. In the course of
   this iterative process, the building design evolves throughout multiple
   refinement stages. At the same time, different variants are developed.
   In BIM-based projects, the maturity of the design information provided
   by the model is expressed by the notion of Level of development (LOD).
   So far, however, there is no method to formally define the information
   requirements of a LOD. In particular, there are no means for expressing
   the uncertainty involved with the provided information. By contrast,
   despite the insufficient information available in early design stages, a
   BIM model appears precise and certain. This situation leads to false
   assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy
   efficiency calculations or structural analysis. Hence, this paper
   presents an overview of a set of approaches that were developed to
   alleviate and preserve the consistency of the designed solutions. The
   approach includes the development of a multi-LOD meta-model, which
   allows one to explicitly describe the LOD requirements of each building
   component type incorporating the possible uncertainties, e.g. concerning
   the building dimensions. On the basis of this multi-LOD model, methods
   for evaluating a building design's performance regarding the building's
   structure and life cycle energy performance are proposed that take the
   defined uncertainties into account. To support the management of design
   variants in one consistent model, a graph-based approach is introduced.
   Finally, a minimized communication protocol is described to facilitate
   the workflow and communicate the evaluation results for supporting the
   decision-making process.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gases associated with energy extraction, production, and
   consumption are considered a major source of environmental pollution
   that has led to global warming and climate change. In Saudi Arabia, the
   building sector represents the largest domain of total energy
   consumption (roughly 80\%) followed by the industrial and agricultural
   sectors. This study seeks to assess the environmental impacts and
   economic viability of various construction systems including
   prefabricated and conventional ones using models for life cycle cost
   (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA used in this study was
   assigned monetary values according to the market price of CO2 and then
   combined with the LCC. The developed LCA-LCC therefore provides
   information regarding the sustainability of the construction method and
   may assist decision makers in public sector on the selection of the best
   possible construction system to minimize energy consumption, greenhouse
   gas emission, and environmental impact while simultaneously reducing
   overall life cycle costs. The highest LCC was associated with
   construction costs, which represented 55\% to 58\% of the whole LCC. The
   operation and maintenance costs of the project over a 50-year lifespan
   ranged between 25\% and 27\% of the overall LCC, while the environmental
   impact cost was found to represent approximately 17.0\% to 18\% of the
   total LCC.},

Title = {Integrating BIM-LCA to Enhance Sustainability Assessments of
   Constructions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The need for sustainable practices in the construction sector has never
   been more pressing, as the sector seeks to mitigate its carbon
   footprint, water consumption, and waste generation. The integration of
   building information modeling (BIM) and life-cycle assessment (LCA)
   emerges as a promising solution for rapidly and accurately evaluating
   the environmental impact of construction. This integration has the
   potential to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, paving the
   way for a more environmentally conscious future in the construction
   sector. However, there are still challenges to overcome before this is a
   standard procedure. Data interoperability and standardized
   classifications necessitate ongoing research. To understand the
   potential of BIM-LCA integration in minimizing carbon emissions in
   constructions, this study focuses on a hypothetical renovation project,
   unraveling the mechanics of BIM-LCA integration and exploring its
   challenges and opportunities. While the existing literature acknowledges
   the potential benefits of BIM-LCA integration, few research efforts
   delve into the specific issues that practitioners may face. Our approach
   seeks to fill this gap by presenting a holistic view of the integration
   process, highlighting the practical steps and addressing the intricacies
   involved. The results show that the most relevant information when
   performing a BIM-LCA integration using Revit (R) (v 2022) and OneClick
   LCA (OCL) is the name-property given to the materials within Revit (R).
   Despite the advances made by this semi-automated approach,
   interoperability and data accessibility challenges remain. The results
   show that automated material identification relies on Revit (R)
   classifications and necessitates careful modeling practices to prevent
   impact-calculation redundancy.},

Title = {The Effects of Using a Trombe Wall Modified with a Phase Change
   Material, from the Perspective of a Building's Life Cycle},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing costs related to the use of primary energy carriers, and
   greater social awareness related to the need for energy saving,
   necessitate the use of renewable energy sources, including solar
   radiation. The Trombe wall (thermal storage wall-TSW) is an indirect
   passive solar energy system solution, aimed at obtaining, storing, and
   transferring thermal energy into buildings. However, there is no
   comprehensive information on the impact of the use of such solutions on
   environmental performance in the life cycle of buildings, especially
   those located in temperate climates. The aim of this paper is therefore
   to determine the environmental impact of the construction of barriers
   using phase change materials (PCM) from the perspective of the life
   cycle of a model building conforming to the current Polish energy
   standard (EP < 70 kWh/(m(2)center dot yr)). The subject of the research
   is the structure of a TSW using phase change materials and a reference
   wall with a maximum overall heat transfer coefficient of 0.2 W/m(2)K. A
   comprehensive computational model of a residential building located in
   Rzesz \& oacute;w, Poland, was created, taking into account the thermal
   parameters of the analyzed structure of the wall and its operation under
   real, specific climatic conditions, as well as the environmental
   characteristics. High-quality input data (based on real, long-term
   measurements) were used to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment of the
   analyzed variants. As a result, the energetic and environmental
   efficiency of the analyzed thermal storage wall, from the perspective of
   the whole building's life cycle, were assessed. According to the
   analyzed data, a TSW modified with paraffin enables the reduction of the
   energy requirements for heating by 11.3\%, and the payback period of the
   environmental load does not exceed 1 (GWP) and 5 (IMPACT2002+) years,
   which were lower than the monitored period of operation.},

Abstract = {Developments in the construction industry across a number of countries
   over the past decade suggest that the use of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) is becoming the norm for the design and delivery of
   projects. As BIM increasingly enters a broad range of domains within the
   built environment, the importance of Specialist Contractors - and in
   particular MEP Contractors as part of these developments begins to show.
   MEP Contractors form a crucial link in the information-chain to achieve
   life-cycle BIM. This paper investigates the shift to the role of MEP
   Contractors in the context of BIM. It analyses the structural changes
   within the contracting professions, and it highlights the impact of BIM
   enabled MEP Contractors on the construction industry as a whole. The
   paper scrutinises this development by example of the BIM-MEPAUS
   initiative of the Australian Air Conditioning and Mechanical
   Contractors' Association (AMCA). Accounts from BIM-MEPAUS illustrate the
   raise of the BIM-enabled MEP Contractors and thereby act as a reference
   for other international industry groups who may wish to follow their
   example.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a revolutionary stride of
   technology towards the orthodox construction and procedures in
   conventional Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.
   The strength of BIM has been undervalued on the eyes of many
   professionals as to think of BIM as just another `software' which is in
   reality, a `process' of attaining an outstanding collaboration among
   every stakeholder throughout a project's life cycle. Thus, the purpose
   of this study is to develop a foreseeable information flow model related
   to the Construction Supply Chain (CSC) of a BIM aided project. This
   study administered a qualitative approach. Data was collected through
   semi-structured interviews with 10 experts, due to the lack of expertize
   with actual implementation experiences in the subject matter. The data
   were analysed using manual content analysis. The outcomes revealed that
   BIM standards have laid down charismatic arrangements on information
   flows among BIM project stakeholders, which is, in reality, a complex
   and random setup. The research outcome has successfully answered the
   complications in complex information setup of a BIM project by laying
   down guidance for any outsider to the BIM field as to recognize on what
   would be the contribution of each stakeholder throughout its BIM
   project's life cycle.},

   presents special challenges when considering embodied energy or carbon,

   propagation (AUP) may in certain conditions have advantages over
   sampling-based methods for the uncertainty analysis of initial embodied
   impacts of composite building services components. A case study shows
   that the use of AUP combined with parametric prediction could enable
   estimation of embodied energy of composite building services components
   incorporating uncertainty analysis. This approach could support rapid
   estimation of whole life energy and carbon impacts of building services
   systems and components, implemented using BIM.},

Title = {Comparative Evaluation Model Framework for Cost-Optimal Evaluation of
   Prefabricated Lightweight System Envelopes in the Early Design Phase},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an extended comparative evaluation model framework
   (ECEMF) that highlights two objectives: (1) a specific economic
   evaluation method for the cost-optimisation of prefabricated lightweight
   system envelopes to achieve a greater value of the building, and (2) a
   comparative evaluation model framework usable by different profiles of
   stakeholders, when adopting the decision on the most optimal envelope
   type in the early design phase. Based on the proposed framework, the
   analysis was conducted for the case study building representing a small
   single-family house located in Slovenia. The methodology applied is
   based on the life cycle cost (LCC) including construction, operation,
   maintenance, and refurbishment costs, but excluding dismantling,
   disposal, and reuse, for the period of 50 years' lifetime of the
   building which combines the Building Information Modelling (BIM) with
   Value for Money (VfM) assessment. To exploit the automated evaluation
   process in the computing environment, several tools were used, including
   Archicad for BIM in combination with Legep software for LCC. On one
   hand, the model confirms the assumption that the optimal value
   parameters of a building do not only depend on the typical costs related
   to high-performance buildings. On the other hand, from the stakeholders'
   view, the model enables the choice of the optimal solution regarding the
   envelope type to be made in the early design phase. In this view, the
   model could function as an important decision tool, with a direct
   economic impact on the value.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an established approach in the
   construction industry that enables efficient collaboration between
   stakeholders and facilitates project management. However, when it comes
   to historical buildings, the application of BIM can be demanding due to
   the complex nature of these projects. Although BIM Uses in the
   construction sector are well-documented (Penn State University, 2013)
   and we are surrounded by amazing technologies, we do not yet have
   standardized international workflows on how to use those
   state-of-the-art techniques with Cultural Heritage Assets (Bruno and
   Roncella, 2019). Standardizing Cultural Heritage (CH) metric
   documentation and Heritage/Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM)
   is challenging since each CH asset needs different information
   throughout the whole life cycle of the monument - both their physical
   and non-physical attributes, such as historical and cultural
   characteristics. Additionally, every work carried out on CH, such as
   knowledge acquisition, restoration, adaptation, etc., requires specific
   data inputs. Although there are guidelines books that offer some general
   proposals, they represent the maximum effort towards standardization. As
   a result, the field of HBIM has emerged as a relatively new area of
   scientific research that focuses on the digital representation of CH
   assets.
   This research aims to develop a working method and templates for
   procurement workflow standardization that will facilitate the
   documentation of historic buildings and heritage assets in coordination
   with relevant historic preservation authorities for the BIM use case -
   asset register. The use of various measurement methods, the registration
   of captured point clouds, and the transfer of geometry to a
   BIM-compliant 3D information model and sustainable data storage are
   important aspects of this project.},

Abstract = {Geospatial information modelling (GIM) is used for decades to document
   phenomena of the real world. Visualizing and analysing GIM data are
   usually accomplished by geographic information system tools. The
   construction industry, on the other hand, uses usually computer-aided
   design (CAD) tools to plan buildings. With the introduction of building
   information modelling (BIM), modelling in CAD was enhanced to the entire
   life cycle of constructions. BIM and GIM are not independent of each
   other, e.g. BIM uses geospatial data for planning purposes. However,
   integrating both is challenging since the modelling methods differ. The
   paper describes approaches to establish interoperability between models
   of both domains. A literature review reveals the problems and challenges
   different researchers tackled to achieve interoperability.},

Abstract = {Conventional practice on managing information in construction has
   sometimes created a miscommunication and errors among construction
   players. Therefore, Information Communication Technology (ICT) has
   introduced Building Information Modeling (BIM) for managing construction
   projects effectively and efficiently. Different terms on definition of
   BIM have been used and expanded widely with different perspectives. The
   aim of this paper is to explore the notion of BIM development from the
   year of 1975 to 2013. The methodology of this paper is based on
   literature review on BIM definitions. The findings reveal that there are
   six perspectives in BIM development which are design, estimation,
   construction process, building life cycle, performance and technology.
   From the development of BIM, it can be concluded that BIM is a new
   methodology that involves the use of technologies in order to improve
   collaboration and communication of construction players as well as the
   management of documentation.},

Abstract = {Scientific community and practitioners of the Architecture, Engineering
   and Construction (AEC) sector have been developing life-cycle cost (LCC)
   concept for the past decades. However, information on a building's
   economic performance throughout its life-cycle is seldom readily
   available or accurate. This hinders the fulfilment of recommendations of
   international and regional standards, procurement guidelines and
   regulations, and for building management (BM) professionals to fully
   incorporate the LCC concept into their daily practice. This paper seeks
   to contribute to solving these difficulties by presenting a conceptual
   framework that enables LCC-informed decisions in BM, together with its
   empirical application to a portfolio of 158 public school buildings in
   Portugal (constructed area of 1,437,594 m(2)). It involved the
   gathering, organization and treatment of historical data of school
   buildings originally constructed from 1942 onwards. The historical
   analysis is presented in the form of three types of economic life-cycle
   key performance indicators (time series, indexes and relative ratios).
   It originated a database with more than 1.4 million results that offer a
   profound understanding of historical economic performance of this
   portfolio. The results can be adapted and used to benchmark or estimate
   construction, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement,
   rehabilitation, energy consumption, water consumption and deconstruction
   costs of buildings throughout the world.},

Title = {Three-Dimensional Parametric Data Exchange for Curved Steel Bridges},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2331},
Pages = {27-34},
Abstract = {Improved software interoperability is key to realizing more fully the
   potential benefits of integrated and accelerated project delivery in a
   way that also somehow ensures product quality. The increasing appeal of
   three-dimensional (3-D) building information modeling (BIM) notions
   applied to bridges {[}known as bridge information modeling (BrIM)]
   motivates the need for principled prescriptions of associated electronic
   data exchanges between various project stakeholders and the various
   software applications that they use. Such data exchanges must be
   sufficiently precise to facilitate detailing for fabrication and
   construction while being sufficiently concise to facilitate parametric
   modeling and thereby avoid needless data duplication. The highway
   geometry to which bridges must conform distinguishes BrIM from the
   building column grid orientation of BIM at the outset of the bridge life
   cycle. In contrast to the overdefined highway geometry in the LandXML
   data exchange standard, a 3-D control curve is defined, presented,
   illustrated, and recommended as the basis for parametric data exchange
   suitable through the life cycle of steel I-girder bridges on (straight
   and) curved alignments. This 3-D control curve combines in a single
   curve the traditional horizontal control line and profile grade line
   that bridge structural engineers receive from highway designers to
   define bridge geometry. Data exchanges associated with three distinct
   stages in the life cycle of a steel bridge are defined and illustrated:
   analysis and design, detailing for fabrication, and erection and
   construction. The data exchange based on a 3-D control curve provides
   the data integrity required through the life cycle of a steel bridge.},

Abstract = {Currently, the construction industry is turning towards sustainability.
   Nevertheless, in order to achieve a sustainable performance, a balance
   between environmental, social and economic criteria has to be created.
   There are already different tools available which have the potential to
   reach this goal. It is necessary to identify them as such and find out
   how they can be integrated to obtain synergies and contribute to
   sustainable construction. These tools have to be implemented in early
   design phases so as to add value to the project. In the present paper,
   two powerful methods, namely BIM and LCA, will be highlighted. Such
   methods can be of great assistance in the context of sustainability. On
   the one hand, BIM supports integrated design and improves information
   management and cooperation between the different stakeholders throughout
   the different project life-cycle phases. On the other hand, LCA is a
   suitable method for assessing environmental performance. Both LCA and
   BIM should be integrated in the decision-making process at an early
   stage with a view to achieving a holistic overview of the project,
   including environmental criteria, from the beginning. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {In the whole life cycle of buildings, proper building energy management
   is important to achieve energy efficiency. In this research, Building
   Energy Model (BEM) was used to analyze the energy consumption of a hotel
   building. The BEM of the building with information of the HVAC system
   was established to simulate the energy consumption. The performance of
   the HVAC system was measured using the sub-metering technology. The
   comparison between the simulation results and the measured performance
   revealed several problems of the HVAC system in operation, including
   unreasonable setpoint temperature of the chilled water and a small
   temperature difference between the supplied and returned chilled water.
   The BEM was adjusted to take into account the real operational load.
   Finally, an optimal setpoint temperature schedule of the chilled water
   was proposed to reduce the operational energy consumption of the HVAC
   system.},

Abstract = {The block type and structural systems in buildings affect the amount of
   building materials required as well as the CO2 emissions that occur
   throughout the building life cycle (LCCO2). The purpose of this study
   was to assess the life cycle CO2 emissions when an apartment housing
   with `flat-type' blocks (the reference case) was replaced with more
   sustainable `T-type' blocks with fewer CO2 emissions (the alternative
   case) maintaining the same total floor area. The quantity of building
   materials used and building energy simulations were analyzed for each
   block type using building information modeling techniques, and
   improvements in LCCO2 emission were calculated by considering
   high-strength concrete alternatives. By changing the bearing wall system
   of the `flat-type' block to the `column and beam' system of the `T-type'
   block, LCCO2 emissions of the alternative case were 4299 kg-CO2/m(2), of
   which 26\% was at the construction stage, 73\% was as the operational
   stage and 1\% was at the dismantling and disposal stage. These total
   LCCO2 emissions were 30\% less than the reference case.},

Title = {BIM-Based Digital Construction Strategies to Evaluate Carbon Emissions
   in Green Prefabricated Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the integration of building information
   modeling (BIM) technology to assess carbon emissions, emphasizing the
   unique contributions to smart and sustainable approaches in
   prefabricated buildings and focusing on the application of digital
   construction strategies facilitated by BIM to evaluate carbon emissions
   in green prefabricated buildings, with a detailed case study on C-House
   at Southeast University, Nanjing, China. The research methodology
   involved creating a BIM model of C-House in Rhino and collecting data
   from the operationalization phase. This research work delves into
   analyzing the structural components, on-site assembling process, and
   evaluation of carbon emissions by using a BIM-based assessment, as well
   as the energy load and consumption of prefabricated components,
   including sustainable PV panels, to enhance building efficiency and
   sustainability. The findings uncover the life cycle of C-House, which
   spans seven stages, compared with the five stages of conventional
   builds. Currently in its third cycle, C-House exhibits significant
   reductions of 70.57\% in carbon emissions during the second cycle and
   43.53\% in the first one. This highlights the pattern showing that the
   prolonged reuse of prefabricated buildings leads to decreasing emissions
   over time. Such results underscore the potential carbon emission
   reductions and environmental advantages of reusing green prefabricated
   buildings. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the entire
   life cycle of the building, from inception to occupation and post-phase
   performance evaluation. By employing BIM for modeling, simulation, and
   analysis, we offer practical insights into the application of smart
   technologies for sustainable construction practices, significantly
   contributing to the advancement of green and digital construction
   technologies.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present an Integrated Life Cycle Bridge
   Information Modeling that can be used throughout different phases of the

   obtaining optimum construction methods and performing structural
   advanced analysis. During construction phase, the model selects the
   appropriate locations for mobile cranes, monitors the status of precast

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the goals and initial findings from a project
   whose aim is to create robust and practical life cycle assessment (LCA)
   tools to assess the performance of buildings. A central feature of this
   project is the concept of a dynamic LCA framework for buildings, which
   should include, but is not limited to; considering temporal variations
   in internal and external conditions during a building's operating
   lifetime, and incorporating the ability to rapidly update the LCA
   results based on changes to the building's design or operation (dynamic
   scenario modeling). A life cycle assessment (LCA) framework is necessary
   to understand how buildings and their occupants use materials, water,
   and energy resources, and are affected by the building's internal
   environmental quality throughout the its lifetime. However, LCA is not
   commonly used in building industry practice. This disparity is
   hypothesized to be the result of several factors: the perceived and
   actual complexity of LCA's application; the lack of inclusion of
   internal building effects important to practitioners and users, such as
   indoor environmental quality (IEQ); and the lack of detailed information
   on the dynamics of the building's use phase. This paper describes the
   feasibility of deploying a real-time, wireless sensor network to
   generate a dynamic LCA for buildings. Using the data collected from a
   sensor network, projections of the environmental impact of a building's
   use phase can be validated or improved. Building systems that
   demonstrate a highly variable impact on the LCA results or diverge
   widely from current predictions can be selected for additional study,
   and choices regarding where to expend finite resources in sensor
   applications can be refined.},

Title = {Influence of BIM's level of detail on the environmental impact of
   buildings: Danish context},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {245},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Integrating a BIM-based life-cycle assessment (LCA) in the early design
   stages of building projects can promote a reduction of environmental
   impacts. However, the reliability of the analysis depends on the quality
   of the model. BIM modelling of timber-frame construction is often
   simplified, potentially hindering the LCA outcome due to quantity
   inaccuracy and a failure to consider elements regarded as negligible.
   This study addresses the meth-odological problem that influences the
   calculation of the environmental impact by examining the various
   environmental impacts caused by inventory data obtained from BIM models
   with a level of detail of (LOD) 350-400 vs LOD200. The environmental
   impacts obtained from both models of a timber building calculated
   through an attributional LCA method are compared. Material inventory
   sourced from the LOD200 model results in a 14.7\% lower value of
   embodied impact. The discrepancies resulted from aluminium, mineral wool
   and bitumen, which are identified as critical materials requiring
   quantity adjustment. Relying on simplified BIM models for LCA may lead
   to the GWP being under-estimated with incorrect identification of
   hotspots in the early design stages. The results aksi question the
   cut-off criterion of the current EN15978 norm that serves as a
   foundation for developing environmental policies within the industry. It
   recommends exclusion of materials constituting less than 1\% of the
   overall mass from the system boundary. This study underscores the
   potential significance of materials falling below this threshold,
   challenging the validity of the criterion, and suggesting that such
   materials should be carefully evaluated and included in the LCA to
   ensure a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts. The
   overall objective of the study is to emphasize the importance of
   employing accurate BIM models in LCAs to make informed decisions that
   are aligned with the sustainability goals, encouraging practitioners to
   consider the impact of critical materials, even those with seemingly
   minimal con-tributions. With this knowledge, the practitioners are able
   to take meaningful actions that compensate for the LCA uncertainty,
   mitigating the environmental burden of the most impactful areas. Most
   importantly, the findings aim to identify the error in design LCA versus
   as-built studies, helping to develop design LCA tools that predict the
   as-built impact more precisely and earlier in the design process. The
   findings can also improve the expected building model definition in
   carbon policies.},

Abstract = {Because a construction project is being larger in size and complicated
   in structure, to be a successful construction project, various
   information technologies should be used for the project management
   through life-cycle. The representative IT tools are RFID/USN (Radio
   Frequency IDentification/Ubiquitous Sensor Network) and BIM (Building
   Information Modeling) system. BIM is that the construction information
   through the life-cycle of a construction project, including design,
   construction and maintenance phases, is managed by 3D objects. AR
   (Augmented Reality) can be used in the construction project as one of
   BIM item. AR technology can be used to establish a real-life
   construction model by overlaying virtual object data against the actual
   background of a project site on a computer. This study proposes a
   methodology of applying the AR technology to a construction project and
   a prototype system to test applicability of the AR technology in rebar
   construction work. Application of the AR technology to construction
   processes may enhance workability as it displays missing design elements
   compared to the initial drawings.},

Abstract = {Sustainable comfortable living requires comprehensive energy consumption
   planning for the housing habitat. Besides other energy planning
   considerations, the variations in physical features of built facilities,
   their environmental interaction, and resulting operational life cycle
   carbon footprint are an important focus in contemporary research.
   Therefore, this research aims to explore the relationship between the
   physical features of the built facility and the resulting carbon
   footprint for conventional housing designs. A combination of
   conventional Malaysian model housing units was developed in 3D virtual
   prototypes by building information modeling, and regression analysis was
   used to investigate the environmental impact paradigm of the built
   facility. Correspondingly, an operational CO2 pre-assessment was also
   examined by the partial life cycle assessment technique during the early
   stages of design and planning. The results of this study show a positive
   and statistically significant linear relation of carbon footprint with
   the area, volume, and power rating parameters. The outcome of this study
   is imperative for designing resource-efficient living facilities and
   achieving a sustainable built environment through a proactive life cycle
   assessment of housing construction projects.},

Title = {Analysis of the Impact of Photovoltaic Curtain Walls Replacing Glass
   Curtain Walls on the Whole Life Cycle Carbon Emission of Public
   Buildings Based on BIM Modeling Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The construction industry plays a crucial role in achieving global
   carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study is to explore the
   application of photovoltaic curtain walls in building models and analyze
   their impact on carbon emissions in order to find the best adaptation
   method that combines economy and carbon reduction. Through a carbon
   emissions calculation and economic analysis of replacing photovoltaic
   curtain walls on a large public building in Zhenjiang, China, the
   results showed that after replacing glass curtain walls with
   photovoltaic curtain walls, the carbon emissions during the construction
   operation stage decreased by 30.74\%, but the carbon emissions during
   the production and transportation stage of building materials increased
   by 10.48\%. The carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of the
   building have been reduced by 20.99\%. This indicates that photovoltaic
   curtain wall technology has the potential to reduce building carbon
   emissions. Further promoting the development of production technology
   and sales routes for photovoltaic curtain walls and accelerating the
   improvement of carbon trading systems can further improve the carbon
   emission reduction effect of buildings. This study provides practical
   reference for public buildings in similar areas and guidance for
   reducing carbon emissions in the future.},

Title = {Human Toxicological Impacts in Life Cycle Assessment of Circular Economy
   of the Built Environment: A Case Study of Denmark},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The circular economy has become an important topic in the building
   industry, and life cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to quantify its
   benefits. Through chemical analysis, this article demonstrates that the
   current LCA is not yet well-adapted to assess the circular economy of
   building materials and components. It is shown that current inventory
   data and models are insufficient because they do not consider the uptake
   and emission of chemicals during use, the migration of chemicals within
   the value chain across the multiple phases in the circular economy, and
   because current characterization models lack a large fraction of the
   potentially emitted chemicals from said uptake and emission identified
   in the tested building material samples. Thus, it is shown that impacts
   relevant for LCA in the circular economy of buildings remain unaddressed
   because they are currently either omitted in the LCA that covers a
   limited number of impact indicators, or are ostensibly covered in the
   LCA covering a full set of indicators but missed due to inadequate
   characterization models. To ameliorate this, a definition of embedded
   toxicity and its relationship to the toxicological footprint is
   presented and a method for measurement is proposed, illustrating how
   assessing embedded toxicity can yield information for facilitating safe
   building-material reuse. Finally, a suggestion for the improvement of
   life cycle impact assessment methods is proposed.},

Title = {Evaluating the impact of operating energy reduction measures on embodied
   energy},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {226},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Annually, 48\% of the global energy is used by buildings in their
   construction, operation, and maintenance, causing significant damage to
   the environment due to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. During
   their life cycles, buildings use energy in the form of embodied energy
   (EE) and operating energy (OE). In a conventional building, EE accounts
   for 10-20\% of a building's life cycle energy (LCE), while OE accounts
   for 80-90\%. As a result, the building sector has taken several measures
   to reduce OE in buildings. These OE reducing measures fail to account
   for the subsequent increase in EE and might cause an increase in the
   building's overall LCE. A systematic review of the literature shows
   limited research that comprehensively evaluates the impact of design
   measures aimed at OE reduction on EE for different construction
   assemblies. In this study, we quantify and compare trade-offs on EE
   demand, caused by OE reduction measures for eight different building
   wall assemblies across four climatic zones within the United States. The
   EE and OE demands of the ASHRAE 90.1-2016 benchmark model and its
   variations were computed using Tally (TM) and Autodesk (R) Green
   Building Studio (R) (GBS), respectively. The results helped us determine
   the EE factor (EE spent per unit of OE savings) for different OE
   reduction measures. Although the calculated EE factors vary across
   different climatic zones and construction assemblies, these factors show
   significant EE costs for different OE reduction measures. This knowledge
   could help inform the design of evolutionary and deep/machine
   learning-based algorithms to assess and optimize building energy use.

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The building sector plays a central role in addressing the problem of
   global energy consumption. Therefore, effective design measures need to
   be taken to ensure efficient usage and management of new structures. The
   challenging task for designers is to reduce energy demands while
   maintaining a high-quality indoor environment and low costs of
   construction and operations. This study proposes a methodological
   framework that enables decision-makers to resolve conflicts between
   energy demand and life cycle costs. A case study is analyzed to validate
   the proposed method, adopting different solutions for walls, roofs,
   floors, windows, window-to-wall ratios and geographical locations.
   Models are created on the basis of all the possible combinations between
   these elements, enriched by their thermal properties and
   construction/management costs. After the alternative models are defined,
   energy analyses are carried out for an estimation of consumption. By
   calculating the total cost of each model as the sum of construction,
   energy and maintenance costs, a joint analysis is carried out for
   variable life cycles. The obtained results from the proposed method
   confirm the importance of a preliminary assessment from both energy and
   cost points of view, and demonstrate the impact of considering different

Abstract = {This presentation highlights multi-faceted decision-making concepts for
   facility design and construction and identifies opportunities for the
   use of a building information model (BIM) for simulating the facility
   lifecycle, from design, through construction and after handoff to the
   owner and occupant. Whether it is the architect, engineer or other team
   member on the project, having the authoritative source provide design
   and functional information into a BIM allows the facility owner to
   better understand how the facility will function prior to construction
   and ensure optimum functionality after occupancy. With a BIM, owners
   will be able to understand the cost of design decisions on operations on
   an annual basis for the life of the facility. A BIM life-cycle-based
   simulation of facilities provides the predictive information necessary
   to profoundly improve the way a facility is built and operated because
   everyone involved in the process can work according to a plan defined
   prior to construction.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology streamlines the
   establishment of systematic methodologies for managing built asset
   information effectively throughout each asset's entire life cycle. The
   recently introduced ISO 19650 series provides standardized processes and
   guidelines to facilitate the efficient management of such information.
   In this context, the ISO standards advocate for using a common data
   environment (CDE), which serves as a centralized repository for
   collecting and managing all graphical and non-graphical construction
   project data for the entire project team. Ideally, a single CDE should
   be utilized and maintained throughout the life cycle of each project.
   However, due to practical and technical challenges, multiple CDEs are
   frequently employed and managed concurrently in actual projects, leading
   to significant issues such as data inconsistencies, duplications, and
   missing information. This paper presents a framework for managing
   multiple CDEs, which enables the preservation of data integrity. The
   proposed framework is anticipated to foster the progression of BIM
   maturity levels in real-world projects.},

Abstract = {Computer simulation for buildings has become affordable and possible in
   both research and industry during the last decades with rapid progress
   of computer industry as well as fundamental advancement of computational
   techniques. This paper provides an overview of such advancements
   achieved between 1987 and 2014, during which Professor Branko Todorovich
   served as Editor in Chief of Energy and Buildings Journal. The review,
   however, was not restricted to this journal only, in order to provide a
   fair snapshot on overall technique advances. Simulation and
   computational techniques cover a variety of aspects of building. This
   paper focuses specifically on six different topics including ventilation
   performance prediction, whole building energy and thermal load
   simulation, lighting and daylighting modeling, building information
   modeling, indoor acoustic simulation, and life cycle analysis of
   buildings. Major advances in each area are highlighted, as well as the
   trends for development and application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) costs in buildings represent a
   significant part of the total building life cycle cost. However, project
   delivery methods in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction
   (AEC) industry are often focused on the capital delivery stage and
   associated costs ranging from planning, through design, to construction
   and handover. Open data standards such as the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) and specifications such as the Construction Operations
   Building information exchange (COBie) provide the capability to capture
   Facilities Management (FM) data requirements in a structured manner from
   the early stages of project development. We aim to investigate how and
   whether IFC and COBie can deliver the data and information about assets
   required by facility managers within a whole life cycle perspective. We
   focus on specific use cases including the creation of asset registers
   and service life planning. However, the methodology adopted can be
   generalised and applied to any other FM use case. The results show that
   IFC, COBie and the tested supporting tools exhibited some shortcomings
   in delivering some of the data entities, types and parameters required
   for the selected FM use cases. We discuss these shortcomings and propose
   them as areas for improvement to domain researchers, standardisation
   bodies and technology providers. Finally, we instigate domain
   researchers to adopt the proposed methodology and conduct further FM use
   cases.},

Abstract = {Information exchange among project stakeholders as part of structural
   life-cycle management has been gaining increasing interest in civil
   engineering. An integral part of structural life-cycle management is the
   operation and maintenance phase of structures, which is frequently
   associated with structural health monitoring ( SHM). SHM has emerged as
   a novel methodology enabling the assessment of structural conditions by
   extracting information from structural response data and environmental
   data collected by sensors attached to structures. Representing a
   paradigm for exchanging information among stakeholders for structural
   life-cycle management, conventional building information, such as
   geometry, material and cost, is structured in so-called ``building
   information models{''}. These models are defined within building
   information modeling ( BIM) standards, such as the Industry Foundation
   Classes ( IFC). Furthermore, in recent research efforts, IFC-compliant
   descriptions of ``monitoring-related information{''}, i. e. information
   on SHM systems, have been reported. However, semantic descriptions of
   algorithms employed for SHM ({''}SHM-related algorithms{''}) have not
   yet received adequate research attention. This paper introduces a
   semantic description approach for modeling and integrating SHM-related
   algorithms into IFC-based building information models. Specifically,
   this study focuses on algorithms embedded into wireless sensor nodes for
   automatically processing SHM data on board. The semantic description
   approach is validated by describing a wireless SHM system installed on a
   laboratory test structure designed and implemented with an embedded
   algorithm ( fast Fourier transform). The expected outcome of this study
   is essentially an extension to the current IFC schema enabling the
   description of SHM-related algorithms in conjunction with SHM systems
   and structures to be monitored.},

Title = {How to evaluate circularity through an LCA study based on the standards
   EN 15804 and EN 15978},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose EN 15804 and EN 15978 are the established standards to calculate
   the environmental impact of building products and buildings. Despite the
   importance of circular building, many life cycle assessment (LCA)
   studies based on EN 15804/15978 are not set up to evaluate circularity.
   This paper aims to research how an LCA study should be developed that
   can determine the environmental impact of a circular versus a linear
   building element within the methodological framework of EN 15804/15978.
   Methods First, it is clarified how the methodological framework of EN
   15804/15978 considers different circular principles. There is a
   particular focus on the concept of multi-cycling and module D. Second,
   and as the main objective of this paper, it is analyzed which scenarios
   throughout the lifespan of a building element should be modeled. The
   focus lies on combining characteristic transformation and end-of-life
   scenarios into characteristic life cycle scenarios and examining if this
   provides sufficient insight into the possible environmental impact. This
   is illustrated by an LCA study of a linear and circular facade system.
   When representing the results of the LCA study, it is analyzed how the
   inclusion of module D changes the results. Results and discussion To
   account for the concept of `multi-cycling,' the authors propose to
   consider multiple use cycles (i.e., transformations) within one life
   cycle instead of considering several life cycles. This is done through
   module B5 Refurbishments. Module D is important to stimulate recycling
   and reuse at the end of life. However, the concept of module D must be
   handled with the necessary care to provide correct information.
   Characteristic life cycle scenarios are determined for a more robust
   understanding of the possible environmental impact of a building element
   by modeling only a limited amount of scenarios. For the facade systems,
   the considered transformation scenarios are more determining for their
   environmental impact than the choice of end-of-life scenario, especially
   when module D is not considered. Conclusions By setting up an LCA study
   that can evaluate the important circular principles and consider
   characteristic life cycle scenarios, detailed insight into the
   environmental impact of circular versus linear building elements can be
   obtained. The proposed approach leads to more robust LCA studies of
   circular versus linear building elements.},

Title = {A circular economy life cycle costing model (CE-LCC) for building
   components},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The building industry is responsible for the highest resource use,
   amount of waste and emissions of all industries. The principles of the
   Circular Economy (CE) could offer an approach to create a more
   sustainable built environment. For a transition towards a circular built
   environment, a comprehensive assessment method is needed to support the
   development of circular building products. As a step towards such a
   method, we developed an economic assessment in the form of a Circular
   Economy Life Cycle Cost (CE-LCC) model. It is based on existing Life
   Cycle Cost techniques and adapted to meet the requirements of CE
   products. The model is developed to (1) consider products as a composite
   of components and parts with different and multiple use cycles, (2)
   include processes that take place after the end of use, (3) provide
   practical and usable information to all stakeholders, and (4) facilitate
   alignment of the functional unit and system boundaries with LCA. To test
   the model, it has been applied to the case of the Circular Kitchen
   (CIK). Three variants of the CIK were compared to each other and the
   `business-as-usual' case to determine which variant is the most
   economically competitive on the long term. The model indicates that the
   most flexible variant of the CIK has the lowest LCC outcome, even when
   considering multiple interest, lifespan and remanufacturing and
   recycling scenarios. Although, the model could benefit from further
   research and application, it can support the transition towards a more
   sustainable (building) industry.},

Abstract = {The problems and effects of global warming stand a primary concern for
   most of the people in today's world. As the demand for energy increases,
   the available energy resources noticeably decrease which rapidly
   upsurges the need for energy-efficient buildings. Housing is one of the
   largest energy consumers as it consumes about 40\% of the total energy.
   This study aims to improve the energy consumption and the strength of
   houses in India compared to other materials in construction walls. The
   study includes the record of electricity life cycle, fuel consumption
   and Life Cycle Energy Costs (LCEC), the intensity of the annual energy
   consumption and the peak value of the annual demand, its evaluation and
   presents the comparison with the original planning. Finally, the measure
   of the total annual energy and total electricity and fuel life cycle
   costs for the building wall in the Indian scenario using sustainable
   energy efficient design and construction methods under BIM and tools
   like Revit, Insight360 and Green Building Studio are presented. An
   energy analysis model that integrates BIM to create precise residential
   performance forecasts with better optimization scenarios is represented.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of the Extent to Which BIM Is Integrated into
   Operation and Maintenance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although a considerable amount of research has addressed the use of
   building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM)
   within the past years, there is limited systematic review on
   investigating the potentials of BIM within the operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) life cycle phase. Yet, this phase could account for approximately
   60\% of the total life cycle costs of assets. The purpose of this paper
   is to conduct a systematic literature review on the application of BIM
   in the O\&M phase to identify current research trends, research gaps and
   future directions. This study achieves the aforementioned purpose by
   adopting the preferred reporting items for systematic review and
   meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P). It employs qualitative and
   quantitative techniques to analyse the articles from a combination of
   three multi-disciplinary research databases, namely-Scopus, Web of
   Science and Engineering Village, which also comprises Compendex, InSpec,
   GeoRef and GeoBase sub-databases. After an in-depth review of 196
   selected journal articles, this study systemically presents: (1)
   bibliometric analyses of the literature in BIM and O \& M; (2) research
   patterns and trends; (3) drivers and barriers to BIM-O\&M integration;
   and (4) research gaps mapped into a standard project management
   lifecycle to guide future research directions. The content analysis
   reveals that BIM has mainly been integrated under seven functions:
   information management (IM), advanced technology (AT), maintenance and
   asset management (MAM), indoor management (IM), performance assessment
   (PA), visualisation (V), and lean management (LM). Findings of the study
   reveal that the UK, USA and China are the top ranked countries with
   regards to research outputs on BIM-O\&M integrations. The majority of
   BIM integrations within O\&M falls under the information management
   function, whereas the least research output was recorded under lean
   management. In addition, the majority of studies focused on
   institutional and infrastructure facility types, but residential,
   industrial and commercial buildings were underrepresented, despite their
   disproportionate physical dominance within most societies. Findings also
   show that potential drivers and barriers for BIM integrations within
   O\&M can be classified into three main categories-technical,
   organisational, and legal/contractual. It is then concluded that the
   application of BIM within O\&M is still emerging, which further
   emphasises the need for more studies that address value realization in
   the context of BIM in O\&M, with particular focus on the specific O\&M
   principles for different building types.},

Abstract = {The recent accelerated development of the information management process
   has assisted to provide further technical development in the
   construction industry. In order to achieve the best sustainable design,
   it is critical to examine the design of construction projects and
   consider all potential alternatives. This problem may become very
   difficult when the choice of alternative depends on the assessment of a
   number of design related criteria. Hence, there is a need for better
   tools and increased use of technology to improve the selection of
   suitable alternative. The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   Value Engineering (VE) can improve sustainable design even further. In
   addition, the use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a fundamental
   approach to decision making. This paper presents a framework integrating
   BIM with VE to improve sustainable design by creating a model designed
   to select the best alternative with several criteria. This model is
   based on the development of a 5D BIM model, studying the energy
   efficiency of building design. Also, assess the relative environmental
   impacts of building materials. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is
   considered through the LEED rating system according to ISO 14040
   standards. The results show that the proposed model has the potential to
   improve the study of VE job plan, and the importance of the model in
   evaluating and selecting the most appropriate alternative design.},

Title = {Evaluating Building Systems Energy Performance Superiority and

Abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for sustainable buildings is increasing. The main
   purpose of buildings is to provide a comfortable living environment for
   their occupants, considering different aspects including thermal,
   visual, and acoustic comfort as well as Indoor Air Quality. Decreasing
   carbon footprint and energy consumption rates while increasing comfort
   level can help to achieve better living and working environment for
   building users. This research proposes a framework that aims at
   improving building system energy performance using building information
   modeling (BIM) during buildings' design stage by evaluating different
   alternatives for installed building systems. According to experts'
   opinions, evaluating buildings' energy performance by analyzing the
   energy consumption rates alone without including economic and
   environmental factors is insufficient. Therefore, in this paper,
   building systems are evaluated using four main criteria; operating cost
   savings, total energy consumption per year, Lifecycle cost savings, and
   carbon emissions. A Multiple Criteria Decision-making (MCDM) technique
   is applied using Superiority and Inferiority Ranking (SIR) to study the
   behavior of different alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is performed to
   detect the criticality and effectiveness of the different defined
   criteria that influence environmental concerns and building system
   energy performance. A case study is presented to demonstrate the use of
   the proposed framework on an academic building by considering four
   criteria which are Operating Costs, Life Cycle Cost, Energy Consumption,
   and Carbon Emissions. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the weights
   of the criteria to determine how critical each criterion is and how they
   affect the ranking of the alternatives. A total of 36 combinations are
   simulated, considering changing the weights and procedure (SAW vs.
   TOPSIS). The rank that has the top repetitive percentage is considered
   to identify the most dominating alternative.},

Abstract = {Holistic views of all environmental impacts for buildings such as Life
   Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are rarely performed. Building services are
   mostly included in this assessment only in a simplified way, which means
   that their embodied impacts are usually underestimated. Open Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provide
   for significantly more efficient and comprehensive LCA performance. This
   study investigated how building services can be included in an open
   BIM-integrated whole-building LCA for the first time, identified
   challenges and showed six solution approaches. Based on the definition
   of 222 exchange requirements and their mapping with IFC, an example BIM
   model was modeled before the linking of 7312 BIM objects of building
   services with LCA data that were analyzed in an LCA tool. The results
   show that 94.5\% of the BIM objects could only be linked by applying one
   of the six solution approaches. The main problems were due to: (1)
   modeling by a lack of standardization of attributes of BIM objects; (2)
   difficult machine readability of the building services LCA datasets as
   well as a general lack of these; and (3) non-standardized properties of
   building services and LCA specific dataset information in the IFC data
   format.},

Title = {BIM and LCA integration methodologies: A critical analysis and proposed
   guidelines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {73},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {There is growing concern about mitigating the environmental impacts of
   the construction industry. In this context, research has increasingly
   sought methods to integrate life cycle assessment (LCA) with building
   information modeling (BIM) to enhance the management of information in
   the development process of engineering projects and to increase the
   environmental performance of buildings. Despite the importance and
   urgency of the theme, this research finds that publications on the
   subject are mostly recent and that 70\% of all publications were
   published between 2020 and 2022. In this context, there is a need for
   greater standardization in the research to be produced on the subject
   with regard to best practices and conclusions, thus enabling a better
   comparison between them to direct the best paths to be adopted by the
   construction industry. Although there are review articles highlighting
   the challenges and opportunities involved in the use of integrated BIM
   and LCA (BIM-LCA) methodologies, the choice of reference article for
   adoption is often hampered by the absence of a conceptual and
   methodological framework. The purpose of this article is to perform a
   systematic review based on the ProKnow-C methodology, perform critical
   analysis and present guidelines for the preparation of BIM-LCA articles.
   A total of 75 studies, 13 reviews and 62 original articles, are
   selected, and it is found that there are gaps and challenges in the
   implementation of BIM-LCA methodologies in the construction industry to
   be explored. The production of standardized articles that present
   consolidated and adequately presented best practices will enable the
   construction of a relevant benchmark to reduce subjectivity in decision
   making in regard to the design and development of engineering projects
   and in the execution of constructions, increasing environmental
   performance.},

Abstract = {At present, an increasing number of researchers and specialists in the
   construction industry come to the opinion that it is advisable to use a
   number of technologies (BIM, Smart City, Big Data, IOT and others) in
   the practice of construction (in the broad sense of this concept), which
   are united by the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The
   result of the implementation of these technologies in the construction
   should be the transition to the widespread use of cyber-physical
   systems.
   The problem of using information technologies in construction today is
   not due to the lack of this process as such, but to the lack of
   consistency and consistency in it. Fragmentary nature of the
   application, inconsistency of the applied technologies at different
   levels of management and at different stages of the life cycle of
   construction projects sharply reduce the potential positive effect of
   informatization and building automation. At the same time, the concept
   of cyber-physical systems, that is, the integration at the system level
   of physical processes and controls has proven effective in industrial
   production.
   The approaches to ensuring the processes of designing cyber-physical
   building systems through the development and application of General
   mathematical models for the processes of data exchange and management
   are considered. The presented models of data exchange and management of
   cyber-physical building systems describe the processes implemented at
   each stage of the life cycle of cyber-physical building systems.
   Functional blocks of the considered models allow to describe the
   processes of data collection, storage and processing on the current and
   past stages of the life cycle of cyber-physical construction systems.
   The presented models are the elements of mathematical support of the
   processes of designing cyber-physical building systems, which determine
   the processes of information exchange and management between the
   structures of cyber-physical building systems of different levels of
   hierarchy in the full life cycle.},

Abstract = {Purpose Because the construction industry is one of the largest waste
   producers, understanding the primary reasons for waste production is
   essential. The goal of this study is to identify the major causes of
   waste production over the project life cycle in Iran's construction
   industry and to propose effective solutions based on modern technologies
   like BIM. Design/methodology/approach After identifying the primary
   causes of construction and demolition waste production through
   interviews and literature analysis, solutions based on building
   information modeling (BIM) were provided. Then, using questionnaires and
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the areas impacting waste reduction
   were found. Findings The findings suggest that ``prefabrication{''} is
   the best approach for improving time and quality, while ``detection and
   prediction of errors in the design and construction phases{''} is the
   most cost-effective technique for addressing cost and environmental
   issues. Originality/value Cost, time, quality and environmental concerns
   may all be influenced by effective waste management throughout the
   project life cycle. Furthermore, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies
   has far-reaching implications for reducing material waste, resulting in
   more environmental-friendly construction.},

   comparative case study of stochastic approaches},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {121-131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment of buildings has become popular recently, due to
   the significant potential of emission reduction. Previous studies have
   contributed much to the quantification of emissions, yet the issue of
   uncertainties needs to be further investigated. In general, the
   uncertainty in life cycle assessment is mainly due to the errors in
   input parameters, definition of system boundary and scenario
   assumptions, and choice of analytical models, which could be summarized
   as parameter, scenario, and model uncertainties. In the present study,
   data quality indicators were adopted and a semi-quantitative method was
   modeled accordingly, relevant to the uncertainty analysis of building
   emission assessment. A case study building was analyzed comparing the
   deterministic and stochastic approaches, and the results indicate that
   the uncertainty in input parameters could result in a standard deviation
   of 3106 tCO(2e) for the sample mean of 61504 tCO(2e), which is in line
   with the deterministic results. Further scenario analyses investigated
   the influence of scenario and modelling alternatives. Relevant results
   emphasized the definition of system boundary and energy efficiency to
   control uncertainties, and suggested applying statistical distribution
   for key parameters in analysis. Overall, the present study could provide
   useful information on the uncertainty of life cycle emission assessment,
   and, therefore, be helpful in decision-making regarding the low-carbon
   development of building industry.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon
   emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural
   design decisions play a critical role in a building's carbon footprint,
   making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various
   design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building
   information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon
   architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of
   a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach
   to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It
   combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and
   building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies
   present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first
   case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating
   carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon
   footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use
   of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest
   optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions
   made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the
   form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a
   comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in
   enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.},

Abstract = {The digital revolution in industry, buildings, and the Internet of
   Things will massively increase the number of sensor, actuator, and
   control devices in the near future. This will lead to the further
   automation of many tasks in the life cycle of the systems from design to
   commissioning and operation. Device and system models are a key enabler
   in this goal as they provide a holistic information pool that can be
   utilized by various tools and users along the life cycle. This paper
   analyzes the current state of the art of device and system models. It
   looks across different domains from industrial automation to building
   automation and sensor networks, defines the common tasks in their life
   cycle, and classifies the information required to execute and automate
   them. It compares 24 common device modeling approaches against these
   requirements and unveils how ready they are for the future and what they
   lack. Index Terms-Building automation (BA), commissioning,},

Title = {Integration of 3DGIS and BIM and its application in visual detection of

Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The multi-level modeling technology of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), combined with Three-dimensional Geographic Information System
   (3DGIS) macro-scene visualization technology and location information,
   can realize the transmission of decentralized information from various
   disciplines to multi-disciplinary collaborative information sharing
   services. It can be applied independently for the whole life cycle,
   which plays a positive role in reducing the cost and improving the
   efficiency of engineering planning, design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance. In this paper, the data integration and function
   integration methods of 3DGIS and BIM are designed. In order to avoid the
   breaking problems caused by attribute information loss and excessive
   simplification in the process of BIM data integration, the attribute
   mapping between 3DGIS and BIM based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) and the data simplification
   method considering the geometric characteristics of BIM are designed. By
   setting the relevant preconditions and thresholds of patch merging, on
   the premise of maintaining the structural characteristics of BIM data
   surface, reduce the amount of model data to improve the efficiency of
   BIM data loading, rendering and display effect in 3D geospatial scene.
   Through the data and function integration of 3DGIS and BIM, we can
   effectively manage the data of large-scale model, and calculate and
   obtain the geospatial location and direction of key parts of buildings
   through the coordinate transformation of BIM, which can effectively
   assist the rapid and accurate positioning of BIM in virtual 3D scene and
   expand the visualization ability of 3DGIS. By effectively integrating
   3DGIS and BIM, this paper gives full play to the spatial management
   advantages of 3DGIS and the component management advantages of BIM. The
   rationality and operability of the method are verified by its
   application in the operation and maintenance management project of
   concealed facilities in actual buildings.},

Abstract = {The construction of smart cities in our country has received extensive
   attention. Under the situation that smart cities are vigorously promoted
   nowadays, compared with traditional construction and operation and
   maintenance methods, building information model (BIM) technology is more
   suitable to serve as an important foundation for intelligent management
   in the whole process of construction projects. BIM is an abbreviation
   for building information model. BIM relies on a variety of digital
   technologies, which can be used to realize information modeling of urban
   buildings and infrastructure. The efficiency of information exchange in
   the process of intelligence construction ensures the integrity and
   accuracy of information data exchange and maintains the consistency of
   information data exchange. Data and information have objectivity,
   applicability, transferability, and sharing. Geographic data is a
   digital representation of various geographical features and phenomena
   and their relationships. BIM is a digital representation of physical and

Abstract = {This research aims to bridge the information gap pertaining to the
   utilization of building information modeling (BIM) in steel building
   projects. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted
   to synthesize the available uses. This research involved three
   phases-planning, execution, and reporting-according to the PRISMA guide,
   which includes the main aspects of identification, screening, and
   eligibility. As a result of the SLR, it is evident how and where BIM
   facilitates steel building projects, which were grouped into three
   different categories according to their main BIM topics. One of the uses
   that stands out as a common denominator across the different processes
   is ``early integration{''}. Early integration allows for optimization of
   the design based on existing resources, directly affecting the cost and
   time of steel building projects in a positive manner.},

Abstract = {Construction emissions have become a major concern that has risen
   extensively in the last few decades. This paper introduces a building
   information modeling (BIM)-based model to evaluate the environmental and
   economic consequences of different project alternatives. The model
   calculates direct, indirect emissions and primary energy for the overall
   project life cycle. A hybrid fuzzy multi-objective non-dominated sorting
   genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) problem is designed to model the
   uncertainties associated with the quantification of the judging
   attributes, and consequently to find the most sustainable materials by
   minimizing the objective functions; project duration, project life cycle
   cost, project overall emissions and total project primary energy.
   Finally, TOPSIS is applied to select the most sustainable material for
   each construction component among the set of Pareto optimal solutions. A
   case study of an academic building in Saudi Arabia is presented in order
   to exemplify the practical features of the proposed model. (C) 2020 by

Title = {Transition from building information modeling (BIM) to integrated
   digital delivery (IDD) in sustainable building management: A knowledge
   discovery approach based review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {291},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, building information modeling (BIM) and
   sustainability have attracted increased interest, with a concomitant
   rise in the number of related publications. However, research efforts
   made in BIM for sustainable building management, especially using in all
   four Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) phases are minimal. Therefore,
   this study features a combined scientometric analysis and IDD thematic
   discussion examining 471 scholarly bibliographies accessed from the Web
   of Science (WoS) database. The purpose of this study is to statistically
   classify BIM-sustainability publications from 2007 to 2019 in order to
   understand the research status, key themes, trends, and future
   challenges to be addressed in the field of sustainable BIM. The most
   influential scholars, institutes, regions/countries, articles, and
   journals have been identified. Moreover, clustering analyses identified
   topics that sustainable BIM research tended to gravitate toward, such as
   cloud approaches, data sharing, life cycle energy efficiency, and
   informetric analysis. The top 100 most cited documents from WoS were
   also manually classified into four quadrants of IDD, namely design,
   fabrication, construction, and asset delivery and management. Ten
   BIMsustainability phenomena were observed throughout the life cycle of
   IDD. Finally, key research gaps and important areas for future research
   in this field were identified. The clearly delineated clusters and
   themes provide a practical overview and a deeper understanding of the
   current research progress of IDD for building sustainability,
   highlighting the challenges and research gaps for future research.

Abstract = {The continuous developments of Building Information Modelling.(BIM) in
   Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry supported by
   the advancements in material resourcing and construction processes could
   offer engineers the essential decision-making procedures to leverage the
   raising demands for sustainable structural designs. This article brings
   together the theory of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the capabilities
   of BIM to survey the current developments in the energy efficiency of
   structural systems. In addition, the article explores the engineering
   dimensions of common decision-making procedures within BIM systems
   including optimisation methods, buildability and safety constraints and
   code compliance limitations. The research presents critical expositions
   in both engineering and sustainable energy domains. The article then
   argues that future innovations in the sustainable decision making of
   buildings' structures would require BIM-integrated workflows in order to
   facilitate the conflicting nature of both energy efficient and
   engineering performance indexes. Finally, the study puts forward a
   series of research guidelines for a consolidated decision paradigm that
   utilises the capabilities of BIM within the engineering and sustainable
   energy domains in a synergistic manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {From LCA to circular design: A comparative study of digital tools for
   the built environment},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {200},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper reviews digital tools for supporting the Circular Economy
   (CE) in the built environment. The study provides a bibliometric
   analysis and focuses on computer-aided design (CAD), building
   information modeling (BIM), and computational plugins that can be used
   by practitioners. While Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the primary
   methodology for evaluating buildings' environmental performance, the
   study identifies tools beyond LCA, including computational methods and
   circularity indicators, that can support the evaluation of circular
   design strategies. Our review highlights limitations in tools'
   functionalities, including a lack of representative data for LCA and
   underdeveloped circularity indicators. The paper calls for further
   development of these tools in terms of interoperability aspects,
   integration of more sources of data for LCA and circularity, and
   possibilities for a comprehensive evaluation of design choices.
   Computational plugins offer greater flexibility, while BIM-LCA
   integrations have the potential to replace dedicated LCA software and
   spreadsheets. Additionally, the study identifies opportunities for novel
   digital methods, such as algorithms for circular design with various
   types of reused building elements, and sharing of digital twins and
   material passports. This research can inform future studies and support
   architects and engineers in their efforts to create a sustainable built
   environment.},

Title = {A spatio-temporal life cycle assessment framework for building
   renovation scenarios at the urban scale},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption of buildings is a priority for carbon
   emissions mitigation in urban areas. Building stock energy models have
   been developed to support decisions of public authorities in renovation
   strategies. However, the burdens of renovation interventions and their
   temporal distribution are mostly overlooked, leading to potential
   overestimation of environmental benefits. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   provides a holistic estimation of environmental impacts, but further
   developments are needed to correctly consider spatio-temporal aspects.
   We propose a spatio-temporal LCA framework to assess renovation
   scenarios of urban housing stocks, integrating: 1) a geospatial
   building-by-building stock model, 2) energy demand modelling, 3)
   product-based LCA, and 4) a scenario generator. Temporal aspects are
   considered both in the lifecycle inventory and the lifecycle impact
   assessment phases, by accounting for the evolution of the existing
   housing stock and applying time-adjusted carbon footprint calculation.
   We apply the framework for the carbon footprint assessment of housing
   renovation in Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg). Results show that the
   renovation stage represents 4\%-16\% of the carbon footprint in the
   residual service life of existing buildings, respectively after
   conventional or advanced renovations. Under current renovation rates,
   the carbon footprint reduction would be limited to 3-4\% by 2030.
   Pushing renovation rates to 3\%, enables carbon reductions up to 28\% by
   2030 when combined with advanced renovations. Carbon reductions in the
   operational stage of buildings are offset by 8-9\% due to the impacts of
   renovation. Using time-adjusted emissions results in higher weight for
   the renovation stage and slightly lower benefits for renovation.},

Abstract = {Emerging information and communication technologies like building
   information modeling, internet of things, social networking, cloud
   computing, big data analytics, mobile application and so on serve as
   important catalysts to transform the practices of infrastructure asset
   management (IAM). Owners, occupiers, managers, operators and contractors
   of infrastructure facilities can now capture, process, share, integrate,
   and analyze data related to various infrastructure facilities
   collaboratively and cooperatively to achieve an integrated whole life
   cycle IAM. This should help improve the overall efficiency of a
   community and/or city through optimized resource allocation; reduced
   maintenance and refurbishment cost; less energy consumption; lower risks
   of service disruption; increased transparency; and better strategic,
   tactical and operational decisions. This paper outlines the development
   of a social networking enabled crowdsourcing system for integrated IAM.
   The system is designed to satisfy the requirements of different
   stakeholders in managing, operating and repairing a series of
   interdependent infrastructure facilities. Preliminary studies on the
   residential sector of Hong Kong reveal that the system could help
   improve the communication between stakeholders, enhance the transparency
   and effectiveness of asset management, and reduce the risks of
   bidrigging in the repair and maintenance schemes. By integrating the
   proposed system with the existing systems being adopted throughout the
   entire building life cycle, such as the building information modeling
   and asset management systems, facility condition, and usage data that is
   difficult to obtain through traditional means can now be crowdsourced,
   co-created, or co-processed for facility performance analysis, complaint
   analysis, and service scheduling analysis.},

Abstract = {This article provides a picture of the latest developments in providing
   BIM-based tools for construction and demolition waste (CDW) management.
   The coverage and breadth of the literature on offering BIM-based tools
   and technologies for dealing with CDW throughout the whole life cycle of
   construction are investigated, and gaps are identified. Findings reveal
   that, although various BIM-based technologies are closely associated
   with CDW, much of the existing research on this area has focused on the
   design and construction phase; indeed, the problem of CDW in
   post-construction stages has received scant attention. Besides, the now
   available tools and technologies are lacking in cross-phase insights
   into project waste aspects and are weak in theoretical rigor. This
   article contributes to the field by identifying the intellectual
   deficiencies in offering BIM-based tools and technologies when dealing
   with CDW. So, too, it points to major priorities for future research on
   the topic. For practitioners, the study provides a point of reference
   and raises awareness in the field about the most advanced available
   BIM-based technologies for dealing with CDW problems.},

Abstract = {The concept of Smart city includes creating eco-friendly, safe,
   energy-saving and comfortable human environment. New principles of Smart
   city management are based on the processing of the information about its
   status and about functioning of its elements. One of the important
   elements of the environment are buildings. Modern state of construction
   engineering is characterized by the transition to BIM technology.
   Accordingly, the information about the building is represented as its
   information model. In Russia great attention is given to the research of
   the effective application of information models throughout the whole
   life cycle of the construction object. During the process of design,
   construction and operation of the building there is a need of
   extraction, analysis and transmission of the data that is stored in the
   information model. The same problem occurs during the operational
   management of life support systems of the building. In this paper there
   is a classification of methods for extracting and processing of the
   building information model data by means of software Revit. The methods
   of data processing on the basis of internal software instruments are
   described. The transmission of data to specialized programs, which allow
   to analyze the parameters of the building, is discussed. The experience
   of analyzing the building information model for solving various
   specialized problems is described. Special attention is paid for
   extracting and analyzing data by developing additional software modules.
   The method of writing a macro within Revit project by using a built-in
   C\# code editor is presented. An example of a plugin to create the
   dll-library for Revit in Visual Studio environment is given. The
   opportunities of data processing with the help of software Dynamo are
   analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of various approaches are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess electric heating system retrofit options and
   identify the optimal solution by applying a combined LCA and LCCA
   approach using BIM for existing UK homes. Exemplary case study
   illustrating an LCA and LCCA calculation using a BIM model of a house in
   Bristol (UK), to assess: (baseline) gas boiler; (i) electric boiler;
   (ii) air source heat pump; (iii) electric boiler + PV; and (iv) ASHP +
   PV. The optimal option overall is (iv) ASHP + PV, which reduces the
   kgCO2e emitted by 77\% while increasing lifetime cost by 2.1\%, compared
   to the classic gas boiler. This research also finds that embodied carbon
   still has a low impact on the decision, since the main impact of heating
   systems like ASHP (SCOP = 3.4) is to reduce kgCO2e by improving the
   efficiency of old gas boilers (COP = 0.76). Electric boilers are not the
   optimal alternative; they reduce kgCO2e by 47\% but increase the
   lifetime cost of the system by 105\% compared to gas boilers. The change
   in the ``carbon factor{''} of electricity from 0.519 kgCO2/kWh to 0.136
   kgCO2/kWh means that now dwellings using electrical systems emit 35\%
   less kgCO2 than those that use gas (0.210 kgCO2/kWh).(c) 2023 The

Abstract = {The research deals with reconstruction projects investigation by
   applying statistical analysis and multiple criteria decision-making
   method, also research on application of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) methodology for reconstruction projects. The implementation of
   reconstruction projects face a lot of problems, and the list of problems
   is identified when analyzing Lithuanian case studies. The analysis shows
   that it is necessary to monitor design, construction and maintenance
   stages both for quality control and information management during the
   whole project life cycle. According to suggested problem recognition
   methodology, the list of problems is analyzed in terms of occurrence in
   the projects and influence to the project. The complex solution is based
   on estimated problems significance as a result of statistical survey and
   expert survey by applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology.
   Possible BIM uses for reconstruction projects are suggested to prevent
   the identified problems. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The concept of a digital twin has been used in some industries where an
   accurate digital model of the equipment can be used for predictive
   maintenance. The use of a digital twin for performance is critical, and
   for capital-intensive equipment such as jet engines it proved to be
   successful in terms of cost savings and reliability improvements. In
   this paper, we aim to study the expansion of the digital twin in
   including building life cycle management and explore the benefits and
   shortcomings of such implementation. In four rounds of experimentation,
   more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and
   utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building
   facade element. This is performed to point out the method of
   implementation, highlight the benefits gained from digital twin, and to
   uncover some of the technical shortcomings of the current Internet of
   Things systems for this purpose.},

Abstract = {Industrial buildings demand higher amount of energy than other building
   typologies, thus powerful modelling and simulation tools for
   energy-optimisation and identification of synergies-potentials between
   the building envelope, building services and production systems are
   needed.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM), as emerging technology, bears
   promise to support processes integration thus enabling life-cycle
   management of buildings. BIM model serves as a joint knowledge database
   where data transfer between various models is possible; thereby enabling
   follow up studies, such as cost, thermal and structural analysis.
   Adoption of BIM to BEM (building energy modelling) approach is
   particularly interesting for optimisation of industrial facilities.
   Multiple layers of interacting complex systems (building, services and
   machine floor layout) require careful modelling and control of geometry
   in terms of collisions, various adaptions due to the short
   product-life-cycles, as well as integrated energy performance analysis
   along interacting systems.
   This paper explores the potentials and deficits of the modelling,
   analysis and optimisation of energy efficient industrial buildings using
   BIM to BEM methodology, by means of case study research of two
   industrial facilities. Varying needs concerning the Level of Development
   and semantic differences in the modelling procedures of part-taking
   disciplines (architecture, structural engineering or analysis) were
   identified as problems; as well as time pressure as one of the main
   reasons for defects of building models. The identified deficits
   represent various types of uncertainties related to the integrated
   energy modelling, as BIM to BEM can be referred to. We conclude that as
   a first step of integrated modelling, an uncertainty-analysis should be
   carried out, and strategies how to deal with these developed. In order
   to minimise BIM to BEM uncertainties, not only interoperability issues
   of the software has to be improved (modelling uncertainty), but
   moreover, the redefinition of the design process and enhancement of
   individual capabilities is necessary (process uncertainty). (C) 2016

Title = {Life cycle assessment of building demolition waste based on building
   information modeling},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sustainable building-demolition-waste management has become an important
   practice. Normally, three different methods of disposing of demolition
   waste should be considered: landfill, reuse, and recycling. The use of
   traditional documentation techniques for assessing the environmental
   impact of different disposal methods during the end-of-life (EOL) stage
   results in hundreds of detailed instruction sheets that need to be
   stored. In this study, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) framework is
   proposed for the evaluation and comparison of the environmental impacts
   of the three disposal strategies mentioned above in terms of factors
   such as the extraction of resources, loss of biodiversity, and effect on
   human health by using the information obtained with typical building
   information modeling (BIM). In the LCA framework, four
   environmental-impact-allocation types (namely, no, equal, mass, and
   economic allocations) are used to calculate the final impacts of the
   products to be shared by more than one product system. The results
   reveal that a particular disposal strategy should be investigated by
   considering an entire building to assess the effective reuse/recycling
   potential. In addition, a BIM-based plug-in (BIM-EF) is developed for
   the automatic appraisal of the environmental impact of buildings at the
   EOL stage by using Revit Add-in Manager. Two data libraries (the
   engineering quantity data library and environmental impact factor
   library) are created, and a coding system is established to connect the
   information stored in the BIM model and the two data libraries. Finally,
   the results of a case study are presented to illustrate the potential
   applications of the proposed method.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {This publication presents the results of applying Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) methods to the entire residential building stock of Germany's
   third largest city, the City of Munich. The focus of the LCA is on the
   technical components of the building heating system. For the analysis,
   we use our developed tool urbi+, which takes 3D city models in the
   CityGML standard enriched with building specific information as input
   parameters. Thus, we investigate both the status quo of Munichs'
   building stock and two different development scenarios with the goal of
   climate neutrality by the year 2035. Development scenario 1 focuses on
   the use of heat pumps and scenario 2 on the expansion of the district
   heating network. The year 2035 has been defined by the City of Munich as
   the official goal for achieving climate neutrality. Within the scope of
   the assessment, we address the parameters of energy demand, greenhouse
   gas emissions and costs. The results show a multidimensional assessment
   space between these parameters and how ambitious it is to achieve the
   goal of climate neutrality by 2035. The results are intended to help
   political and urban planning decision-makers validate climate targets
   and make informed decisions about measures to achieve climate
   neutrality.},

Title = {An integrated life cycle assessment of different facade systems for a
   typical residential building in Ghana},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study performs a comparative environmental and economic assessment
   of four different facade systems for low-cost residential buildings in
   Ghana. A framework is designed to incorporate BIM, Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) to perform a holistic comparison of a
   Shotcrete Insulated Composite Facade (Shotcrete ICF), Galvanised Steel
   Insulated Composite facade (G. Steel ICF) and Stabilised Earth Block
   Facade (SEBF) against the conventional Concrete Block and Mortar Facade
   (CBMF). BIM models are developed to compute the environmental and
   economic impacts of each facade. The results are then subjected to a
   comparative analysis for different life cycle stages. The SEBF is proved
   to be the most sustainable facade as it reduces cumulative energy demand
   (CED) by 39.13 \%, global warming potential (GWP) by 18.07 \% and LCC by
   47.87 \% compared to CBMF. The Shotcrete IFC and G. Steel IFC are found
   to increase CED but decrease GWP. Other than the SEBF, the ranking of
   all facades under different indicators changes through the scenario
   analysis. The findings of this study provide useful guidelines for
   selecting facade systems and reducing the environmental and economic
   impacts of low-cost residential buildings in Ghana.},

Title = {Measuring the environmental impact of IT/IS solutions - A life cycle
   impact modelling approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {94-104},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The academic community has already taken notice of the interactions
   between information technologies (IT), information systems (IS),
   business organizations and the environment. Despite the interest
   garnered, research and modelling approaches on the environmental impact
   of IT/IS are usually explored only through qualitative approaches. This
   paper introduces a way for researchers and practitioners to engage with
   the environmental impact of IT/IS in a more quantitative manner using
   flow based life cycle assessments (LCA). Distinct from other life cycle
   assessment studies, this research paper confirms that integration of
   information flows within life cycle inventory analysis can be both
   useful and viable. Our work presents a conceptual framework for
   flow-based LCA within the context of IT/IS consisting of possibilities
   for defining functional units, a meta model for building symbiotic
   inventory models, the use of established software tools and databases as
   well as concrete actions to apply our framework within simulation
   studies. We hope that better knowledge of the environmental impact of
   IT/IS solutions will facilitate an effort for more sustainable
   solutions. The framework was derived by literature review, design
   science research and evaluated via a simulation. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   Thermal and Environmental Assessment on BIM-Based LCA},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The study conducts a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of
   precast sandwich panels by integrating operational and embodied phases
   detailing thermal efficiency and environmental impacts. The analytical
   regression model is developed for climatic diversity and design
   variables using the energy rating tool FirstRate5 to compare with a
   conventional brick veneer construction. LCA is performed on the building
   information modeling (BIM) platform to connect operational energy and
   express the relative embodied impacts of insulation constituents,
   compressive strength, reinforcement, and mix design. Monte Carlo
   simulation shows significant advantages of concrete sandwich panels in
   reducing operational H/C loads over building service life. LCA reveals a
   100 mm thick external precast concrete wall with 50\% fly ash reduces
   CO2 emission and energy demand by 54.7\% and 75.9\% consecutively
   against the benchmark. Moreover, it comprises 84.31\% of the total
   building mass, accountable for only 53.27\% of total CO2 emission and
   27.25\% of energy demand, which is comparatively lower than other
   materials. In the case of selecting lining insulation, a broader benefit
   is identified for extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene
   (EPS) boards due to their relative weight, thickness, and environmental
   impacts. Representative equations of energy efficiency and impact
   assessment will assist in adopting sandwich panels for new construction
   and refurbishment with relative dimensions.},

Journal = {HABITAT INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {53},
Pages = {292-300},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A novel embodied carbon prediction tool has been developed for
   conventionally constructed housing units. Single and double storey
   terraced, semi-detached and detached housing projects were evaluated by
   adoption of partial life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. The
   statistical technique of multivariable regression analysis was merged
   with LCA and building information modeling (BIM) for prediction of such
   environmental issue in housing sector. The assessment was limited to
   pre-use phase with LCA boundary of ``cradle to site{''}. The criteria
   and requirements for a statistically consistent and efficient prediction
   tool were successfully satisfied with an acceptable average prediction
   error of less than 5\%. Based on very basic explanatory variables, the
   tool also helped to manage the barrier of huge data requirements for
   such environmental studies. The study is expected to act as a milestone
   and help the researchers and industry professionals for quick, effective
   and sustainable environmental assessment, decision making and solutions.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {430},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {This study aims to conduct a scientometric analysis to identify emerging
   trends in waste management strategies over the last three decades
   (1994-2003, 2004-2013, and 2014-2023). Integrated application of
   bibliometric analysis (VOSviewer) and Science Mapping Analysis Tool
   (SciMAT) facilitates the tracing pattern of potential research themes,
   influential authors, significant outcomes, and relevant contributing
   factors over this specified period. Four prominent themes of the
   strategic diagram: (1) Management Systems, (2) Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), (3) Polymer, and (4) Eco-Neighbourhood have been
   revealed for further exploration and improvement. Clustering algorithms
   categorize the principle theme into further sub-components of resource
   recycling, project or building life cycle, energy analysis,
   environmental cost, waste plastic, geopolymer, and others to provide a
   nuanced understanding of interconnected themes. A pragmatic application
   of this analysis minimizes waste generation, optimizes resource
   recovery, and mitigates waste disposal's environmental impacts and
   health consequences. This review article's evidence-based framework
   assesses research dynamics, highlights potential sectors for
   exploration, and encourages innovation and collaboration among
   policymakers and the scientific community to facilitate informed and
   sustainable decision-making. However, valuable insights from alternative
   sources such as technical reports and non-English scholarly articles
   have not been considered for achieving practical applications.},

Title = {An investigation of the impact of building orientation on energy
   consumption in a domestic building using emerging BIM (Building
   Information Modelling)},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {517-527},

Abstract = {BIM (building information modelling) has developed into a powerful
   solution that can improve many aspects of construction industry. Current
   research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy
   needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the
   impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction,
   and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods
   adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using
   Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building
   Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building
   Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the
   Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and
   their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on
   the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different
   orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a
   considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a
   total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use
   difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of 878
   pound throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180 degrees) and
   worst (+45 degrees) orientations of the building was achieved. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) and the digital exchange of
   information in the construction industry is growing rapidly. Objects and
   their information are being exchanged throughout the supply chain and
   throughout the lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur.
   Information is defined and interpreted differently by the different
   parties. Automated exchange of information in the industry is therefore
   not possible. The Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide
   national cooperation between partners in the total building sector, took
   the initiative to develop a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL)(1): ``one
   language for the building sector{''}. Based on the concept of
   ``distributed libraries{''}, the library is mapped to other
   international and national libraries and classification systems. The
   CB-NL is an open standard, beneficial for all partners: More efficient
   exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire
   supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer's
   design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures
   arising from misinterpretation. Many national and international
   standards are mapped to the CB-NL by now. This paper describes the CB-NL
   and covers some practical experiences.},

Title = {ANALYSIS OF 5D BIM FOR COST ESTIMATION, COST CONTROL, AND PAYMENTS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {525-548},
Abstract = {Increasing expectancy for efficiency in the delivery of building
   projects and the adoption of lean production processes for construction
   has made the necessity for the development of an integrated system for
   cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and payments in the
   construction lifecycle important. Existing 5D BIM tools are used to
   estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There
   is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress
   monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of
   standardization in the use of model elements through the project
   lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting
   automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated
   by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of
   building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost
   estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an
   integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This
   paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated
   practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost
   estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the
   construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists
   today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not
   interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized
   classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI
   and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and
   payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case
   study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined.
   According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of
   a cost estimation project. It was also revealed that 5D BIM improves
   project cost visualization and budget control.},

Abstract = {As a special kind of Product Life cyle Management (PLM), Building Life
   cycle Management (BLM) is a centric activity for facility owners and
   managers. This fact motivates the adoption of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) approaches as a way to achieve smart BLM strategies for
   cost reduction, facility knowledge management, and project
   synchronization among the different stakeholders. Unfortunately, the
   current BIM state of the art is tailored towards the management of new
   projects, while ongoing and completed AEC projects could hugely benefit
   from BIM integration for better BLM strategies. In this regards, it is
   absolutely necessary to acquire knowledge about the dynamic facility
   aspects (crowd movement, as-is updates, etc.). Up-to-date, 3D capture
   appears to be the only reliable way to cope with such situation. In this
   paper, we analyze 3D capture techniques, ranging from photogrammetry to
   3D scanning, with an emphasis on helping 3D capture practitioners to
   make critical decisions about the choice of adequate acquisition
   technologies for a particular application. We discuss 3D capture
   techniques by exposing their pros and cons, according to several
   relevant criteria, and synthesize our analysis by developing a set of
   recommendations to enhance the life expectancy of buildings via the
   integration of BIM into Life Cycle Management (LCM) of the built
   environment and its buildings.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that the operational energy and the embodied energy
   caused by production of building materials off-site (i.e.,
   ``cradle-to-gate{''} embodied energy) contribute to the major part of a
   building's total energy use, with roughly equal proportions. In
   addition, it has been reported that there is a trade-off between
   embodied-and operational energy which is mainly due to the use of
   additional materials with higher embodied energy and utilization of new
   appliances for construction of the building (or building of interest).
   Hence, application of sustainable strategies in early stages of the
   design phase, which enables evaluation of different design scenarios in
   terms of materials and systems, can provide a great scope to launch an
   optimization in the trade-off between embodied-versus operational
   energy. With respect to early stages of the design phase, Building
   information modeling (BIM) has become an applicable platform where its
   recent developments can provide interoperability with energy performance
   simulation (EPS) tools that enable assessment of the operational energy.
   However, existing BIM software generally lacks interoperability with
   conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) tools that are the main means
   for assessment of the embodied energy. Consequently, embodied energy
   assessment is often performed when the design has either been
   accomplished or developed to a relatively detailed level where there is
   less scope to investigate different design decisions for analyzing the
   trade-off between embodied-and operational energy. To overcome this
   obstacle, this paper presents a BIM-based method which strives to reduce
   the building's life cycle energy (LCE) use by accounting the trade-off
   between embodied-and operational energy at early stages of the design
   phase. The method is then exemplified by using an energy-efficient
   building case, demonstrating the applicability of the method in reducing
   the building's total energy use and also highlighting the areas where
   further development is required to address in future research.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study aims to design a BIM integration model for steel building
   projects (BIM-DFE). It was developed in the following three phases: (i)
   theoretical phase, (ii) validation phase, and (iii) statistical analysis
   for the theoretical phase. A literature review was conducted to study
   the applications of BIM in steel building projects and to develop an
   integrated BIM process map for the construction lifecycle of steel
   buildings. Subsequently, in the validation phase, 32 participants were
   invited to complete a two-round Delphi questionnaire to validate the
   BIM-DFE proposal. The participants were classified according to their
   knowledge level (skilled or expert). Based on the literature review, a
   process map that integrates BIM in different phases of a steel building
   project was created. In the first round of the Delphi questionnaire for
   the validation phase, the various groups studied (skilled vs. expert)
   were in moderate agreement with the BIM-DFE proposal; however, after the
   second round, this agreement became better. Therefore, this study
   contributes to the current body of knowledge by providing a BIM
   integration model to improve the management of steel building projects
   as defined by critical stakeholders in the steel industry. In addition,
   a real-time case is presented to elucidate a part of the research
   contribution.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the wide use of LCA for environmental profiling, the
   approach for determining the system boundary within LCA models continues
   to be subjective and lacking in mathematical rigor. As a result, life
   cycle models are often developed in an ad hoc manner, and are difficult
   to compare. Significant environmental impacts may be inadvertently left
   out. Overcoming this shortcoming can help elicit greater confidence in
   life cycle models and their use for decision making. Methods This paper
   describes a framework for hybrid life cycle model generation by
   selecting activities based on their importance, parametric uncertainty,
   and contribution to network complexity. The importance of activities is
   determined by structural path analysis-which then guides the
   construction of life cycle models based on uncertainty and complexity
   indicators. Information about uncertainty is from the available life
   cycle inventory; complexity is quantified by cost or granularity. The
   life cycle model is developed in a hierarchical manner by adding the
   most important activities until error requirements are satisfied or
   network complexity exceeds user-specified constraints. Results and
   Discussion The framework is applied to an illustrative example for
   building a hybrid LCA model. Since this is a constructed example, the
   results can be compared with the actual impact, to validate the
   approach. This application demonstrates how the algorithm sequentially
   develops a life cycle model of acceptable uncertainty and network
   complexity. Challenges in applying this framework to practical problems
   are discussed. Conclusion The presented algorithm designs system
   boundaries between scales of hybrid LCA models, includes or omits
   activities from the system based on path analysis of environmental
   impact contribution at upstream network nodes, and provides model
   quality indicators that permit comparison between different LCA models.},

Abstract = {The construction industry and researchers have been exploring new
   techniques to improve the sustainability of buildings. One such solution
   is the use of a recent technology such as building information modelling
   (BIM). Accordingly, the present article reviews the current state of
   literature on sustainable construction and BIM, including the latter's
   evolution. In contrast to previous reviews on this subject, the present
   work has a broader scope that covers the environmental, economic, and
   social dimensions and their combinations. To obtain a comprehensive
   review, the authors conducted an informetric analysis of the literature
   and categorised it based on a content analysis. A total of 11 different
   terms and 28 combinations were used to collect relevant literature on
   this subject, resulting in a total of 317 journal articles for the
   period between 2008 and 2017. The information obtained from informetric
   analysis was later validated by a content analysis, in which gaps and
   trends were identified. It was observed that publications on this
   subject registered an exponential growth, with 90\% of the articles
   being published in the last five years. The authors identified a gap in
   literature pertaining to the integration of the three dimensions of
   sustainability; however, literature on the integration of sustainable
   performance and BIM has grown considerably in recent years, which
   indicates that BIM is increasingly being used as a reliable method for
   sustainable construction practices.},

Abstract = {Carbon emissions are an increasingly important consideration in
   sustainable environmental development. In the green building industry,
   green construction cost controls and low-carbon construction methods are
   considered to be the key barriers encountered. Based on Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) policy, management of carbon emissions from green
   building projects contributes to the acquisition of accurate building
   cost information and to a reduction in the environmental impact of these
   projects. This study focuses on the CO2 emission costs and low-carbon
   construction methods, and proposes a 0-1 mixed integer programming (0-1
   MIP) decision model for integrated green building projects, using an
   Activity-Based Cost (ABC) and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The
   major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) the integrated
   model can help construction company managers to more accurately
   understand how to allocate resources and funding for energy saving
   activities to each green building through appropriate cost drivers; (2)
   this model provides a pre-construction decision-making tool which will
   assist management in bidding on environmentally-friendly construction
   projects; and (3) this study contributes to the innovation operation
   research (OR) literature, especially in regard to incorporating the life
   cycle assessment measurement into construction cost management by
   utilizing a mixed decision model for green building projects. (C) 2014

Title = {Analysis of the underlying factors affecting BIM-LCA integration in the
   Ghanaian construction industry: a factor analysis approach},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThe integration of building information modelling (BIM) and life
   cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective means of achieving sustainability
   in the built environment. However, research remains scant on BIM-LCA
   integration in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI). This study aims
   to evaluate the barriers to BIM-LCA integration in the GCI from the
   perspective of construction
   professionals.Design/methodology/approachEpistemologically relevant
   theory was developed using interpretivism and post-positivist principles
   and tested using primary quantitative data. Firstly, a comprehensive
   literature review identified and examined BIM-LCA integration barriers.
   Structured surveys of 216 Ghanaian construction professionals collected
   data on BIM-LCA integration barriers. Data was then analysed using
   exploratory factor analysis.FindingsFindings revealed three clusters of
   barriers, namely, organisational barriers; technical complexity; and
   knowledge and education. These findings identify and recommend solutions
   to BIM-LCA integration barriers to standardise processes, raise
   awareness and integrate project management systems. BIM-LCA adoption
   will increase productivity, sustainability, construction sector
   employment (and skills development) and economic growth. This paper
   concludes with future research on how artificial intelligence and
   machine learning could improve BIM-LCA integration in building designs.
   Such work would reveal how new technologies can be used to overcome
   adoption barriers and promote sustainable building.Originality/valueThis
   research provides novel knowledge on the barriers to BIM-LCA adoption in
   Ghana. Practical recommendations for overcoming these barriers are also
   proposed, e.g. developing standardised procedures and protocols,
   increasing awareness and education and integrating BIM-LCA into project
   management systems.},

Abstract = {The adoption of digital technologies in the construction sector is seen
   by many as a catalyst for the ecological transition, through the
   optimization of resource and energy use. However, the environmental
   impact of the digital infrastructure supporting projects is not well
   known. In the example of life cycle management of linear
   infrastructures, the increased use of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors
   for maintenance/operation has been followed by a diversification of
   technologies for Building InformationModeling (BIM), Building Life cycle
   Management (BLM), equipment and exchange formats. The variety of
   computer terminals, hardware storage and communication equipment are
   extended by that of software tools and free or proprietary solutions.
   The main objective of this paper is to establish a methodology based on
   environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental
   impacts of a digital service in Infrastructure LifecycleManagement
   (ILM). Relying on a case study of a bridge monitoring system implemented
   for the A71 near Orleans, France, we propose to model the assessed
   system as four interacting sub-systems: data acquisition, network and
   communication, consultation, and data storage. Based on such modelling
   and related data, a preliminary assessment highlights the contribution
   of data storage in the environmental impacts of the overall system.},

Title = {Understanding the perceptions of stakeholders on selective demolition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Selective demolition (or deconstruction) is important for achieving
   efficient circular principles in the construction sector, involving
   various stakeholders in the whole life cycle of buildings. Several
   studies have been conducted in recent years about it, but an assessment
   concerning the stakeholders involved was never undertaken to explore the
   criteria chosen here. This study aims to explore the practices of
   companies, but also the perception of individuals regarding this theme.
   A Portuguese case study was chosen, submitting an online structured
   questionnaire. As a result, 79 responses were received and an
   independent variable concerning profession was selected to divide the
   sample into three groups (architects, engineers, and other staff), to
   explore whether statistical differences between groups exist. Regarding
   the activity of companies, 22.8\% have never conducted a selective
   demolition process, and the remaining respondents predominantly do so
   due to contract specifications. Also, 37.7\% of respondents confirmed a
   need to subcontract, demonstrating dependence on cooperation. Assessing
   individual perceptions, architects have a more accurate understanding of
   the concept of selective demolition in the life cycle of buildings, and
   yet clearly state a greater need for information and awareness regarding
   the process than engineers and other staff. Architects also identified,
   most firmly, the need to promote the design of construction materials
   that better facilitate reuse and recycling. These results are relevant
   to decision making processes and for effective policy design, to form
   strategies that boost selective demolition, using a behavioural change
   approach, identifying a need to reinforce education and awareness, for
   instance about pre-demolition audits.},

Title = {Barriers to the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   for facility management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Reportedly, the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a
   collaborative methodology for the life-cycle management of a building
   has numerous benefits. Nevertheless, its adoption during the operational
   stage remains limited, and the New Zealand (NZ) built environment is no
   exception. The present study offers a prioritized list of barriers that
   are inhibiting industry-wide adoption of BIM during the facility
   management (FM) phase. Both BIM and FM contexts were first thoroughly
   reviewed to identify the potential barriers (26), which were then
   refined via semi-structured interviews with qualified experts
   representing industry and academia. The refined barriers (20) were then
   prioritized through a hybrid Parsimonious Fuzzy AHP approach. Despite
   the leadership of the decision-makers in promoting the use of BIM in all
   phases of the building life cycle, the cost-related barriers (both for
   BIM software/hardware and training) remain the most significant.
   Perhaps, as a result of this, lack of expertise and unfamiliarity with
   BIM associated technology is among the most inhibiting barriers, which
   also requires utmost attention. It can be concluded that the industry
   stakeholders need to commit additional resources to help overcome the
   barriers and enable a wider application of BIM for FM. Increased
   application of BIM for FM will have positive implications for the future
   of the FM industry and digital future of the built environment, which
   has been a national strategy. The results are believed to identify the
   most crucial barriers impeding technology supported change in FM
   practices.},

Abstract = {Today, modern technologies and methods of the improvement of the
   digitization in Germany - e.g., the application of the Radio Frequency
   identification (RFID) technology also in connection with the method of
   the Building Information Modeling (BIM) - find increased implementation
   in construction economy and real estate economy in Germany. For many
   years, the research team of the Chair of Construction Management \&
   Economics of the Bergische University of Wuppertal has dealt with the
   development of those modern technologies and methods. Now these subjects
   are transferred into new education and training programs. These programs
   are based and further developed on the present knowledge. For the
   education of students in Germany, different study drafts will be
   developed in cooperation with the Jade University of Oldenburg.
   Construction engineers and architects will be taught a process-oriented
   method with the use of BIM, integrating the application of modern
   technologies comprehensively along the life cycle of buildings.
   Furthermore, within the research project ``BIM-based construction with
   RFID technology{''}, there was developed an integrated teaching
   demonstration module which shows the data exchange and data consistency
   in the life cycle of buildings very clearly. For a period of 2 years,
   this specific demonstration module will be presented to the public and
   different institutions, like educational centers, universities, building
   contractors and developer of the industry. An international comparison
   of these attempts offers interesting aspects concerning any transference
   potential. The conference contribution will contain the first results of
   new drafts for integration of modern technologies and methods in the
   education and training for the construction and real estate economy in
   Germany.},

Title = {Triple bottom line sustainability assessment of window-to-wall ratio in
   US office buildings},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {182},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The window-to-wall ratio (WWR), or the proportion of glazing in a
   building's envelope, influences many design and performance aspects of a
   building across its life cycle, including aesthetics, material use,
   daylighting, HVAC size and operating energy consumption, view, and human
   satisfaction. Prior work argued for reducing WWR to reduce operating
   energy consumption. The objective of this study is to comprehensively
   assess the environmental, economic, and social effects of various WWR
   levels using a triple-bottom line approach. A building information model
   of the US DOE's large office (12 story) prototype building was developed
   using Autodesk Revit (R). The Tally (R) Revit application and DOE's
   EnergyPlus (TM) were used to perform life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   assess implications on HVAC equipment sizing, embodied energy of
   materials, and distribution of operational energy. Designs altering WWR
   from a baseline of 40\% were compared in three different climate zones
   of the United States. Results showed that increasing the WWR in large
   office buildings leads to increases in environmental impacts, occupant
   dissatisfaction, and the life cycle cost for the three different climate
   zones studied. Most reductions in energy use and environmental impacts
   were approximately 1\% from the baseline scenario for the office
   building under study. The results imply that while reductions in the WWR
   do result in improvements across the suite of metrics assessed, other
   design strategies need to be employed either in conjunction with, or
   separate from, in order to meet target energy consumption and
   environmental impact reduction goals within this building program, such
   as Architecture 2030 Challenges.},

Title = {Integrating building information modelling with sustainability to design
   building projects at the conceptual stage},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {429-444},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lately the construction industry has become more interested in designing
   and constructing environmentally friendly buildings (e.g. sustainable
   buildings) that can provide both high performance and monetary savings.
   In general, sustainability integrates the following three related
   components: (1) environmental, (2) economic, (3) social well-being.
   Incorporating these components at the conceptual stage is achieved by
   using sustainable design, through which designers must identify
   associated materials and systems based on any selected certification
   (rating) system. The use of building information modelling (BIM)
   concepts helps engineers design digital models that allow owners to
   visualize the building before the physical implementation takes place.
   To apply BIM concepts, designers use tools to create 3D models of
   buildings where the design materials and systems are selected from the
   built-in database of these tools. Designers will not be able to quantify
   the environmental impacts of these materials to support the decisions
   needed to design sustainable buildings due to the following reasons: (1)
   a lack of information about the sustainable materials that are stored in
   the database, (2) a lack of interoperability between the design and
   analysis tools that enable full life cycle assessments (LCAs) of
   buildings. This paper presents a methodology that integrates BIM and LCA
   tools with a database for designing sustainable building projects. The
   methodology describes the development and implementation of a model that
   incorporates a database in which information about sustainable materials
   is stored and linked to a BIM (3D) module along with an LCA module and a
   certification and cost module. The goal of this model is to simplify the
   process of creating sustainable designs and to evaluate the
   environmental impacts (EI) of newly designed buildings at the conceptual
   stage of their life. An actual building project is presented in order to
   illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed model.},

Abstract = {With the recent digitization of the construction industry, the
   management of a project, from the idea to the use phases, is now based
   on the Building Information Modelling System (BIM). While the use of BIM
   begins to show its effectiveness in building construction, it does not
   satisfy yet linear infrastructure domain. One of the requirements is to
   manage the infrastructure project data around a common information
   system, as defined by the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) definition.
   Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear
   infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways.
   The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is
   promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle
   management must now consider all phases of the project, especially
   Operations and Maintenance (O\&M), where the use of the 3D model is no
   longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the
   Infrastructure. To facilitate the digital transition when projects are
   split into several phases, the linear infrastructure must be represented
   by one and only one Digital Twin during its life cycle. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is always a major concern in the Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This paper presents the
   implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology in the
   development of a lifecycle cost-estimating tool. The IFC (Industry
   Foundation Classes) model as an interoperable building information model
   has been adopted as the central data repository to deliver the
   integrated information of building designs from CAD design systems into
   the lifecycle-costing database. In this paper, the conceptions and
   relevant factors, which could affect the LCC estimation, have been
   introduced. The problems of current LCC applications have been
   identified as the lack of LCC data and the complexity of LCC exercises.
   The software application of IFC models and relevant auxiliary are
   depicted as a solution of the problem identified. The lifecycle costing
   tool is a part of the nD Modelling tool and as such is based on its

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of Embodied Carbon and Strategies for
   Decarbonization of a High-Rise Residential Building},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for the 40\% of consumed
   resources, 40\% of CO2 emissions, and approximately 40\% of construction
   and demolition waste. For the assessment of the building, there exists a
   standardized method, life cycle assessment (LCA), however, the process
   requires time, cost, and most importantly expertise. In this paper, a
   method is proposed and analyzed for the life cycle assessment of the
   building for the embodied carbon in the three stages, construction,
   operation, and demolition. Moreover, the result of the analysis is
   considered as the base result, and de-carbonization strategies
   identified through literature study for the three stages of
   construction, operation, and demolition are assessed with the same
   method to know how much each strategy will be effective in minimizing
   the embodied carbon. For the base case, a high-rise residential building
   in an urban region of India is analyzed, based on existing conditions
   through the building information modeling (BIM) method. The carbon
   emission of the selected building comes out to be 414 kg
   CO(2)e/m(2)/year, and assessing different decarbonization strategies,
   considering the first analysis as the baseline, it can be minimized to
   135 kg CO(2)e/m(2)/year.},

Title = {Life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of a traditional and a
   smart HVAC control system for Australian office buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, many novel smart technologies have been proposed to
   reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   attributed to the building sector. One such application of these
   technologies is the reduction of the Heating, Ventilation and Air
   Conditioning (HVAC) energy needs and GHG emissions using smart control
   systems. The environmental benefits of smart control systems during
   building operation have been explored in many studies, however, their
   embodied effects, associated with the extraction of raw materials,
   manufacturing and replacement are often overlooked. Accordingly, this
   study quantifies the life cycle energy needs and GHG emissions of a
   smart HVAC control system and assesses its potential for reducing the
   HVAC operational energy and GHG emissions in an Australian office
   building. A comparative assessment is performed, considering a
   traditional HVAC control system and an equivalent smart HVAC control
   system. The components of both the traditional and smart control systems
   are specified based on the characteristics of these systems as well as
   the layout of the serviced spaces in the reference building. The
   embodied energy and GHG emissions of both the traditional and smart
   control systems are quantified through a hybrid life cycle inventory
   (LCI) approach. To evaluate the effects of these control systems on the
   building HVAC operational energy, a building energy simulation is
   performed by applying the control logics of both systems. The results
   show that energy and GHG emissions savings in the HVAC operational
   offset the additional energy needs and GHG emissions of deploying the
   smart HVAC control system.},

Title = {Application of life-cycle assessment to early stage building design for
   reduced embodied environmental impacts},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Decisions made during a building's early design stages critically
   determine its environmental impact. However, designers are faced with
   many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which
   decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result,
   designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process.
   Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage
   decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of
   building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents
   a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to
   inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of
   building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity
   analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building
   shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed
   that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements,
   and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness
   decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A
   multi-building residential development is used as a case study for
   introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that
   the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting
   those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant
   reductions in embodied carbon footprint. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Life cycle assessment applied to facility management of exposed steel
   frames - case study},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 6},
Abstract = {PurposeFacility management (FM) plays an important role in the
   attainment of a sustainable built environment during the building
   operational stage since it is responsible for decisions that influence
   materials' durability, waste, cost reduction and energy efficiency.
   However, the integration of the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach in
   FM presents some difficulties in obtaining complete inventories for
   building components, tracking material flows and defining system
   boundaries. This paper aims to establish the environmental impact
   comparison between maintenance actions and replacement interventions
   performed during the life cycle of a steel frame from a building
   facade.Design/methodology/approachFor this purpose, the effects of
   different repair/maintenance actions and end-of-life scenarios were
   analysed using two tools: an LCA building information modelling-based
   tool and an LCA open-source tool.FindingsThe results showed that
   repairing and maintaining the steel structure is essential for the
   safety and preservation of the steel structure. However, steel
   maintenance and repair practices that involve fewer environmental
   impacts need to be explored.Social implicationsIt also emphasises the
   crucial role of facility managers in promoting sustainability and
   supporting informed decision-making throughout the building's life
   cycle, thereby aiding in the pursuit of sustainable development and the
   goal of decarbonisation by 2050.Originality/valueThis study reveals that
   maintenance processes in building management have a greater
   environmental impact compared to material replacement activities,
   especially concerning the steel structure within the case study
   building, as assessed using two LCA software tools. The findings provide
   valuable insights into the environmental impacts of maintenance and
   replacement phases and underscore the need for further investigation
   into more sustainable maintenance practices within facility management.
   Additionally, the study raises public awareness and engagement in
   environmental responsibility, contributing positively to the achievement
   of a sustainable built environment.},

Abstract = {Considering the serious challenges our planet is facing, the building
   environment and construction sector must minimize their high negative
   impacts and maximize their contribution to sustainability. Many
   alternatives could promote this change, but to effectively optimize our
   architecture, we must take the step of quantifying and qualifying the
   sustainability of our constructions by choosing the best assessment
   alternative in each case. Many assessment methodologies and tools exist
   and there have been numerous reviews of them. The main objective and
   novelty of this review is to present an updated critical overview of all
   the sustainability evaluation alternatives developed in research studies
   in the fields of architectural design, construction, refurbishment and
   restoration. To achieve this, the analysis follows a specific
   methodology based on recent similar reviews. The result is a database
   with 1242 eligible documents analyzed in this review and attached as
   supplementary material available for future studies. As a main
   conclusion, rating tools and life cycle methods were found to be the
   most commonly applied methodologies, while the most recent tendencies
   use combined methods and probabilistic scenarios. This review could be
   useful to move towards a more sustainable building environment.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the standard method for the
   quantification of environmental impacts within the construction sector,
   relying on available generic LCA databases. New developments, such as
   the increased influence of the building construction for LCA and the
   forthcoming of building information modeling (BIM), implicate new
   requirements on multiscale levels of development and complexity for LCA
   construction databases. At the example of the German ``Okobau.dat{''},
   one of the leading LCA construction databases, this publication
   discusses whether the database is able to meet these requirements. The
   analysis shows the strengths of the Okobau. dat with regard to
   standardization conformity (EN 15804, ILCD), data provision in
   machine-readable XML format, and the provision of an application
   programming interface. Shortcomings include incorrect linking of
   building life cycle inventory data with environmental information,
   incorrect documentation of functional units, missing generic datasets,
   the modeling of energy use data or the lack of a uniform structuring, or
   material classification. The authors propose solutions such as the
   provision of appropriate functional units, the implementation of a
   top-down approach to investigate the completeness of data based on
   existing nomenclatures or the extension with an appropriate material
   classification. This would allow for future viability and adaptability
   of Okobau. dat for digital LCA.},

Abstract = {A digital twin involves technology including data analytics, artificial
   intelligence, and IoT that acquire and analyze heterogeneous data from
   multiple sources, which creates a living digital simulation model that
   supports the decision-making process. The adoption of building
   information models (BIM) is one of the core digital twin technologies
   that can be applied in architecture, engineering, construction,
   operation, and facility management (AECO/FM) sectors. However, current
   developments related to building DTs are at an early stage in the
   building life cycle, especially regarding integrating and analyzing
   asset and facility management technologies. This study presents a novel
   holistic system to construct a building-level DT integrating BIM data in
   the building life cycle from a multi-stakeholder perspective. First,
   current challenges faced by stakeholders are documented and analyzed by
   a requirement model. Then, a multilayered framework is proposed to
   underpin the complex requirements when tackling the challenges. This
   framework assists five major areas of asset and facility management:
   space, energy, operation, safety, and maintenance. A web-based system
   based on the proposed framework is developed and visualized through a
   game engine in a case study for a commercial building in China. This
   developed building-level DT system is comprehensive, robust, and can
   efficiently and effectively satisfy the requirements of different
   stakeholders, such as the estate management team and maintenance staff,
   who may not have BIM experience. Finally, insights and challenges for
   researchers and practitioners are concluded and discussed.},

Title = {FROM BIM TO DIGITAL TWINS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EVOLUTION OF
   INTELLIGENT BUILDING REPRESENTATIONS IN THE AEC-FM INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {58-83},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the
   recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several
   new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle
   of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time
   connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the
   emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment.
   Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a
   virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction
   process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life
   cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital
   Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there
   is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling
   technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future
   research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the
   development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of
   BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100
   related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In
   order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors
   developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the
   building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital
   Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were
   further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction
   process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In
   addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital
   Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found
   that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully
   exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and
   thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis
   of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors
   propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as
   a baseline for further studies.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy-efficient building retrofits must be approached from three
   perspectives: law regulation approach, financial incentives approach,
   and practice approach. The concepts of zero energy building and life
   cycle energy building are presented as the basis for energy retrofits.
   Multi-criteria boards to assess the decision-making process are
   reviewed, analysed, and categorised under an architectonic perspective.
   Some examples are presented, with different packages of measures, from
   deep to non-invasive energy retrofits. Passive and active energy
   generation systems, together with control and management strategies, are
   the physical elements identified with the potential to improve
   buildings' energy efficiency. From a practice approach, this literature
   review identifies the concept of performance-based architectural design
   to optimise the planning and design of buildings' energy retrofits. In
   addition, tools such as Building Information Modelling are described as
   part of optimisation processes, as they enable designers to rapidly
   analyse and simulate a building's performance at the design stage.},

Title = {INTEGRATING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND SENSOR TECHNOLOGY
   FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {440-458},
Abstract = {Today high-performance buildings are equipped with sophisticated
   monitoring systems and sensors for collecting large amounts of data
   related to the buildings' indoor environmental quality and energy
   consumption. To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data,
   facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or
   spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the
   real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is
   a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that
   supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole
   building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time
   information related to the performance of the building in the
   operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration
   of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable
   visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i)
   Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and
   (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between
   the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated
   limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize
   widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of
   a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data
   characterization and analysis. The overarching aim of this paper is to
   improve the efficiency of facility management (FM) and utilize BIM data

Title = {An integrated decision support system for building asset management
   based on BIM and Work Breakdown Structure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The asset management phase of a building constitutes approximately 60\%
   of its total lifecycle costs. However, significant unnecessary expenses
   occur in current asset management practices because of the separation of
   the design and construction phases from operation and maintenance and
   the lack of an effective building asset management system covering all
   types of buildings with numerous components. Asset management
   decision-making is inherently a process that requires the assimilation
   of a multitude of data, processes, and software systems. Therefore, this
   paper proposes an integrated decision support system for building asset
   management that addresses the systematization and coordination of
   lifecycle data. In this approach, a lifecycle work breakdown structure
   (WBS) for the asset management system is developed to provide a unified
   hierarchy to categorize and organize building assets. It is then used to
   develop the WBS-based integrated building lifecycle asset management
   model through a relational database management system (DBMS). Since
   building information modelling (BIM) is a rich information-based
   platform with large volumes of asset data needed, it is integrated with
   the WBS-based DBMS to achieve an effective integrated building asset
   management. A case study of an educational building is presented and
   discussed in the paper to demonstrate how the proposed automated
   solution is used for asset management. The research contributes to the
   body of knowledge by formalizing a WBS-based unified asset inventory
   hierarchy and mapping BIM data to the proposed hierarchy for effective
   asset management.},

Abstract = {A building information model (BIM) is just one component of the jigsaw
   puzzle of high quality information management to control the life cycle
   processes around building structures. A BIM in itself is not sufficient
   to solve adequately the ICT support shortcomings of the building
   production chain. The BIM should be embedded in a formal description of
   all needed exchange requirements. The ISO/buildingSMART standard
   Information Delivery Manual (IDM) is a perfect point of departure for
   such a formal interaction framework. In addition, the significance of
   (standard) object type libraries is still seriously underestimated. Real
   interoperability can only be established with a BIM that maintains
   strong links to one or more object libraries. This paper discusses how
   the interaction frameworks, object libraries and the building
   information model are related and demonstrate the way this approach is
   applied to introduce BIM in an actual highway design/build/maintenance
   project in the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the dynamics of organisational change by building on
   firm life-cycle theory. Extant research assumed that the development of
   firms follows a certain sequence of stages. Based on the life-cycle

   organisational characteristics and firm growth during the development of
   ICT SMEs in Hungary. Hypotheses are tested using multivariate
   statistical methods. Results show that stagnant firms are not
   significantly different from the ones undergoing incremental changes,
   but significant growth coincides with radical organisational changes.
   Our findings highlight that team-based decision making, complex

   and Facilities: Recent Applications and Future Perspectives},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {At present, increased modes of transport have facilitated daily life.
   Building information modeling (BIM) integration has become a key
   strategy to foster efficiency, collaboration, and sustainability in the
   fields of buildings, transport, and facilities. Currently, there is a
   scarcity of comprehensive examinations of the performance of integrated
   BIM with transport facilities and applications to help identify
   potential prospects for sustainable development. Hence, this research
   paper attempts to scrutinize the integration of BIM, transportation, and
   facilities (T and Fs) by highlighting future directions and trends,
   revealing the existing status and hotspots of research in the field, and
   clarifying the developmental pulse of research as well as emerging areas
   in the future. A quantitative research technique is utilized in this
   study, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software, and the Web of Science
   Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The study findings suggest that the
   hot keywords for the integration of BIM and T and Fs are predominantly
   concentrated on construction, framework, system, design, and management.
   In addition, over the previous 34 years (years 1989 to 2023), the
   applications of point cloud, digital twin, and life cycle assessment
   have been the current hot topics, and these emerging technologies can
   offer more innovative breakthroughs for the future. Furthermore, the
   integration of BIM and T and Fs represents an important trend that is
   essential for improving the efficiency, sustainability, and intelligence
   of buildings and infrastructure, from which the three domains can create
   synergies that contribute to the better planning, construction, and
   management of building and infrastructure projects.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Accurate quantification and detailed classification of construction
   waste are paramount to improving their management. Over the last
   decades, various quantification models have been developed to measure,
   manage, and report construction waste generation. A detailed
   understanding of those models is essential to explore their applications
   across the life-cycle stages of a built asset. Existing reviews
   primarily focused on analysing the functions of quantification
   methodologies, but the digital and information standards to automate the
   quantifi-cation process are under-explored in the existing literature. A
   review is adopted to analyse papers published from 2012 to 2022. Out of
   279 articles retrieved, 71 papers meeting the eligibility criteria were
   included. A critical analysis of the models indicates that unified data
   structure, standard information, life-cycle approach and
   interoperability between the BIM and waste knowledge bases are vital to
   automate and reinforce the quantifi-cation efficiency. Based on the
   review findings, a conceptual framework is developed to demonstrate the
   quantification workflow for building projects. The outcomes from the
   review will facilitate researchers to identify the prevailing gaps and
   enhance the waste quantification system to meet digital construction

Title = {An integrated BIM-based framework for the optimization of the trade-off
   between embodied and operational energy},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {1189-1205},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Design choices with a unilateral focus on the reduction of operational
   energy for developing energy efficient and near-zero energy building
   practices can increase the impact of the embodied energy, as there is a
   trade-off between embodied and operational energy. Multi-objective
   optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to
   find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research
   in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the
   embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration
   of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for
   facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and
   utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an
   interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To
   address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the
   making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem
   between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a
   multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process.
   The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype
   and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which
   showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE)
   use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off
   to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case
   study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site
   location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could
   result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the
   optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to
   the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years
   of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling,
   excluding household electricity use. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The World's changing climate, directs all the efforts of humanity in the
   adaptive nature of reducing the impact of their activities. The author
   focuses in the text on the idea of `resilience' in the reorientation of
   design practices towards to build a bank of matter. The use of
   information from already occurred events, should lead to adapt in to
   climatic conditions, as it happens in nature. The first part, show the
   principles and context of building design process which is not always in
   the sustainable development idea. It shows the activity of architecture
   and construction, as negative impact on the environment which we can
   also experience and categorized as an effect of changing climate. The
   second part, attempts to determine aspects, which should characterize
   the early and last design stage, which defines the ecological life cycle
   of an architectural object - building as a creator of Cities. The
   conclusion, talks about the matter in the design process - DNA - as a
   whole materiality (life cycle - before use, use, after use - pollutions,
   embodied energy, embodied carbon, serviceability) of the building.
   Paper refers directly to the architectural-environmental dimensions,
   orienting the design process of buildings in respect of widely
   comprehended climatic changes. Author's research results highlight the
   fact in the idea of the matter bank - the equivalent of city matter.
   Moreover, ideas are formulated as the `resilience' which draws from the
   information, from already existing events and through processing by
   adjusting them and using again. The work aims to draw attention to the
   ever-growing methods of researching the building, such as: Life Cycle
   Analysis and Building Information Modelling, as the future of
   sustainable, conscious architecture design in a changing climate.},

Title = {Combining Building Information Model and Life Cycle Assessment for
   Defining Circular Economy Strategies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although the construction industry has the potential to implement
   circular economy (CE) principles, the sector suffers from a veritable
   lack of initiatives to develop circular and regenerative design
   principles. However, existing buildings intended to be demolished could
   be considered as material banks for future constructions, with the aim
   to exploit anthropogenic resources, extend material/product efficiency,
   and reduce the extraction of natural resources. This concept of
   buildings as material banks is being studied more and more in the
   scientific literature, but it still requires the existing building stock
   to be fully digitalized, thus making materials reusable in new buildings
   starting from the architectural design stage. Moreover, the decision
   process regarding CE strategies requires the consideration of the
   environmental impacts of the deconstruction and end-of-life processes,
   which is essential in CE implementation. This paper introduces a digital
   platform for generating materials inventory and supporting the
   definition of reuse strategies. Then, by using digital tools in
   combination with life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of the
   deconstruction process and output of materials and components
   inventories, a method is defined and tested on a pilot building in
   Luxembourg.},

Title = {Machine learning algorithms for energy efficiency: Mitigating carbon
   dioxide emissions and optimizing costs in a hospital infrastructure},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {318},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings incur significant energy consumption due to their
   expensive operations, advanced medical equipment, strict sanitation
   protocols, and compliance with environmental standards in various
   weather conditions. For this study, focusing on two distinct climate
   regions in Turkey-Aksaray and Bursa provinces-a total of 1,440 unique
   scenarios were generated. These scenarios utilized materials from the
   Revit Building Information Modeling (BIM) software library,
   incorporating variations in thermal transmittance coefficients, solar
   heat gain coefficients, and building orientation angles. The research
   employed machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption,
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, total expenditures, and life cycle
   costs. While the Revit BIM software library provides numerous
   combinations of building materials, it's important to note that only a
   limited subset undergoes practical testing during construction. The main
   objective is to streamline the estimation of energy consumption, CO2
   emissions, overall costs, and life cycle expenditures in similar
   architectural settings and under comparable climate conditions,
   eliminating the need for drafting and energy calculation software.
   Across all machine learning algorithms, predictions generated by
   artificial neural networks closely aligned with actual values. Notably,
   the R-squared (R2) values, a critical evaluation metric, produced the
   following outcomes: both R2 values for energy were 0.95; total costs
   achieved 0.93 and 0.97; CO2 emissions attained 0.94 and 0.97; and life
   cycle costs garnered 0.95 and 0.94 for validation and test datasets,
   respectively. These results suggest that the successes observed in the
   two provinces can be extrapolated to data from all regions in Turkey.
   Moreover, our model is capable of predicting energy consumption, costs,
   and CO2 emissions based on thermal transmittance values complying with
   the Turkish standard TS 825 and building orientation angles.},

Title = {Proposed time-dependent approach to seismic loss evaluation through the
   life cycle of a structure},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {280-290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, an efficient time-dependent approach to seismic loss
   evaluation is proposed to calculate the probability distribution
   function of the life cycle cost of a structure. In the current
   literature, the evaluation of seismic loss has almost exclusively
   focused on estimating the mean value of the life cycle cost which does
   not include the information about the full extent of seismic loss
   variability. The proposed method aims to employ the FEMA-P-58 approach
   in evaluating the probabilistic distribution of total seismic repair
   cost in the life cycle of a structure. This method also considers the
   effect of time-dependent phenomena on loss evaluation while it keeps the
   required computational effort at an affordable level. A Monte Carlo
   sampling technique is applied to consider all sources of uncertainties.
   In this approach, the appropriate response distribution of the structure
   is extracted from the incremental dynamic analysis results, and there is
   no need to repeat complex dynamic analysis calculations in each
   realization. To better demonstrate the proposed method, the life cycle
   cost of a 5-story steel special moment frame is investigated with
   various assumptions on its time-dependent specifications such as the
   monetary discounting effects, the influence of different discount rates
   and building depreciation over time.},

Journal = {HELIYON},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As a new construction form, modular integrated construction (MiC) can
   effectively improve the construction quality and productivity,
   especially for the construction of high-density and highrise buildings.
   However, the current MiC quality inspection relies on manual inspection,
   which is inefficient and unreliable. Systematic research on digital
   inspection techniques (DITs) is frag-mented and unable to fully realize
   the potential of the MiC industry. This study aims to explore the
   current state of DIT applications in MiC and to summarize the knowledge
   in the field through an analysis of 248 relevant literatures.
   Accordingly, this study combines bibliometric analysis, and a system
   engineering evaluation approach based on 3D structures (time, knowledge,
   and logic) to provide an overview of the current state of DIT
   development. The overview includes the application of DITs from a whole
   life cycle perspective, the DIT knowledge structure, specific DIT
   applications, as well as current challenges and future prospects.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of building information modeling
   ( BIM) and life-cycle cost ( LCC) analysis in the development of a
   BIM-game prototype. The authors address the interoperability of the game
   engine and use LCC analysis to enhance visualization and education.
   Inexperienced owners or stakeholders have difficulty understanding the
   relationship between initial cost and LCC, and therefore typically
   choose the initial value, which seems economical from their point of
   view. The primary objective of this paper, however, was to create a
   BIM-game prototype that helps owners, stakeholders, or students
   visualize and quickly understand the relationship between LCC and
   initial cost. To this end, the authors create a BIM-game prototype that
   integrates BIM with a game engine simulation ( i. e., Unity 3D) into an
   LCC analysis visualization. The BIM-game prototype allows users to
   navigate their building environments with the capability of simulating
   the LCC. The elements of the system are a combination from among many
   fields including architecture, engineering, computer programming, and
   game development. These elements connect various areas such as building
   modeling, animation, navigation, and collision detection. Changing the
   materials and adding construction accessories simultaneously improved
   the LCC and the interaction of game engine controllers and the player's
   interface. Finally, the authors developed a survey to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the BIM-game prototype. The results show significant
   potential for using the system in future projects.},

Abstract = {While BIM processes are established for new buildings, the majority of
   existing buildings is not maintained, refurbished or deconstructed with
   BIM yet. Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate
   research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient
   documentation prevalent in existing buildings.
   Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand
   a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in
   existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent
   publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in
   existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high
   modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM
   objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of
   uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing
   buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards,
   challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM
   adaption to existing buildings' requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {One of the key drivers that influence building energy consumption is the
   demand for space heating. Particularly in countries with cold climates
   and a large stock of residential buildings with central heating,
   building energy management systems (BEMS) are an option to reduce energy
   consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These systems can be
   combined with existing space heating technologies and other efficiency
   measures, such as building insulation. They are ideal for retrofitting
   purposes owing to their low up-front costs. A prospective life cycle
   assessment model is used to analyze the environmental impacts of the
   technology today, in 2030, and in 2050. This allows for a first-ever,
   order-of-magnitude assessment of the environmental impacts of BEMS over
   their life cycle. The assessment is based on manufacturer information
   and generic life cycle inventory data for electronic components. Future
   impacts are based on changes in electricity generation following the
   International Energy Agency's 2 degree and 6 degree scenarios, and are
   used to assess the contribution of BEMS to global energy and GHG saving
   goals. Results show substantially lower life cycle GHG emissions and
   higher savings of environmental impacts per kilowatt-hour of heating
   when compared to natural gas or electric heating. Potential net
   emissions savings range from approximately 0.4 kilograms carbon dioxide
   equivalent (kg CO2-eq) when avoiding natural gas heating to over 1 kg
   CO2-eq when avoiding electric heating in regions with GHG-intensive
   electricity generation. At present, BEMS can avoid at least 40 times the
   GHG emissions that they require for production and use, when deployed in
   regions with cold climates.},

Title = {BIM-integrated LCA to automate embodied carbon assessment of
   prefabricated buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {374},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been leveraged to reduce manual
   efforts in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings. However, data
   interoperability between BIM and LCA tools remains a significant
   challenge because of disparate data structures, leading to a deficiency
   in automatic data mapping methods. Few studies have adopted professional
   BIM and LCA tools to evaluate the embodied carbon of prefabricated
   buildings at multiple spatial levels. Thus, this paper developed a
   BIM-integrated LCA solution to automate the embodied carbon assessment
   of prefabricated buildings based on a five-level framework: material,
   component, assembly, flat, and building. The solution framework involved
   three modules: (1) BIM data preparation, (2) data extraction and
   integration, and (3) embodied carbon assessment. An Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC)-enabled data transfer tool was developed to adapt BIM data
   to the LCA data structure automatically. A real-life prefabricated
   building in Hong Kong was used to validate the feasibility of the
   developed solution by comparing it with the traditional LCA method.
   Embodied carbon was reported in five levels. The
   cradle-to-end-of-construction embodied carbon of the case building was
   calculated as 561 kg CO2/m2, showing an acceptable 1\% discrep-ancy with
   traditional LCA results owing to inevitable quantity differences between
   design and construction. The results also indicate a dramatical time
   reduction in the LCA modeling process from 729 min to 62 min, achieving
   a 91.5\% efficiency improvement. It can thus practically increase
   practitioners' willingness to conduct LCA at an early design stage with
   quick feedback. The developed solution also extends the knowledge on
   automatic BIM -integrated LCA methodologically by addressing data
   interoperability using the IFC standard. Further, it provides systematic
   insights into the embodied carbon emissions of prefabricated buildings
   based on the five-level theoretical framework, guiding low-carbon
   designs for prefabricated buildings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a BIM-based Whole-life Performance
   Estimator (BWPE) for appraising the salvage performance of structural
   components of buildings right from the design stage. A review of the
   extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence
   salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their
   useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted
   to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of
   Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model
   was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and
   it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life
   salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated.
   The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable
   connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials
   that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective
   means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings
   are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will
   therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and
   designers to analyse the implication, of designs decision on the salvage
   performance of buildings over time. It will also be useful to the
   demolition engineers and consultants to generate pre-demolition audit
   when the building gets to end of its life.},

Abstract = {Identifying design variations that strike the balance between
   environmental, energy and cost can be aided using multi-objective
   optimization. From the resulting Pareto-solutions, selecting a single
   optimal solution remains a challenge. Thus, research is still needed to
   increase the practical use of optimization for architectural,
   engineering and construction (AEC) practitioners. This paper presents
   the use of an optimization approach where the results and an
   environmental assessment are discussed with AEC practitioners. The
   method was tested in two case studies: a prestige tourist cottage and a
   multifamily residential building. Different superstructures, insulation
   materials and windows were varied for the cottage's envelope whilst
   evaluating life-cycle energy and cost. In addition, the environmental
   impact in terms of CO2 emissions was evaluated for the initial and
   optimal design suggestions for the two different superstructures. For
   the residential building, the insulation material thickness and the
   windows were varied for its evaluation of life-cycle energy and cost.
   For the cottage, a report was written and then read by the practitioners
   and used as a base for future decisions. For the residential building,
   the results were presented orally for the practitioners. In both cases,
   it was possible to communicate the overarching results of the
   optimizations through visual plots, although future research should find
   ways to also explain the detailed results. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Title = {Stakeholders' perspectives on BIM and LCA for green buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {There is growing concern about the environmental impacts of buildings on
   climate change. In this regard, the concept of integrating building
   technologies and environmental assessment methods, namely Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), has arisen
   as an innovative approach to improve building environmental assessment
   at the design phase. Recent studies made attempts to develop theoretical
   frameworks for BIM and LCA integration focusing on the technical aspects
   and the challenges of this integration. However, the stakeholders'
   perspectives on this integration of BIM and LCA for building
   environmental assessment have been overlooked. Therefore, there is a
   pressing need to understand the stakeholders' perspectives on BIM and
   LCA and their value for improving green building design and assessment.
   This study contributes to the existing knowledge on the potential
   implementation of an integrated BIM-LCA framework for building
   environmental assessment. To this end, this study investigates (1) the
   current applications of BIM and LCA in green buildings from the
   stakeholders' perspectives and (2) the stakeholders' level of awareness
   and agreement on the significance of BIM and LCA for green building
   design and assessment. In order to achieve this goal, a national survey
   was conducted among multiple stakeholders in the New Zealand building
   industry. The results indicate that BIM and LCA applications for green
   buildings are still immature. A statistically significant correlation is
   observed between the importance of BIM and LCA applications for green
   buildings. The stakeholders perceive BIM and LCA potentials and their
   integration positively. However, the current practices and applications
   of BIM and LCA do not align with the stakeholders' perceptions. Massive
   efforts are still required for a wide implementation of BIM and LCA and
   their potential integration for green buildings.},

Abstract = {BIM is increasingly getting into the awareness in construction industry.
   BIM is the process of creating and data managing of the building during
   its life cycle. BIM became a part of management tools in modern
   construction companies. Construction projects have a number of
   participants. It means difficulty process of construction project
   management and a serious requirement for processing the huge amount of
   information including design, construction, time and cost parameters,
   economic efficiency and sustainability. Progressive information and
   communication technologies support cost management and management of
   construction project. One of them is Building Information Modelling. Aim
   of the paper is to examine the impact of BIM exploitation and benefits
   on construction project management in Slovak companies.},

   infrastructures and uses of BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-16},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the conditions of the
   building information modelling (BIM) implementation in facility
   management (FM) specifically from the point of view of different groups
   of FM practitioners, and the FM infrastructures already in use.
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review on the gap between the
   uses of BIM in design and FM has been done. The key professional groups
   of FM in the Premises Centre of the City of Helsinki were interviewed on
   the information tools they use, and the needs and impediments of the BIM
   implementation in the FM. Cultural-historical activity theory is used as
   a theoretical framework.
   Findings - The literature discussing the BIM implementation tends to
   omit the analysis of the existing FM information systems and software
   tools in use. The challenge in the BIM implementation is in which ways
   the relevant information included in the BIM models could be integrated
   with these systems. No well-articulated problems or developmental
   contradictions came up that would demand the investment in the BIM
   implementation.
   Practical implications - The results call for experimenting with
   incremental implementation of BIM in different FM activities and in the
   FM information infrastructures in use.
   Originality/value - This paper studies empirically different FM
   activities and information systems used by the professional groups. Such
   studies are needed for a realistic view of the potential integration of
   the BIM information to the FM information systems.},

Title = {Sustainability Assessment of a Low-Income Building: A
   BIM-LCSA-FAHP-Based Analysis},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The construction industry is one of the most significant consumers of
   environmental resources worldwide. Faced with the need to produce new
   buildings, but without further burdening the environment, attempts to
   improve social, economic, and environmental indicators have turned
   attention to building construction in recent decades. The objective of
   this research is to develop a novel framework to assess the most
   sustainable choice of materials applied to the construction of
   low-income buildings, according to the three pillars of the Triple
   Bottom Line (TBL). A BIM-LCSA-FAHP-based model was proposed with the
   creation of nine different scenarios, where the materials of the
   structure (precast concrete, cast-in-place concrete, and structural
   masonry), painting (PVA water-based and acrylic), and roofing (ceramic
   and fiber cement tiles) varied. The proposed procedure consists of the
   elaboration of a 3D Building Information Modeling (BIM) model, for which
   the parameters described above were evaluated according to the Life
   Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA)-TBL-based criteria, divided into
   ten sub-criteria, that includes: (1) environmental (acidification,
   eutrophication, global warming, ozone depletion, smog formation, primary
   energy, non-renewable energy, and mass total), (2) economic
   (construction cost) and (3) socio-political issues (community impact).
   Finally, the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used as a
   multi-criteria decision-making technique that helps in aggregating and
   classifying the impacts of each scenario in a sustainability index (SI).
   Regarding the best option for low-income construction, the results
   indicated that precast concrete when combined with acrylic paint and
   fiber cement tiles (scenario 3) proved to be the most advantageous and
   achieved first place in the sustainability index (SI) developed in this
   work. This methodology is replicable for different construction
   typologies and several categories of materials, making it a robust
   decision-aiding tool for engineers, architects, and decision makers.},

Title = {Visual tool for sustainable buildings: A design approach with various
   data visualisation techniques},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {To tackle sustainability, the building sector has to take into account
   the life cycle impacts of buildings. However, due to the complexity of
   life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC), architects
   still have a huge hurdle to integrate LCA and LCC in their design
   processes and even more in the first design stage where the most
   important decisions are taken. To overcome the complexity, this research
   aims to develop a comprehensive visual approach in line with an
   architectural design process. Firstly, environmental impacts are
   translated into cost so that they can be integrated with financial cost
   in a life cycle costing approach. Secondly, various visualisations of
   this single unit result are selected, and a visual approach is
   elaborated, which supports an integration of life cycle approach in a
   design process. This paper demonstrates via a theoretical simplified
   case of dwellings in the Belgian context how the approach can support
   making more desirable design decisions. The proposed approach with a
   combined use of visualisations can be expected to enable architects
   integrating LCA and LCC results in their design loop thinking and easily
   overview the effect of their design decisions for sustainable dwellings.},

   Statistical Perspective},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The integration of building information modelling (BIM) and geographic
   information system (GIS) in construction management is a new and fast
   developing trend in recent years, from research to industrial practice.
   BIM has advantages on rich geometric and semantic information through
   the building life cycle, while GIS is a broad field covering
   geovisualization-based decision making and geospatial modelling.
   However, most current studies of BIM-GIS integration focus on the
   integration techniques but lack theories and methods for further data
   analysis and mathematic modelling. This paper reviews the applications
   and discusses future trends of BIM-GIS integration in the architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry based on the studies of 96
   high-quality research articles from a spatio-temporal statistical
   perspective. The analysis of these applications helps reveal the
   evolution progress of BIM-GIS integration. Results show that the
   utilization of BIM-GIS integration in the AEC industry requires
   systematic theories beyond integration technologies and deep
   applications of mathematical modeling methods, including spatio-temporal
   statistical modeling in GIS and 4D/nD BIM simulation and management.
   Opportunities of BIM-GIS integration are outlined as three hypotheses in
   the AEC industry for future research on the in-depth integration of BIM
   and GIS. BIM-GIS integration hypotheses enable more comprehensive
   applications through the life cycle of AEC projects.},

   MODELLING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) captures numerous information the
   life cycle of buildings. Information retrieval is one of fundamental
   tasks for BIM decision support systems. Currently, most of the BIM
   retrieval systems focused on querying existing BIM models from a BIM
   database, seldom studies explore the multi-scale information retrieval
   from a BIM model. This study proposes a multi-scale information
   retrieval scheme for BIM jointly using the hierarchical structure of BIM
   and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Firstly, a BIM Hierarchy Tree
   (BIH-Tree) model is constructed to interpret the hierarchical structure
   relations among BIM data according to Industry Foundation Class (IFC)
   specification. Secondly, technologies of NLP and International Framework
   for Dictionaries (IFD) are employed to parse and unify the queries.
   Thirdly, a novel information retrieval scheme is developed to find the
   multi-scale information associated with the unified queries. Finally,
   the retrieval method proposed in this study is applied to an engineering
   case, and the practical results show that the proposed method is
   effective.},

Title = {Assessing the usability of blockchain for sustainability: Extending key
   themes to the construction industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {343},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) emerged as an innovative computer
   technology capable of ensuring information security through encryption
   algorithms. In recent years, this technology has been discussed in
   different industries, including the construction sector. Although the
   advantages of applying DLT in construction projects are numerous,
   several barriers and limitations are associated with its application.
   The difficulties are even more exacerbated when examining the uses of
   DLT for achieving more sustainable buildings. In this context, this
   article conducts a comprehensive literature review on blockchain, the
   most discussed DLT technology nowadays, for sustainability, focusing on
   extending key applications discussed in various fields to the
   construction industry and real estate. The novelty of this review paper
   is the presentation of an in-depth discussion of what the next steps in
   blockchain research should be in order to integrate its applications for
   achieving a sustainable construction environment with cleaner production
   and resource use efficiency. A conceptual framework is also proposed to
   showcase the integration of blockchain with other applications for
   facilitating the goal of achieving sustainable buildings, including
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Sustainability
   Assessment (LCSA).},

Title = {Digital Twin Aided Vulnerability Assessment and Risk-Based Maintenance
   Planning of Bridge Infrastructures Exposed to Extreme Conditions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Over the past centuries, millions of bridge infrastructures have been
   constructed globally. Many of those bridges are ageing and exhibit
   significant potential risks. Frequent risk-based inspection and
   maintenance management of highway bridges is particularly essential for
   public safety. At present, most bridges rely on manual inspection
   methods for management. The efficiency is extremely low, causing the
   risk of bridge deterioration and defects to increase day by day,
   reducing the load-bearing capacity of bridges, and restricting the
   normal and safe use of them. At present, the applications of digital
   twins in the construction industry have gained significant momentum and
   the industry has gradually entered the information age. In order to
   obtain and share relevant information, engineers and decision makers
   have adopted digital twins over the entire life cycle of a project, but
   their applications are still limited to data sharing and visualization.
   This study has further demonstrated the unprecedented applications of
   digital twins to sustainability and vulnerability assessments, which can
   enable the next generation risk-based inspection and maintenance
   framework. This study adopts the data obtained from a constructor of
   Zhongcheng Village Bridge in Zhejiang Province, China as a case study.
   The applications of digital twins to bridge model establishment,
   information collection and sharing, data processing, inspection and
   maintenance planning have been highlighted. Then, the integration of
   ``digital twins (or Building Information Modelling, BIM) + bridge risk
   inspection model{''} has been established, which will become a more
   effective information platform for all stakeholders to mitigate risks
   and uncertainties of exposure to extreme weather conditions over the
   entire life cycle.},

Title = {Carbon emission reduction in prefabrication construction during
   materialization stage: A BIM-based life-cycle assessment approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {723},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Prefabrication has gained its popularity in countries including China
   due to its various advantages such as quality control, waste reduction,
   onsite and offsite parallel coordination, and so on. It has also been
   recognized as a key strategy to reduce construction-induced carbon
   emissions. However, there is limited research to examine carbon emission
   reduction in prefabrication by using the advanced technological
   artefacts, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), emerging from the
   technology sphere. As a digital representation of a facility, BIM
   provides a cyber platform based on which many assessment and simulation
   works can be performed without having to construct the physical
   facility. This paper aims to develop a BIM-based approach to measuring
   carbon emission reduction during the materialization stage of a
   prefabricated building project. Findings from the study indicate that
   BIM is an efficient and effective method for measuring carbon emissions
   from the construction of new buildings and that prefabrication reduces
   carbon emissions when compared with conventional construction methods.
   The research contributes to the body of knowledge relating to the
   reduction of carbon emissions through prefabrication. This is pertinent
   to contractors, homebuyers and governments who are constantly seeking
   ways to achieve a circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Life cycle costing is the technique of considering the initial and
   subsequent running costs and residual costs of an asset over the life of
   a project. Running costs are defined as the total cost of operations and
   maintenance costs of a building. The technique is accepted to be of
   theoretical merit but its practical development is hindered by two
   extreme factors i) the absence of data in the right form and ii)
   difficulties in handling the plethora of data when exists.
   This paper describes the use of a novel approach, known as the
   cost-significance. for the development of simple models for running and
   maintenance costs in buildings. The models focus design and management
   effort on the high cost items. The results art drawn from analysis of
   operation and maintenance costs for university buildings over a period
   of 18 years demonstrating the feasibility of deriving a small number of
   items, 16\% of the total number of items occurring in running costs and
   30\% in maintenance costs, which consistently represent some 87\% of the
   total running costs of buildings and 70\% of the total maintenance
   costs. The model can calculate the costs to an average accuracy of
   +/-5\% and +/-13\% for total running and maintenance costs respectively.
   The models were tested on new information and proved to be effective and
   consistent.
   The paper also discusses the major applications of the developed
   methodology and models particularly considering data collection,
   recording and analysis for use in life cycle costing applications in
   buildings.},

Abstract = {Sustainability is known as one of today's major goals, including all
   areas of life. Urbanism is the leading soul of our lives in work,
   housing, education, and open spaces. We experience urban patterns all
   day long through different steps (design, structure, environmental
   behavior, life cycle). Sustainable urban planning is a newtrend that has
   emerged in recent decades and has become part of the design of some
   architects, helping to protect the environment and save resources.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an excellent achievement for the
   building, engineering, and construction industries as a fantastic
   arrangement of execution equipment configurations and is of great
   interest throughout the structural life cycle. The incredible impact of
   BIM shifted not only construction efficiency but also information that
   supports current and future urban growth, improving quality of life and
   contributing to the growth of the country's economy. In addition,
   Sustainable Urban Planning focused on promoting the long-term survival
   of cities by reducing consumption, waste, harmful effects on people and
   places, and improving overall health. Another trend to consider cities
   and practices for building cities (urbanism) is the study of how
   inhabitants of urban areas, such as towns and cities, interact with the
   built environment. Building Information Modelling (BIM) mechanisms
   applied at the city planning level help provide comprehensive data for
   guiding and improving the sustainability of cities, which is Urban
   Information Modelling (CIM). This will involve optimizing the demand for
   new buildings, infrastructure, and services through, for example,
   considering users' needs, both building and the wider community. It will
   also influence the broader supply of buildings and infrastructure by
   seeking greater efficiency and effectiveness. This paper aims to present
   an invented vision towards an interactive connection between (CIM) and
   Sustainable Urbanism to enhance the quality of life and city livability.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE LA CONSTRUCCION},

Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-177},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Construction worldwide is under great pressure to generate significant
   changes in the sector. A significant change requires a multidimensional
   vision that integrates different perspectives, promoting a deep
   knowledge of the constructive process and it's parallel with
   manufacturing as a comparative basis. For the specific case of the
   construction of reinforced concrete in seismic zones, it is proposed to
   move from the division of labor by specialties to the division of labor
   by spatial volumes, which considers the functional and systemic
   perspectives. This is proposed in order to characterize the life cycles
   of the different systems within a building, guaranteeing a high level of
   sustainability. To achieve this objective, a real high-rise building
   project with its respective BIM model will be used as a basis for the
   construction of another twin BIM model (mirror) that will use design
   criteria that meet the objectives of this proposal. It will use the
   original model data and the information obtained from the monitoring of
   the project execution phase. This proposal will present, in a
   comparative way, this strategy's impact on the design and execution of
   the real project in which the installations are completely
   disincorporated from the structure, emulating the simile of an assembly
   line. It is expected that the results will demonstrate that an evident
   improvement in sustainability is achieved by making the different
   systems of a building independent, allowing the life cycle of each
   system to maximized. This independence, in turn, generates the
   conditions for a substantial improvement in productivity. On the other
   hand, the integration of engineering with the construction of functional
   solutions off-site allows for a significant improvement in
   constructability, in addition to externalities that can only be
   characterized in the exploitation phase. This will allow a radical
   change in the supply market, transferring an important amount of
   knowledge towards the sector. This experience will generate outstanding
   leadership in the sector and a categorical emphasis in the direction of
   innovation.},

Title = {Dynamic Modeling for Life Cycle Cost Analysis of BIM-Based Construction
   Waste Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Recent studies in construction waste and management (CWM) have mainly
   investigated the waste management chain from a static perspective and
   failed to take into account the dynamic nature of parameters and their
   correlation. In addition, the current studies of building information
   modeling (BIM)-based CWM failed to analyze the cost-benefits due to the
   lack of numerical economic benchmarks. To address the gap, this study
   developed a system dynamic (SD) model to analyze the economic aspects of
   construction and demolition (C\&D) waste from using BIM. Causal loop and
   stock-flow diagrams are modeled based on the determined variables and
   their interrelationships. Standard sensitivity tests were then performed
   to establish the validity of the model under real system conditions.
   Different scenarios were applied to simulate and compare the model
   results in response to various policies. A case study was conducted to
   quantify the costs and the profits. Based on the comparison with the
   conventional approach and BIM-based method, BIM can reduce CWM cost by
   up to 57\%. The findings also indicated that higher landfill charges
   will not be able to motivate managers to use sustainable CWM;
   conversely, increasing the modularity of design and earlier realization
   of net benefits will incentivize project managers to employ BIM-based
   CWM.},

Title = {Multi-information integration-based life cycle analysis of greenhouse
   gas emissions for prefabricated construction: A case study of Shenzhen},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global
   construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time,
   improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It
   is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However,
   there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced
   technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in
   prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi
   -information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG
   emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the
   production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The
   results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for
   the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77
   kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively,
   with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated
   components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest
   share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11\%, while the transportation
   and construction phases contribute 3.30\% and 0.59\% of the total
   emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of pre-fabricated
   construction can lead to a 31.62\% reduction in total GHG emissions per
   square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to
   traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study
   contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for
   calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of
   GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings.
   These findings can serve as practical references for future research to
   achieve the construction industry's green and low -carbon goals.},

   of execution, logistics and logistics. Information support defines the
   basis of the information technology application platform. The life cycle
   of any building object is extremely informationally saturated. With the
   introduction of innovative materials and technologies, with the
   connection of a large number of process participants at different
   stages, more information is required for prompt decision-making,
   pressure on time and resources is increasing. The distribution of
   information flows along the stages of the life cycle of a construction
   site, its spread over time and among the involved specialists is the
   main task of information support, on the basis of which the
   effectiveness of operational management is increased by building an

Abstract = {The recent emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the latest
   technological innovations and the widespread use and embrace of Building
   Information Models (BIMs) offer several new ideas and decision-making
   capabilities throughout the life cycle of the built environment. The
   ability to connect and monitor data from sensor networks remotely in
   real time as well as the simulation and optimization of engineering
   systems, have led to the emergence of the Digital Twin (DT) concept of
   the structured environment. Although BIM lacks semantic completeness in
   areas beyond the scope of building modelling such as control systems,
   cadastral systems, networking of sensors, meteorological networks, etc.,
   the DTs aim to achieve the synchronization of big data from various
   sources and simulate the real world into a virtual platform for the
   seamless management and control of the construction process, facility
   management, environmental monitoring, disaster management and disaster
   prevention, and other life cycle processes within the built environment.
   DTs in the built environment are still in nascent stages and thus a more
   in-depth investigation is required to explore and establish the best
   practices and technologies to serve this evolution. In this paper, we
   propose a methodology for providing the DT of a building; by crossing
   from the BIM static world to the dynamic cyber-world of DTs. A practical
   application is implemented for a two-storey `smart' building with sensor
   systems installed in its assets and in the surrounding landscape area.
   As the practical experiment is successfully completed, we conclude that
   such an endeavour can actually be achieved at building level offering
   several economic, environmental and social benefits.},

Abstract = {In this study, several developed models have been adopted to investigate
   deterioration induced by chloride ingress by considering uncertainty in
   order to estimate the initiation and rate of corrosion. Besides, the
   structural capacity and serviceability of RC buildings, i.e. the shear
   capacity, bending strength and width of cracking or spalling of columns
   and beams with corroded reinforcing bars, were also calculated using
   simple formulas developed from previous experiments. Based on the
   information of annual spalling/cracking and failure probabilities, the
   deterioration risk of an RC building attacked by chloride can be
   evaluated using the concept of reliability of a series system. In order
   to find the optimal maintenance plan, probabilistic effect assessment
   models for repair/retrofit strategies (five repair/retrofit strategies
   were selected) that consider the recurrence of deterioration in repaired
   areas and the deterioration proceeding in unrepaired areas were
   developed in this research. These models reflect the effects of the
   maintenance strategies on the failure and spalling probability directly
   and can be used to estimate the life-cycle performance and cost of RC
   buildings. Finally, on the basis of the minimal life-cycle cost, the
   optimal life-cycle maintenance strategy can also be identified by using
   the genetic algorithm; case studies were used to discuss the
   applicability of this system.},

   BUILDINGS - AN APPLICATION FOR CONCRETE STRUCTURES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {40-57},
Abstract = {: The construction industry has a great impact on the environment,
   therefore sustainable construction presents itself as a growing
   requirement of society. However, the concern with green buildings must
   not only be considered during the construction stage, but also during
   the entire life cycle of the building, integrating all stages from the
   design up until the demolition. Ensuring that the information permeates
   this lifecycle without data losses is vital. This way, efficient
   interoperability can support sustainability, allowing data to feed the
   process, and promoting the creation of more sustainable buildings. BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) arises as a means to support
   interoperability improvements in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction) industry, by sharing models through open formats and
   enabling communication amongst actors. This paper presents a framework
   for BIM interoperability, with the goal to support knowledge
   organization and aid users in the decisionmaking processes. It will
   allow users to track sustainability concepts throughout the entire green
   BIM lifecycle and to improve processes in the construction industry
   toward more interoperable processes, minimizing data loss, and improving
   communication and efficiency. The framework is presented through process
   mapping techniques to analyze and integrate sustainability concepts
   using BIM throughout the lifecycle of a building. This framework
   considers not only data interoperability but also other aspects such as
   process, business, and service interoperability. Also, an application of
   the framework is described, using the case of cast-in-place concrete
   structures. Research findings identified the critical data points in the
   lifecycle of concrete structures which can influence sustainability},

Title = {How Different Tools Contribute to Climate Change Mitigation in a
   Circular Building Environment?-A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The circular economy (CE) has become a trend because concern has arisen
   regarding the end of life of several products and the reduction of CO2
   emissions in many processes. Since the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry is one of the biggest generators of
   environmental impacts, there is a need to apply the CE concept to the
   industry in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the
   role of different tools that are used to integrate CE strategies to
   reduce GHG emissions by the AEC industry is still unknown in the
   scientific literature. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a
   systematic literature review on the theme and analyze the following
   seven tools: (1) life cycle assessment-LCA; (2) building information
   modeling-BIM; (3) building environmental certifications-BEC; (4)
   building materials passports-BMP; (5) waste management plan-WMP; (6)
   augmented reality-AR; and (7) virtual reality-VR. A total of 30 papers
   were reviewed, and it was observed that, in terms of CE strategies and
   climate change mitigation, the vast majority can be classified as
   closing loops and are mainly related to recycling and reuse at the end
   of life and the use of recycled materials. Considering the building's
   stakeholders, constructors, researchers, and designers can be the main
   users and, consequently, those that most benefit from the use of the
   evaluated tools. The integration between LCA, BIM, and BMP was also
   observed. Finally, as one of the main contributions of this research,
   other types of integration among the analyzed tools are proposed. These
   proposals seek to improve and update the tools and also address the need
   to reduce GHG emissions.},

Abstract = {Owners and construction management are in permanent search to increase
   competitiveness, reduce cost and time and maintain a high quality of
   products and services. In this objective project management tend to
   organize work execution by implementing comprehensive, linked and
   sequential processes, making full use of every work effort and limiting
   work duplication and rework. Since the `90s, the 3D-modeling is used to
   coordinate, plan, build and manage future structures. The BIM approach
   proposes to stakeholders to participate in an intelligent centrally
   shared 3D-model making use of every contribution to this model,
   facilitating the coordination, solving the interfaces, reducing
   duplication efforts and carrying the developed data information
   throughout the life cycle of the structure and beyond the construction
   phase. Completing a complex structure requires an important level of
   design management and coordination of the interface between architect,
   designer, mechanic, electrician, and other designers. Basic input is
   required from equipment suppliers. Now, for a good reason, everyone in
   charge of the process is focused on achieving their process with less
   cost and less time. Thus, he inadvertently reduces the effort associated
   with surrounding or subsequent actions, and focuses on his main result.
   For example, structural engineering developing a 3D-model will focus on
   clean structural design focusing on structural continuity, geometry
   identification, and calculation model for finite elements of software.
   Likewise, a mechanical engineer will model plumbing and mechanical
   networks for fabrication and installation purposes. It is the same with
   other design disciplines.},

Title = {Comparing the life cycle costs of a traditional and a smart HVAC control
   system for Australian office buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Many smart technologies have been introduced in buildings with the aim
   to reduce the energy and GHG emissions associated with their operation,
   particularly through improved control systems for regulating heating,
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Despite their energy
   saving potential, only a few studies have comprehensively assessed the
   costs associated with their practical implementation from a life cycle
   perspective. Accordingly, this study quantifies and compares the life
   cycle costs of a smart HVAC control system with that of a traditional
   control system, in the context of an Australian office building. For
   both systems, the required hardware are specified based on the
   characteristics of these systems and the layout of the serviced spaces
   in the reference building. The costs incurred over the period of
   assessment are quantified using the net present cost (NPC) approach. To
   evaluate the effects of these control systems on the operational energy
   costs of the building HVAC system, the control logics of both these
   systems are modelled through building energy simulations. The results
   show that, over the period of assessment, the smart control system
   incurred a higher total cost compared to the traditional control system.
   However, the findings from the simulations show that the HVAC energy
   cost savings achieved through the specification of the smart control
   system offset the additional cost incurred to deploy this system over
   the traditional control system. The smart control system resulted in
   HVAC operational cost savings between 9 \% and 10 \% compared to the
   traditional control system. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the
   total life cycle costs varied between -27 \% and +50 \%, with the
   discount rate and energy price increase rate being the most influential
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling - attribution of the specialized model
   subsoil The BMVI's ``Stufenplan{''} has made the use of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) mandatory for public infrastructure projects
   from 2020 onward, however this requirement is not yet fully met in
   practice. In the BIM-based planning process, the geotechnical expert
   creates the specialized model subsoil. This article takes an approach to
   its structure based on submodels and their content. The focus is on the
   presentation of the relevant steps for finding a target-oriented and
   BIM-compliant attribution, considering the special features of the
   specialized model. For this purpose, its life cycle and the special
   features compared to other specialized models are illuminated. A
   proposal for dealing with soil-structure interaction in the
   BIM-supported planning process is presented. Finally, the necessity of
   attribute catalogs is discussed and ideas for their design are
   presented.},

Abstract = {The growth and operation of the Chinese housing stock has caused

   inventory data of building materials, being timing consuming and losing
   original building components' information. A BIM-LCA framework is
   presented in which the information of all assembles and materials are
   deduced from BIM as input data for the LCA \& LCC model. The framework
   enables a dynamic process of optimization and evaluation of the project,
   and helps to integrate ecological and economic analysis. A high-rise
   residential building in Tianjin is analyzed. The results demonstrate
   that the BIM-LCA model is an effective tool, and that the calculation
   method based on building assemblies is more appropriate for optimization

   environmental performance over the whole design process},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {246},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This study is built upon two previous articles which focus on
   identifying the key design variables affecting the life-cycle
   environmental impacts in each design stage of the building design
   process. This research aims to investigate the trade-offs between
   embodied and operational impacts and explore potential reduction in the
   total environmental impacts of a building by varying the identified
   design variables in each stage of the design process. A multi-objective
   optimization model based on BIM and LCA integration has been developed
   to find out the design solution with the optimal trade-offs between the
   embodied and operational impacts and the option with the minimal
   environmental impacts. Applying the proposed model to a mid-rise
   residential building, the results showed that the design process has the
   potential to lower the environmental impacts of the building by
   approximately 47.6 \%. Moreover, the potential for reducing carbon
   emissions is greater in the early design stages, with the potential to
   lower emissions by up to 32.5 \%, compared to the lower emission
   reduction potential of approximately 7.5 \% in the detailed and
   construction design stages. Furthermore, solutions aimed at addressing
   the trade-off between embodied and operational impacts were identified
   in each design stage. The study provides an insight into the
   understanding of how building design can be optimized to mitigate
   envi-ronmental impacts.},

Abstract = {Architects largely define the environmental impact a building will cause
   throughout its lifetime in early design stages. Therefore, Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) would be ideally used to optimize the environmental
   performance in these stages. Conventional LCA tools based on BIM require
   detailed information only available in detailed design stages when it is
   too late for major changes. Therefore, a novel tool based on simple 3D
   models and a parametric LCA method is developed. The cloud-based tool
   called CAALA is designed as a plug-in for 3D CAD software and provides
   the results in real-time. The applicability of this early-BIM approach
   is validated using three case studies, each highlighting different
   aspects. The results show that CAALA provides meaningful information to
   architects and clients, is easy to learn, and applicable in early design
   with a reasonable effort. Finally, it can be concluded that holistic
   environmental performance optimization in the most important early
   design stages is now practically feasible.},

Abstract = {The horizontal roofs of industrial buildings are the weakest part of a
   structure. Imperfect design of horizontal roofs causes roof leakage. For
   roofs with a large surface area, locating leakage points is very
   difficult. The problem is solved by aerial thermography using drones.
   Modern high-resolution thermal cameras make it possible to detect roof
   leaks. By processing the RGB camera and thermal camera data, a thermal
   mesh model is created for implementation into the BIM. Building
   information models are data managers throughout the life cycle of
   buildings. BIM helps prevent clashes, improve collaboration and record
   building information from IOT devices. For building maintenance, the
   results of thermography need to be implemented in BIM. BIM managers
   create a roof repair plan based on the severity of the roof leakage.
   This paper proposes a methodology to implement the results of roof leak
   detection, starting from data collection and continuing with the
   processing of geometric and thermographic data and finalizes with
   implementation.},

Abstract = {In order to continue to deliver high quality service while meeting the
   goals expected of them, asset managers are increasingly required to
   utilize advances like advanced information management systems, automated
   data collection, and the integration of a range of data types. Through a
   review of asset management systems and research undertaken into its use
   in building design organizations in South-East Queensland, Australia,
   the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for life cycle
   sustainable asset management is discussed. The results of this research
   indicate that while there has been development of BIM and other advanced
   information systems in asset management, further work is required to
   fully achieve the potential for using these systems. Options for better
   facilitating this process include improved sharing of BIM models,
   interoperability between systems, improved training and having an Open
   BIM approach to facilitate its development},

   a Content Analysis of the GC21 Contract},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION ECONOMICS AND BUILDING},
Year = {2015},

Pages = {72-84},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is seen as a panacea to many of the
   ills confronting the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   sector. In spite of its well documented benefits the widespread
   integration of BIM into the project lifecycle is yet to occur. One
   commonly identified barrier to BIM adoption is the perceived legal risks
   associated with its integration, coupled with the need for
   implementation in a collaborative environment. Many existing
   standardised contracts used in the Australian AEC industry were drafted
   before the emergence of BIM. As BIM continues to become ingrained in the
   delivery process the shortcomings of these existing contracts have
   become apparent. This paper reports on a study that reviewed and
   consolidated the contractual and legal concerns associated with BIM
   implementation. The findings of the review were used to conduct a
   qualitative content analysis of the GC21 2nd edition, an Australian
   standardised construction contract, to identify possible changes to
   facilitate the implementation of BIM in a collaborative environment. The
   findings identified a number of changes including the need to adopt a
   collaborative contract structure with equitable risk and reward
   mechanisms, recognition of the model as a contract document and the need
   for standardisation of communication/ information exchange.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming more and more
   state-of-the-art in the construction and real estate industries.
   Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) has a major part in this
   field. The quality of MEP in the planning and the construction phase of
   a building is crucial for energy consumption and human comfort within
   the building. To benefit from the advantages of the BIM methodology, a
   high-quality data model is needed to ensure the availability of
   necessary information of a complete life cycle of a building. The
   Austrian research project metaTGA provides solutions for high-quality
   data models. The paper will provide information about: how do MEP
   openBIM data models need to look like? What are the major development
   steps of these models? How are they applied in a BIM project including
   first practical feedback? How does the process support quality measures
   for BIM projects?},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the construction industry's significant impact on high
   energy use and a growing carbon footprint, technologies like Green BIM
   help to optimize natural resources, reduce pollution, use sustainable
   space and work on human comfort and health. But the trend in a holistic
   approach is minimal. Thus, the paper aimed to systematically investigate
   Green BIM research and implementation trends using a mixed-method and
   also show the prospects of holistic Green BIM implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach First, we conducted a Scientometrics
   analysis on the topic using the Scopus database for the time interval of
   (2013-present). Secondly, the Qualitative Content Review method asserted
   the Scientometrics analysis result. Lastly, exploratory research was
   done on secondary data to compare the AEC industry trend for a
   comprehensive view. Findings The merged findings confirmed the partial
   implementation of Green BIM and of which 43\% of research focused only
   on energy analysis. Despite the potential of BIM and the
   interrelationship among green building parameters, the result showed
   other aspects of green building and sustainable design parameters as
   green material selection, sustainable site, waste management and
   water-use efficiency not comprised. Originality/value The authors
   propose a new conceptual framework for integrating green building
   parameters, BIM tools and green building assessment tools in a life
   cycle of a project that adds into the sustainability of the
   Architectural, Engineering and Construction sector. The study would help
   to provoke researchers, software developers and practitioners for
   further innovative effort in holistic Green BIM implementation.},

Abstract = {For the last decade, the focus on sustainability has increased
   significantly. In the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction
   industry (AEC), the focus of sustainability is on making a Life Cycle
   Analysis (LCA) on the different building components. Research indicates
   that the collaboration between disciplines is limited because of human
   linguistic failure in BIM models. This research aims to bring forth the
   principles of mapping data with fuzzy logic algorithms and show the
   application in a practical collaborative context. With the application
   of Design Science Research methodology, this research will create an
   artifact in Dynamo for Revit, with the implementation of fuzzy logic
   algorithms for mapping LCA data from LCAbyg, is an LCA-program used in
   the danish AEC industry, and the linguistic data from a BIM model. The
   research shows that the implementation of a fuzzy logic system is an
   effective tool for mapping data. The result of the prototype concludes
   that fuzzy logic algorithms with ease can be used in a collaborative
   context. The study implies that the AEC industry's linguistic difference
   and purity are a limitation on using fuzzy logic algorithms. The
   research also indicates that the fuzzy logic algorithm used in parallel
   constellation may cause bad results, and the relegation or exclusion of
   different algorithms should be investigated. The research also shows
   that the linguistic deficiencies in LCAbyg concerning the applied
   linguistic of the industry have a significant implication on fuzzy
   logic.},

Abstract = {This study proposes an approach for conducting comparative assessments
   between renovation and new construction through the use of CIB utility
   theory systems and applies the methodology to an adaptive case study. To
   this end, the theoretical underpinnings of CIB were explained in the
   literature review, and the method of data analysis, selection of
   usability functions, and standard condition assessment scale were
   explained. The proposed model can be used to evaluate CIB utility theory
   systems and for life-cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). The current
   findings revealed that the maintenance planning system and 5 G
   information must be improved because they are the key to Taiwan's future
   development. Considering that the aim of cost-optimal maintenance and
   renovation planning is to not only optimise the service life-cycle costs
   of building components but also to maintain appropriate conditions and
   the performance of the respective components, the model used in this
   study prioritises performance over cost. Therefore, proposals are made
   for the future development of LCSA considering stakeholders of various
   projects for new construction by enhancing objectivity and
   accessibility.},

Abstract = {Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) can be efficiently used to quantify
   wind-induced damage on a tall building. The LCCA selects an
   ``optimal{''} design solution by minimizing over structural lifetime the
   total cost (construction, maintenance and repair). Being based on the
   Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research equation, the LCCA relates the
   expected cost over the lifetime of the structure to the probability of
   exceeding specific damage levels. It also accounts for potential sources
   of uncertainty, such as variability in wind load intensity,
   directionality, structural properties, damage model estimation, etc.
   This paper proposes a LCCA methodology that evolves from the approach
   used in seismic engineering to numerically examine non-structural damage
   probability and predict maintenance costs on tall buildings by
   incorporating information on aerodynamic loads measured on a reduced
   scale model in wind tunnel. The final objective is to provide an
   efficient simulation procedure, which simultaneously accounts for
   stochastic characterization of wind load intensity and direction.},

Abstract = {The lack of seamless interoperability between building information
   modeling (BIM) and building energy modeling (BEM) has been a long-lived
   problem, which causes two main obstacles: (1) significant time and
   effort required in building design and energy modeling iterations and
   (2) limited opportunities for architects to optimize their design
   informed by BEM. A smooth model information transfer from BIM to BEM can
   significantly accelerate the BEM process since BEM-related information
   can be imported from BIM, rather than start from scratch. In the reverse
   direction, mapping BEM to BIM will provide better opportunities for
   BEM-informed design optimization and integration with generative design
   tools, allowing architects more opportunities to improve building
   designs towards energy efficiency, such as by geometry modifications. In
   this paper, the authors proposed a new methodology of developing
   computing technologies to automatically map BEM to BIM following the
   industry foundation classes (IFC) standard. The authors concluded that
   the reverse mapping automation from BEM to IFC can be achieved through
   the state-of-the-art Data-Driven Reverse Engineering Algorithm
   Development (D-READ) method, based on the invariant signatures of
   building objects. The developed algorithm was tested on a high-rise
   residential building model, and it achieved seamless and error-free
   model transformation. This builds a solid step towards enabling smooth
   bi-directional modeling workflows between BIM and BEM, and helps move
   the whole architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry
   beyond the fairly isolated design and BEM practices towards enabling
   more opportunities to benefit the buildings' life cycle from BEM.},

Title = {Understanding product lifecycle management and supporting systems},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {559-583},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study attempts to expand knowledge of product lifecycle
   management (PLM) and supporting systems. Its objective is threefold:
   first, to identify and assess the impact of two key PLM building blocks
   on new product performance. Second, to use the aforementioned PLM
   building blocks to highlight the distinctive nature of PLM and
   closed-loop PLM systems. Third, to demonstrate that the closed-loop PLM
   system provides more new product benefits than the PLM system and that
   the usage of the closed-loop PLM system is positively related to new
   product development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research hypotheses were tested on
   data collected from 87 manufacturers in the transportation equipment
   manufacturing industry in one Canadian province.
   Findings - The findings show that only ten manufacturers have adopted a
   closed-loop PLM system. As expected, the results show that the two key
   PLM building blocks, namely operational integration and information
   system (IS) usage, are positively related to new product development.
   Findings also show that the level of forward operational integration is
   similar in the closed-loop PLM system and in the PLM system, while the
   level of backward operational integration, the usage of the PLM system
   and new product development are higher in the closed-loop PLM system.
   Finally, the results demonstrate that the usage of the closed-loop PLM
   system is positively related to new product development.
   Originality/value - This contribution should give academics and
   practitioners alike a better understanding of the role and benefits of
   PLM and its supporting systems (the PLM system and the closed-loop PLM
   system).},

Title = {Life cycle impact assessment of desktop stereolithography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {244},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies are nowadays employed in industry
   and prototype production in a range of different fields. A number of
   investigations have shown potential reductions of environmental impacts
   through the use of redesigned 3d printed products, although accurate
   information about the production phase is often missing. Despite the
   wide diffusion of stereolithography, reliable and updated data
   quantifying impacts of this technology are not available. In particular,
   this kind of information is lacking for desktop-scale stereolithography,
   whose market is increasing rapidly.
   This paper proposes a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of bottom-up
   desktop stereolithography. The analysed system includes the phases of
   material production, transportation, transformation and post-processing.
   The functional unit of the assessment regards one printed part. To
   efficiently quantify the actual impacts, the study introduces as
   parameters the mass of the product to be manufactured, the mass of its
   supporting structures and the building time. This parametrisation allows
   for an easy integration of the proposed investigation for an extended
   cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of the manufactured part. The
   life-cycle model was developed for a bottom-up desktop stereolithography
   apparatus located in Italy. Analyses and evaluations of the role of the
   different life-cycle phases in the environmental impact have been
   carried out in a specific case study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {With the increasing focus on the carbon neutrality, the low -carbon
   building (LCB) has been adopted as a strategic objective, with more and
   more information technologies (ITs) applied to LCB, significantly
   improving their carbon reduction capacity and service level. The
   research related to low -carbon tunnels (LCTs) is still in the initial
   exploration stage. To address the gaps, insights are provided into
   developing LCT using emerging ITs to enable more socioeconomic and
   environmental benefits. The study reviews the literature on how ITs
   serve the life cycle of LCBs. The IT tools commonly employed in LCBs
   with their contributions, and the current barriers faced by ITs have
   been further sorted out. Finally, suggestions are provided for emerging
   IT applications in LCTs. In the context of civil informatics, this study
   promotes the working on LCTs with clear perspectives and required
   research gaps, thus facilitating intelligent and sustainable development

Abstract = {Building envelopes have a critical role in the sustainability of the
   construction sector. The goals of the current research are assessing the
   environmental impacts of typical exterior wall assemblies and presenting
   the best Iranian market option through taking account of both embodied
   and operational energy. Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) is used to
   determine the operating loads of each wall. Simapro, a life cycle
   assessment software, is applied for managing data on environmental
   impacts. The derived results demonstrate that human health is the most
   severe damage category for all the analyzed walls. Also, the end-of-life
   stage's environmental impact is insignificant compared to the production
   and use stages. Reducing carbon emissions has the highest priority, such
   that replacing 1 m2 of masonry brick wall (the worst option) with
   prefabricated extruded polystyrene (XPS) drywall (the best option) can
   result in saving 1257.85 kgCO2eq. The operational phase of the studied
   walls has a wide range of environmental impacts. Prefabricated Knauf
   drywall as well as prefabricated XPS drywall consumes less energy for
   the operating phase mainly due to providing sufficient quantity of
   isolations that leads to the better total environmental performance. In
   conclusion, it should be noted that the thermal performance of building
   materials should be given more attention.},

   mitigation strategies must focus on more than just operational energy.
   As current climate policies recommend, designers should consider the
   broader framework of environmental impacts characterizing the entire
   building lifecycle. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considers the mentioned
   aspects. Nevertheless, the complexity of LCA and the criticalities of
   related tools prevent the application of the approach during decisive
   early stages. Additionally, LCA allows the estimation of environmental
   issues, but fails to describe other dimensions of sustainability. The
   article proposes an evaluation method to support decision-making during
   the design of sustainable buildings. The method exploits the LCA tool
   and the assessment framework provided by a Green Sustainable Building
   Certification (Active House) integrated with BIM. The approach was
   applied and proven through a case study: a residential single-family
   building in northern Italy, comparing two technological options. The
   study confirmed the effectiveness of the multicriteria evaluation
   framework that, from the early design stage, can be used to measure the
   environmental impact of buildings alongside implications for the final
   users' comfort.},

Abstract = {Despite insufficient housing facilities, particularly in developing
   countries, construction systems are generally selected intuitively or
   based on conventional solutions sanctioned by practice. The present
   study aims to evaluate different options for the design of low-income
   housing in Brazil by integrating the life cycle assessment (LCA) into
   the decision-making process. To achieve this objective, three
   single-family projects with different construction systems were selected
   and analyzed. The most sustainable design was selected through the
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The considered parameters, which were
   obtained through a survey with professionals and customers, included
   cost, environmental impact, thermal comfort, construction time, and
   cultural acceptance. LCA and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) were
   performed with the frontier's system considering the cradle-to-gate
   cycle, which included the extraction of raw materials, manufacture of
   building materials, and housing construction. The projects were modelled
   using Autodesk Revit software with the Tally application for LCA
   evaluation. The results indicated that light steel frame houses present
   a better behavior than other conventional alternatives, and the
   integration of building information modelling with LCA and LCCA in the
   design phase can lead to the development of more sustainable houses.},

   Houses: Case Study in Uruguay},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Currently, Uruguay is developing several measures to reduce the
   environmental impact of human activities and CO2 emissions. In 2015 more
   than 90\% of electricity was produced by renewable sources. Despite this
   fact, the construction, transport, and building sectors are still
   responsible for more than 60\% of CO2 emissions. Reducing building
   environmental impacts is becoming an increasing challenge. Lifecycle
   assessment (LCA) is recognized as a method that can help to reduce the
   environmental impact of the building sector. The LCA can be used as an
   early-stage decision-making tool to assess design choices that impact
   the environment. The present paper developed a method based on LCA that
   integrates building information modeling (BIM) to assess building
   envelope alternatives. The method is validated by the application in a
   single-family house, which is the most popular typology, in Uruguay,
   considering three envelope alternatives including frequent and
   nonfrequent materials. Results focused on comparing the embodied
   impacts, transport, and operational energy consumptions of each
   scenario. The results show that the developed method can help during the
   building design process, especially when defining dimension and
   thickness of materials. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {41-52},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) and geographical information
   systems (GIS) provide digital representation of architectural and
   environmental entities. BIM focuses on micro-level representation of
   buildings themselves, and GIS provide macro-level representation of the
   external environments of buildings. Moreover, their combination can
   establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data
   integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the
   architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the
   digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS
   integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the
   status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies
   for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects,
   building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of
   BIM-GIS integration, namely, ``BIM leads and GIS supports{''}, ``GIS
   leads and BIM supports{''}, and ``BIM and GIS are equally involved{''},
   are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two
   technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for
   the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we
   underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms
   should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process
   of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for
   building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve
   its systematic integration and application to the urban built
   environment. This review can serve as a roadmap for researchers who
   focus on studies of BIM-GIS integration in the sustainable built
   environment.},

Abstract = {``Prefabrication and Modular Building{''} and ``BIM{''} were two major
   buzzwords in the industry of construction in 2017. If the Prefabrication
   and Modular Building refers to a revolution in building production, BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) {[}2] application will act as an
   important technical means to promote the revolution. BIM technology can
   be applied in the design, construction, operation and maintenance,
   demolition and other full life cycles of construction field. As a newly
   applied technology, BIM is able to digitally virtualize and
   informatively describe the elements of various buildings as well as
   achieve the collaborative design of information, the visual assembly,
   the interaction of engineering information and the simulation and
   verification of node connection. Prefabricated buildings can use BIM
   technology to integrate various industrial chains and realize an
   all-round information integration. In the era when the connection
   between industrial elements and informational elements becomes closer
   and closer, BIM technology will be integrated with the prefabricated
   buildings in a perfect way so as to promote the innovation and
   development of the construction industry and even overturn the
   traditional construction industry.},

   a building carbon emission calculation model and a building carbon
   emission factor database instance. Taking prefabricated construction
   projects as an example, it is compared with the traditional calculation
   method. The results show that the method can more accurately predict

Abstract = {Modern prefabricated building technology can save resources, shorten the
   construction period, improve quality, and reduce pollution and carbon
   emissions. This study investigated the carbon footprint of prefabricated
   con-crete composite (PCC) plates at the project materialization stage.
   The joint application of three techniques conducted data analysis and
   computation: (a) the life cycle assessment (LCA) method providing the
   overall conceptual framework, building information modeling (BIM)
   technology designing the PCC-plates and gener-ating the component list,
   and geographic information system (GIS) software computing the spatial
   distribution of carbon footprint. A holistic carbon footprint accounting
   model was established for PCC plates' three materiali-zation substages
   (component-production, transport-logistics, and
   construction-installation) to comprehensively evaluate their quantity
   and distribution of carbon emissions. A detailed case study was
   conducted to test the proposed method and verify empirical findings. The
   results indicated: (1) the maximum difference between cases amounted to
   92.72 kgCO2/m2; (2) the carbon intensity per unit height was about
   18,182.15 kgCO2/m, and the unit cost was about 8469.01 kgCO2/10,000
   Yuan; and (3) the prefabrication rate, carbon emission per unit area and
   per unit cost were significantly correlated, indicating quantitative
   contributions of using more PCC to carbon footprint reduction. This
   research can assess the carbon emission of PCC at different construction
   substages with a good confidence level. The findings can provide a
   policy reference for the government and the industry to promote and
   rationalize PCC use and offer the basis to reduce the carbon footprint
   and sustainability of pre-fabricated construction.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of urbanization generates building demolition that
   impacts the environment with building waste. This paper provides a
   method aiming at the deconstruction evaluation of building structures
   with the employment of image maximum laser scanning technology. A
   deconstruction evaluation model for deconstruction feasibility
   prediction indicates that the unique non-contact scanning technology can
   evaluate the deconstruction, improve the safety of deconstruction, and
   facilitate the transformation from destructive demolition to optimal
   deconstruction. One case study demonstrates that the accuracy of the
   structural information less than 1.94 mm can be controlled within the
   effective deviation range by combining the building information
   modelling (BIM) and the digital technology. Through optimization on the
   building joints and deconstruction process, the reusable potential after
   deconstruction increases by 5.37\%.},

Abstract = {The development housing consumes natural resources and fossil fuels.
   Thus not only depleting the resources but also damaging the environment
   by generating embodied carbon footprint, extent of which is governed by
   various factors including physical characteristics of built facility.
   The current study investigates the relationship between these physical
   factors and embodied CO2 for conventional housing construction in
   tropical climate. Five selected single units with different areas of
   construction have been evaluated. The units were redeveloped in virtual
   environment by Building Information Modeling (BIM). Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) methodology was adopted to quantify the embodied CO2
   content. The variables of area, weight of materials and carbon
   footprint, observed a significant positive interrelationship. A 2.5
   times increase in area resulted in 50\% increase in carbon footprint
   content which ranged from 19 kg-CO2/sft to 31 kg-CO2/sft. Bricks,
   concrete and steel metals were top three materials with an average share
   of more than 80\%.},

Title = {Quantification process of carbon emissions in the construction industry},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {289},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change has raised awareness on the need to achieve net-zero
   carbon emissions and improve the sustainability of buildings. To reduce
   the complexity of quantifying carbon emissions, there is a need for
   practical guidance on the quantification of lifecycle carbon emissions
   from buildings. Existing reviews appear to only focus on part of carbon
   emissions quantification and are therefore deemed unable to provide an
   overview of how to quantify the building's whole lifecycle carbon
   emissions. Hence, this study aims to review the quantification process
   of carbon emissions from cradle to cradle in the construction industry,
   which included trends in the materials studied, lifecycle stages
   studied, quantification methods, common data extraction practises,
   assumptions made and formulas used to quantify carbon emissions. A
   systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA methodology.
   This study identified 699 publications from Scopus and Web of Science,
   and 65 full-text articles were included in the review. It can be
   concluded that the current practises lack transparency, which prohibits
   the comparison of different case studies. Also, all the information
   required for the quantification of carbon emissions during different
   stages was specified in detail to guide the carbon quantification
   process. The review further found that the production stage was the most
   commonly studied stage in previous research. In cases of missing
   information, assumptions were made, which were found to be common in
   practise. The underlying assumptions must be explicitly and thoroughly
   specified in order to avoid simplification and prevent inaccurate
   quantification of carbon emissions, and ultimately ensure the
   effectiveness of low-carbon design strategies. The review also
   highlighted the challenges in quantifying carbon emissions and proposed
   that these challenges be addressed by identifying appropriate solutions
   through the integrated use of digital technologies, such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IOT), and
   blockchain technology. Adoption of these technologies can lead to better
   data collection and sharing, increased transparency, secure
   collaboration among stakeholders, and the potential establishment of
   standardised methodologies for accurate carbon emissions quantification,
   all of which can lead to improved energy efficiency management in the
   built environment. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) has the potential to advance and
   transform facilities Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) by providing a
   platform for facility managers to retrieve, analyze, and process
   building information in a digitalized 3D environment. Currently, because
   of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals
   need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in
   facility O\&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on
   the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O \&M
   research and application developments from a facility manager's point of
   view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising
   future research directions. The scope of this research includes the
   academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using
   BIM to improve selected facility O\&M activities, including maintenance
   and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation
   management, and security. The content analysis results show that
   research on BIM for O\&M is still in its early stage and most of the
   current research has focused on energy management. We have identified
   that the interoperability in the BIM-O\&M context is still a challenge
   and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to
   address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to
   understand the underlying O\&M principles for BIM implementation - data
   requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition,
   more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are
   required to justify the value of BIM-O\&M applications and an improved
   Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The building sector accounts for 38\% of carbon emissions, the principal
   cause of climate change. To meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement,
   including zero net emissions by 2050, it is necessary that governments
   develop a culture of sustainability. Whole Life Carbon Assessment of a
   building, comprehensive of operational and embodied carbon (EC), is
   described by EN15978:2011. Net Zero Carbon Buildings (NZCB) achieve a
   balance of zero emissions during their life cycle, promoting both
   reduction and compensation by adopting many strategies (e.g., reuse of
   existing structures, design for adaptability and disassembly, circular
   economy principles). Choosing bio-based materials is also helpful to
   compensate for EC, thanks to the biogenic carbon stored during their
   growth. The aim of this research is to find out which strategies are
   relevant to meet NZCB target, in order to apply them to a case study of
   reuse of an abandoned building in Milan, highlighting the design
   process. Material quantities were extracted from the BIM model and
   imported in OneClick LCA to assess embodied carbon emissions (A1-A5
   modules, material production and supply, transport, construction). The
   final design stage achieved a reduction of 91\% in EC compared to a
   standard new construction, while the bio-based materials compensated for
   the rest. Further research can improve the Environmental Product
   Declaration (EPD) of materials and assess the entire building life
   cycle.},

Abstract = {BIM is a concept and also a method currently applied throughout the
   world in the modern building construction. The impact and benefits of
   the BIM method are clear across all stages of the life cycle of
   buildings (project, realization, operation, demolition). The longest and
   most expensive phase of buildings life is the operation and usage part.
   Many common aspects and linkage of processes between the BIM method and
   the facility management, i.e. a modern asset management method, can
   provide greater efficiency for these activities, help reduce the cost of
   required building operations and maintenance and save time for
   individual activities. The BIM can be understood as an information
   management of buildings. Many common elements can create a synergy of
   processes related to the management of buildings. The article discusses
   these aspects and emphasizes the listing of the basic data and processes
   that are necessary for mutual interconnectedness.},

Title = {Advancing the Design of Resilient and Sustainable Buildings: An
   Integrated Life-Cycle Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {A holistic evaluation of a building's environmental impact must include
   a thorough accounting of both its operating and embodied energies,
   inclusive of the influence of hazard-induced damage and repairs.
   Unfortunately, these considerations are notoriously absent in today's
   practice owing to a traditionally segmented approach to the design
   process that has perpetuated interoperability challenges between
   existing commercial tools. In response to this and other limitations of
   existing approaches, this paper offers an integrated life-cycle
   assessment (iLCA) that (1) considers the effects of site-specific
   climate and exposure to wind and seismic hazards on a building's
   embodied and operating energy, (2) adopts an assembly-based approach to
   reveal the specific components influencing performance outcomes, (3)
   accommodates both risk-neutral and risk-adverse perspectives, and (4)
   addresses interoperability challenges that limit access to the data
   stored within commercial building information models. The resulting iLCA
   is partitioned into a sustainability workflow, with modules dedicated to
   embodied and operating energy, and a resilience workflow, sequencing
   modules for hazard characterization, structural response, damage, and
   repair/loss. A custom parser leverages semantic technologies to
   efficiently extract geometry and material information from the
   underlying data structures of Revit building information models; this
   parser ultimately supplies the required building data to each module. A
   unifying probabilistic framework is then adopted to quantify life-cycle
   performance, in terms of repair costs and total (embodied and operating)
   energy, with emphasis placed on expanding the statistical descriptions
   of performance to support both risk-neutral and risk-averse
   decision-making. The iLCA is applied to a case study office building at
   two sites to demonstrate the effects of climate and wind and seismic
   hazards on the performance of specific components over different service
   lives, inclusive of potential performance variability due to hazard
   exposure. The framework is further leveraged to examine how different
   sources of uncertainty, or assumptions surrounding the quantification of
   this uncertainty, impact life-cycle performance estimates. (C) 2020

Title = {OpenBIM driven marginal abatement cost of low-carbon measures in
   building design},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {377},
Number = {B},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Reducing carbon emissions always incurs additional costs in buildings,
   but it is difficult to productively evaluate and certify the
   cost-effectiveness of low-carbon measures. Therefore, this paper
   proposes an OpenBIM-based method for analyzing the marginal abatement
   cost (MAC) of these low-carbon measures. This method uses industry
   foundation classes (IFC) to calculate the life cycle carbon emission
   (LCCE) and life cycle cost (LCC), subsequently drawing the MAC curve for
   construction projects. Taking a public building in China as a case
   study, it indicates that eight measures show the synergy between LCCE
   and LCC, while four measures show the opposite. Therefore, this study
   suggests that building projects should not blindly raise the baseline
   but rather identify the cost-effective low-carbon measures through
   quantitative calculations. Moreover, this research addresses the
   interoperability problem of multi-source heterogeneous data when
   evaluating MAC stored and certified by the IFC, helping designers
   quickly identify cost-benefit reduction strategies.},

Title = {Towards a conceptual framework to manage BIM/COBie asset data using a
   standard project management methodology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-187},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate a systematic
   methodology to manage asset data flow between building stakeholders
   throughout building life cycle using the Construction Operation Building
   Information Exchange (COBie) standard.
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review of the relevant
   building information modelling (BIM) for facilities management (FM)
   studies including the gaps and challenges of producing COBie data is
   analysed. Then a standard project management methodology by Project
   Management Institute (PMI) is introduced as a theoretical framework to
   map the different areas of managing COBie data as a project in
   coordination with Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Plan of
   work. This theoretical background is coupled with an inductive approach
   through the placement within a construction company (Bouygues, UK) in
   the UCLH construction project to produce the conceptual framework that
   is aligned with industry needs.
   Findings - The lack of well-structured approach to manage COBie data
   throughout building life cycle causes many problems and confusions about
   the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in creating and
   managing asset data. This confusion in turn results in incomplete and
   low-quality COBie data at the handover phase which hinders the ability
   of facility managers to use these data effectively in the operations
   phase. The proposed conceptual framework provides a standard project
   management process to systemise the data flow among all stakeholders.
   Practical implications - The proposed framework is developed in liaison
   with a large construction company, so it is well aligned with an actual
   industry approach to managing COBie data. Furthermore, it provides a
   systematic step-by-step approach to managing COBie as a project that
   could be easily implemented in actual construction projects.
   Originality/value - The paper introduced a novel approach to manage
   COBie data using a standard project management methodology based on an
   actual live construction project perspective coupled with project
   management theory.},

Title = {Quantifying Australia's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for new
   homes},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {224},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Australia is going through a significant housing boom with approximately
   200,000 new homes built each year; and significantly more are required
   on an annual basis to accommodate the estimated population growth of
   almost 36 million by 2050. The effects of climate change are
   increasingly being felt and respon-sive action is required for
   mitigation and adaption, which must include the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emis-sion implications of this new residential stock. Mitigation
   strategies have been predominantly focused on decreasing the operational
   GHG emissions associated with buildings, leaving the other life cycle
   stages, such as construction, largely ignored. To achieve national
   targets, such as zero net emissions by 2050, it is imperative to address
   GHG emissions mitigation from a life cycle perspective. This study found
   that based on current building practices one new detached dwelling built
   today will be responsible for roughly 545 tCO(2)e by 2050. This
   translates to the need to plant over 8,000 trees to offset these
   emissions, a figure it is safe to say, most homeowners will not achieve.
   This study modelled life cycle GHG emissions of all new detached
   dwellings constructed in Australia for a single year (2019) estimating
   39 MtCO(2)e, which increases to 883 MtCO(2)e by 2030 and 3,654 MtCO(2)e
   by 2050. This is much higher than the current projections for
   Australia's total emissions by 2030 of 563 MtCO(2)e if a business as
   usual approach is fol-lowed, and the optimum target of 441 MtCO(2)e to
   meet emissions targets of 26\% less than 2005. The results of this study
   suggest that housing-related GHG emission are underestimated by 60\%,
   because of the absence of embodied GHG emissions being counted in
   emission projections. This emphasises that firstly, target and current
   GHG emission projections fail to consider emissions from a life cycle
   perspec-tive, and primarily report findings based on operational data,
   which as this study has shown can lead to a misrepresentation of almost
   96\% of total life cycle GHG emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms need to innovate
   in order to increase their business' competitiveness. Many companies
   around the world are considering the possibility of implementing
   building information modelling (BIM) in their projects without knowing
   its actual benefits for the business. The current literature recognizes
   certain barriers to BIM implementation; therefore, considering these
   barriers, this work proposes a holistic model that allows managers to
   explain how BIM can play an important role for the success of the AEC
   companies. The pillars of the model are a collaborative culture and
   training of employees in order to break down technological barriers.
   This way, BIM can help AEC companies to innovate. This proposal takes
   into consideration the three phases of the infrastructure life-cycle. In
   the design phase, the model considers 3D shape, scheduling (4D), costs
   (5D), and sustainability (6D). In the construction phase, the model
   focuses on supply chain and quality management. During the operation
   phase, the model is related to the virtual management of maintenance
   activities. Drivers of innovation should consider several facets:
   marketing, technology, organization, processes, and products. This model
   aims to enlighten the positive effects of a good strategic management
   using BIM on innovation activities in each of the phases of the
   infrastructure life-cycle.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings play an important role to meet Sustainable Development Goals,
   especially regarding the use of resources and greenhouse gas emissions.
   They are increasingly designed with energy-efficient solutions regarding
   their operations, while the related use of natural resources is still
   insufficiently considered. In this article, a methodology in Building
   Information Modeling is proposed to measure the resource and climate
   footprints of buildings' heating systems. The methodology is applied to
   a case study building in Germany. The studied heating systems include a
   gas condensing boiler, ground-source heat pump, ground-source heat pump
   with a photo-voltaic system and air-source heat pump backed up with a
   gas boiler. Next to the operational energy, the production and transport
   of the heating systems were also studied. Results show that heating
   system operations have the largest impact and that the variant of
   ground-source heat pump combined with photovoltaics (GSHP + PV) has the
   lowest impact. In comparison with the gas boiler (GB), savings of 75\%,
   47\%, 80\%, and 84\% are addressed to climate, material, energy, and
   land footprints, respectively, while the water footprint of GSHP + PV is
   73\% higher than that of GB.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a method for optimizing the design and construction
   process of heat source systems that enables designers to continuously
   obtain information on the performance and costs of various heat source
   system configurations. A case study on the heat source system of an
   existing building was conducted using a simulation model, and Pareto
   optimal solutions for energy and life-cycle costs were determined for
   each heat source system configuration. Subsequently, the optimized
   design and construction process resulting from the proposed method and
   the conventional optimization were compared in terms of the life-cycle
   cost and energy consumption reduction effects. The results of subject
   tests confirmed that integrating building information modeling and
   simulation using the proposed method improves both the working time and
   precision.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and facilities management
   (AEC/FM) industry. Recently, 3D BIM models are commonly used; however,
   there is still some debates going on upon the necessity of as-built BIM
   models linked with operations and maintenance (O\&M) information of
   building's components. Owners are always faced with the dilemma of the
   benefits of real-time data driven BIM application in their projects'
   lifecycle. In this paper, the timesaving benefits of BIM models linked
   with real-time operational information in facilities management (FM)
   practices during a building's life cycle are studied. Real-time data
   driven BIM model application in operations control and maintenance, the
   two main responsibilities of FM departments, is studied in this paper.
   Several scenarios, tested in a building owned by USC facilities
   management department, are designed to determine the timesaving benefits
   of BIM model utilization. These scenarios are divided into two major
   categories: operations control and maintenance. Data acquisition from
   CRAC units, Chillers, and AHUs for operations control and two
   maintenance scenarios of occupant dissatisfaction from office
   temperature and leakage in chilled water lines have been studied in this
   paper. The time needed to accomplish the explained scenarios has been
   measured using two available approaches (Traditional vs. real-time data
   driven BIM). Based on achieved results, possible timesaving benefits of
   6D-BIM model application are explored and presented.},

Abstract = {Architectural programming, although a key part of AECFM processes, has
   not been well integrated into Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   Having access to architectural programming information throughout the
   life-cycle of a building can add value to design evaluation, facility
   management, renovation and extension. There is not currently a
   comprehensive and standard data model to store architectural programming
   information. Our research is producing a universal format for an
   architectural program of requirements (UFPOR) that can connect the
   architectural programming information to the IFC BIM schema. The result
   is a data model for architectural programming that is inherently
   interoperable with BIM standard schema. A graphical user interface
   facilitates data creation and manipulation. The schema and effectiveness
   of the bridging fields has been tested by entering the content of three
   two different architectural programming documents into the UFPOR
   database.},

Title = {Application Study on Building Information Model (BIM) Standardization of
   Chinese Engineering Breakdown Structure (EBS) Coding in Life Cycle

Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The successful adoption of building information modelling (BIM)
   technology has led to an ever-increasing need for improving management
   practices in both construction and operation stages of highway project
   engineering. The most significant aspect of applying BIM technology is
   establishing the rationality and concise engineering breakdown structure
   (EBS) coding. However, China has no uniform EBS coding standard for
   highways, which limits BIM technology development in different
   construction projects and at different stages of the same construction
   project. The purpose of this study is to propose an EBS standard that
   embodies a coding system for highways and at the same time meets the
   requirements of BIM management, project management (PM), and operation
   management (OM) in life cycle management process. This paper presents an
   EBS standard based on three classifications: (1) project-level
   construction, (2) project-level operation, and (3) network-level
   operation. A case study is given to illustrate the proposed EBS
   standard's coding system. The new EBS system will have better
   adaptability in both the design and construction stages. The proposed
   EBS coding system has been applied in many projects and is undergoing
   both improvement and standardization in China. The presented EBS coding
   standard provides successful implementation references for the future
   adoption and use of BIM on PM and OM in highway projects.},

Title = {Mapping the scientific research of the life cycle assessment in the
   construction industry: A scientometric analysis},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {204},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The interest toward the life cycle assessment studies in the
   construction industry has been increasing in the last decades. However,
   there is no existing study that focuses on mapping the scientific
   research of the LCAs in the construction industry with a comprehensive
   understanding. Hence, an expansive and macro level study of the LCAs
   within the subject domain is necessary to fulfill this gap in the
   literature. The research objective of this study is to reveal the status
   quo, hot topics and keywords, and emerging areas of the LCA research in
   the construction industry. For this purpose, systematic bibliometric and
   scientometric analyses were conducted by referring 2885 bibliometric
   records published between 1997 and 2021 (end of February). The analyses
   indicated China, USA, and Spain as the most productive countries in the
   field. Additionally, hot keywords in the domain revealed as `energy',
   `environmental impact', `sustainability', `performance', `emission',
   `building', `system', `design', and `concrete'. `Circular economy',
   `mechanical property', and `footprint' are found as the emerging areas
   of this field. Document co-citation clusters showed the hot research
   themes of the domain as building information modeling (BIM), energy
   performance, construction and demolition waste, carbonation, water
   supply, bridge design, optimization, pavement management, ventilation,
   and design assessment. The results of this research make a significant
   contribution to the scientific community and industry practitioners by
   providing an inclusive understanding of the recent status, hot keywords
   and topics, and emerging areas of the life cycle assessment in the
   construction industry. Further, this study would be a useful and
   valuable reference and guideline for the researchers interested in this
   field.},

   cycle assessment of buildings has been so far excluded in BIM, due to
   the high variety of accurate information and time required. In this
   paper, a systematic framework is presented and applied to a case study.
   BIM-LCA assists actors along the planning and designing phase, from the
   building conception as a whole, up to the elements' details and
   materials' definition. BIM and LCA intertwine in an application scheme
   of seven phases for integral planning and four levels of structural
   composition of a building. With respect to these, involved actors
   examine potential solutions through a tool which exploits alternative
   specifications in order to assess the environmental impacts. The goal of
   this paper is to demonstrate the application of a BIM-LCA model
   regarding decision making for reliable values of environmental impact in
   a given structural level of the building. The main findings of this
   framework are due to the multitude of actors and information
   orchestrated, namely to uncertainties which characterize the whole
   planning process and data handling. Through BIM-LCA, actors are assisted
   by ensuring flexibility of models and consistency of results throughout
   planning and designing.},

Abstract = {The growing pressure to optimise construction investment costs from the
   life-cycle perspective inevitably leads to efforts to seek new solutions
   that will facilitate informed decision-making in the early stages of the
   construction project. Awareness of the importance of considering future
   operation and demolition costs emphasises the shortcomings related to
   the possibility of making accurate predictions/estimations of such
   costs, which will become apparent in the future. To address this
   research gap, an innovative approach of life-cycle cost modelling on the
   level of individual structures of the building is presented. The model
   provides users with information on the costs of available technical
   solutions resulting from the requirements of the investor at a specific
   stage of the construction project. In this way, it helps investors
   optimise their building projects and to find the most economical
   solutions. Specifically, this model is assembled for the purpose of
   selecting a suitable partition wall and, therefore, it takes into
   consideration specific characteristics relating to this particular type
   of structure. The results indicate diversity in partition wall
   structural design variants at the early stage of the project. Since the
   ability to influence future costs decreases as the project progresses,
   the model allows capturing LCC perspective even if only a construction
   study is available without more detailed technical and economic
   information. The presented model aims to contribute to the higher
   performance of construction projects in the planning phase from the
   perspective of LCC and investors'/owners' point of view.},

Abstract = {The buildings natural ageing along with the absence of planned
   maintenance actions and the effects of climate changes accelerate the
   building materials degradation. So, to extend the materials' service
   life, the application of appropriate maintenance actions is imperative.
   This work aims to assess the building performance and to prioritize the
   maintenance actions employing Key Performance Indicators using Building
   Information Modelling(BIM) as a supporting tool for Building Condition
   Assessment-(BCA) and maintenance management. To achieve these goals a
   methodology was proposed and applied to a case study involving 1)
   Building data collection; 2) Building Life Cycle Cost estimation, and 3)
   Automated calculation of Building Performance Indicator. This research
   application highlights the importance of BIM role in buildings' Facility
   Management, allowing the model's permanent update of information, in
   this case for BCA purposes. It also has high potential to prioritize the
   building maintenance actions, extending its materials service life,

Abstract = {Substantial impacts through BIM implementation may be achieved
   throughout all stages of the construction process. The paper measures
   BIM use throughout the project lifecycle, confirming BIM is most often
   used in the early stages with progressively less use in the latter
   stages. This research demonstrates via 92 responses from a sample of BIM
   users that collaboration aspects produce the highest positive impact.
   The process aspects are more important than the software technology. BIM
   necessitates investment in software and training however, smaller
   practices can afford it. Stakeholder financial benefits are ranked
   concluding that clients benefit most financially from BIM followed by
   Facilities Managers. Despite this, over 70\% do not provide a 3D model
   and Cobie dataset at the conclusion of a project. Identification of Key
   Performance Indicators currently being used for BIM is provided and

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the evolution of building information
   modeling (BIM) is increasingly affecting the roles of construction
   management professionals in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry. Since the transition from 2D drafting to
   BIM is more of a process transformation, the use of BIM also affects how
   information is managed by and for construction management professionals.
   Teaching BIM in construction engineering and management (CEM) curriculum
   requires more emphasis on learning BIM as a process improvement
   methodology rather than only a technology. This paper describes the
   implementation of a graduate level course called ``Building Information
   Modeling for Capital Projects{''} that was developed to educate
   next-generation construction managers to understand BIM and effectively
   use an existing BIM in plan execution for building construction
   projects. This is a project-based course where students gain knowledge
   on the implementation of BIM concepts throughout the life cycle of a
   building. A process-oriented teaching approach was applied in the course
   and is introduced in the paper. Findings and lessons learned to date
   from the teaching experience are documented. (C) 2014 American Society

   Indiana, USA Using Process Modeling},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) has long been utilized for decision making
   about the sustainability of products. LCA provides information about the
   total emissions generated for a given functional unit of a product,
   which is utilized by industries or consumers for comparing two products
   with regards to environmental performance. However, many existing LCAs
   utilize data that is representative of an average system with regards to
   life cycle stage, thus providing an aggregate picture. It has been shown
   that regional variation may lead to large variation in the environmental
   impacts of a product, specifically dealing with energy consumption,
   related emissions and resource consumptions. Hence, improving the
   reliability of LCA results for decision making with regards to
   environmental performance needs regional models to be incorporated for
   building a life cycle inventory that is representative of the origin of
   products from a certain region. In this work, we present the integration
   of regionalized data from process systems models and other sources to
   build regional LCA models and quantify the spatial variations per unit
   of biodiesel produced in the state of Indiana for environmental impact.
   In order to include regional variation, we have incorporated information
   about plant capacity for producing biodiesel from North and Central
   Indiana. The LCA model built is a cradle-to-gate. Once the
   region-specific models are built, the data were utilized in SimaPro to
   integrate with upstream processes to perform a life cycle impact
   assessment (LCIA). We report the results per liter of biodiesel from
   northern and central Indiana facilities in this work. The impact
   categories studied were global warming potential (kg CO2 eq) and
   freshwater eutrophication (kg P eq). While there were a lot of
   variations at individual county level, both regions had a similar global
   warming potential impact and the northern region had relatively lower
   eutrophication impacts.},

Title = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) Driven Carbon Emission Reduction
   Research: A 14-Year Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Governments across the world are taking actions to address the high
   carbon emissions associated with the construction industry, and to
   achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement towards carbon
   neutrality. Although the ideal of the carbon-emission reduction in
   building projects is well acknowledged and generally accepted, it is
   proving more difficult to implement. The application of building
   information modeling (BIM) brings about new possibilities for reductions
   in carbon emissions within the context of sustainable buildings. At
   present, the studies on BIM associated with carbon emissions have
   concentrated on the design stage, with the topics focusing on resource
   efficiency (namely, building energy and carbon-emission calculators).
   However, the effect of BIM in reducing carbon emissions across the
   lifecycle phases of buildings is not well researched. Therefore, this
   paper aims to examine the relationship between BIM, carbon emissions,
   and sustainable buildings by reviewing and assessing the current state
   of the research hotspots, trends, and gaps in the field of BIM and
   carbon emissions, providing a reference for understanding the current
   body of knowledge, and helping to stimulate future research. This paper
   adopts the macroquantitative and microqualitative research methods of
   bibliometric analysis. The results show that, in green-building
   construction, building lifecycle assessments, sustainable materials, the
   building energy efficiency and design, and environmental-protection
   strategies are the five most popular research directions of BIM in the
   field of carbon emissions in sustainable buildings. Interestingly, China
   has shown a good practice of using BIM for carbon-emission reduction.
   Furthermore, the findings suggest that the current research in the field
   is focused on the design and construction stages, which indicates that
   the operational and demolition stages have greater potential for future
   research. The results also indicate the need for policy and
   technological drivers for the rapid development of BIM-driven
   carbon-emission reduction.},

   climate and energy saving/carbon reduction. Currently all countries
   realise that buildings are large consumers of energy during their life
   cycle. The United Nations initiated `Global Green Policy'as well as
   `Sustainable architecture and building initiative' that are related to
   the use of resources in buildings. These policies strive for goals
   `zero-resource buildings' and `building resource regulating'. Because of
   this, many countries have developed various building resource codes in
   dealing with building resource demand, thus gradually using
   energy-saving materials and equipment and alternative renewable green
   resources to coordinate with industry development. This includes actions
   such as mandatory design standards, green procurement policies and
   incentive subsidies and tax break policies. This research is directed
   towards existing buildings in the Kaohsiung area (over 90\%). It uses
   planning design analysis of existing building outer shell energy-saving
   design transformation. By using data collection and choosing townhouses
   in Kaohsiung city (representative case), we use a building energy
   simulation in a building information model (BIM) to carry out efficiency
   analysis and simulation of exterior energy-saving transformation. By
   using simulation estimates for verification, the results integrate a
   building environmental efficiency model (EEM) and evaluate its life
   cycle cost and efficiency (LCCE). Research results can act as a
   reference for sustainable building design transformation principles.},

Abstract = {The importance of technical disclosure in construction of project is
   described and the necessity of application of BIM (Building Information
   Modeling) technology used in technical disclosure is analyzed
   correspondingly. Many actual cases of technical disclosure in
   construction used BIM technology in our company with its application are
   discussed subsequently. The results show that the BIM technology can
   simplify the procedures of technical disclosure on the construction
   phase, and multi-software work together based on BIM provides a guidance
   for different types of projects. Many advantages of BIM such as
   construction simulation, 3D roaming can improve the quality of technical
   disclosure. Finally, recommendations and requirements for the specific
   implementation of BIM on the construction phase are proposed: the BIM
   model for technical disclosure is the most unique model in the entire
   life cycle; the locally refined extent is much more than the final
   completion model, which should be paid more attention to in the whole
   process of program development when BIM implemented.},

Abstract = {The market of Adaptive Building Skins has been growing at a slow but
   incremental speed, as these technologies ensure better indoor climatic
   comfort and more efficient energy management than traditional solutions.
   Nonetheless, if we acknowledge the building as a system of physical
   qualities oriented to overall environmental performance, the resource
   optimization has to be extended to considering a wider range of
   environmental impacts along the entire building life cycle. For this
   purpose, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method is recognized by
   stakeholders as the most world-renowned standardized tool for weighting
   environmental impacts. The aim of this study is to scrutinize the state
   of the art of LCA among stakeholders enrolled in the design and
   manufacturing of building and adaptive facades in the Italian market.
   Data have been collected throughout interviews and an online survey
   focusing on investigating the knowledge and experience level of
   participants. Results not only draw the attention to develop new market
   models by implementing sustainable building protocols concerning
   adaptive technologies, but also provided a positive assessment on the
   usability degree of a parametric design mapping based on a systemic and
   life-cycle-oriented approach to achieve environmental scopes and
   introduce competitive factors and boost innovation in the Italian
   building industry.},

Abstract = {European Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry
   consumes a significant amount of materials like steel, aluminum, copper
   and plastics, thus creating a large reservoir on secondary raw materials
   in buildings. One of the main strategies to minimize environmental
   impacts and the energy consumption is maximizing recycling rates. To
   enable circularity, and in consequence high recycling rates, material
   information about the existing building stock is necessary. Therefore,
   new design-centric tools and methods, as well as tools, which enable a
   compilation of data repositories on the material composition of
   buildings, are required. The first aim of this research is the
   generation of a Building Information Modelling (BIM) - supported
   Material Passport (MP), which enables an assessment of the recycling
   potential and environmental impacts of building materials. For the
   compilation of the semi-automated MP, a specific methodology was
   developed and tested on a use case. Thereby various challenges regarding
   data and stakeholders were faced, such as inconsistent data and lack of
   collaboration between various stakeholders. These challenges lead to the
   second focus of this paper - the development of a data- and stakeholder
   management framework. The data- and stakeholder management framework
   presents the required collaboration of various stakeholders in order to
   achieve a successful implementation of the MP in the AEC industry.
   Results show, that a semi-automated compilation of the BIM-based MP is
   possible and the implementation of the MP in the AEC industry requires
   close collaboration of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, thus forming a
   need for creating digital platforms for life cycle management of
   buildings and material resources.},

Abstract = {The complexity of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method requires many
   subjective choices throughout the procedure, which make decision making
   difficult and LCA results insecure. Our approach consists in combining
   life cycle thinking and sensitivity analysis to provide information to
   the actor of a foreground system within a product's life cycle. For any
   parameter of a foreground system, the trends and quantified influence on
   impact categories are systematically compared to determine the most
   effective action levers for actors controlling the process. This
   approach has been previously applied to a single actor, the farmer, in a
   case study of hemp crop production. In this study, we introduce a second
   life cycle actor: the industrial producer for transformation of hemp
   straw into insulation products for buildings. The relationships between
   farming and industrial actors are examined and demonstrate that
   industrial actors have action levers limited to climate change and
   energy consumption. Only a joint action of both actors can allow further
   reduction of climate change and energy consumption impacts.
   Nevertheless, the farmer action alone can allow reduction of other
   environmental impacts such as human toxicity or ecotoxicity. (C) 2016

Title = {Multi-objective optimization for LEED-new construction using BIM and
   genetic algorithms},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although LEED excels in reducing the negative environmental impacts and
   the energy consumption of buildings, the high costs in the early phases
   of the implementation and pursuit of LEED certification are pushing away
   some project owners from entering the process. How can the objectives of
   (1) getting the points necessary to achieve the desired LEED
   certification and (2) the life-cycle cost of sustainable projects be
   balanced? In this study, Non -dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II
   (NSGA-II), a multi-objective optimization tool, is proposed to find the
   optimal solution measured in terms of life-cycle cost and sustainability
   for a new construction project pursuing LEED v4 BD + C New Construction
   and Major Renovation certification. A BIM project of a 3-floor
   educational building was selected as a case study to verify the
   efficiency and soundness of the proposed model. The results show that
   the method does indeed lead to optimal solutions. The proposed model is
   expected to benefit con-struction owners, designers, and contractors
   alike, Expanding the database of components and extending the model to
   cover LEED v4 projects other than BD + C New Construction and Major
   Renovation could improve the reach and impact of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {The application of white box models in digital twins is often hindered
   by missing knowledge, uncertain information and computational
   difficulties. Our aim was to overview the difficulties and challenges
   regarding the modelling aspects of digital twin applications and to
   explore the fields where surrogate models can be utilised
   advantageously. In this sense, the paper discusses what types of
   surrogate models are suitable for different practical problems as well
   as introduces the appropriate techniques for building and using these
   models. A number of examples of digital twin applications from both
   continuous processes and discrete manufacturing are presented to
   underline the potentials of utilising surrogate models. The surrogate
   models and model-building methods are categorised according to the area
   of applications. The importance of keeping these models up to date
   through their whole model life cycle is also highlighted. An industrial
   case study is also presented to demonstrate the applicability of the
   concept.},

Abstract = {The AEC industry is increasingly requiring more integration in the
   different phases of the building life-cycle. The progressive adoption of
   BIM technology is contributing to this integration by facilitating the
   participation of the multiple actors involved. However, only those who
   have access to the BIM model can participate in this process leaving out
   other stakeholders such as manufacturers of building components and
   systems. To over-come these limitations, it is necessary to link BIM
   models with other information systems. In this way, BIM models would be
   part of a comprehensive ecosystem in which they can relate to other AEC
   databases. We have developed an architecture of an information system
   which facilitates the connection between building component catalogues,
   associated services, and BIM software. Semantic Web technologies have
   been used to integrate multiple data sources providing a unified access
   which facilitates end-users searching in a building product catalogue.
   In this paper, we present the work done and discuss the consequences of
   the application of ontologies to integrate building product catalogues
   and BIM models.},

Abstract = {The overall adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has
   increased considerably in recent years; however, utilization of BIMs
   post-construction is still seldom explored or documented. Much of this
   may be due to the fact that there still remains great inconsistency
   between stakeholders' levels of BIM proficiency. In order to achieve a
   life-cycle use of BIMs, it is critical that the Architecture,
   Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry determine if
   it is moving closer to achieving a mature BIM standard or if
   organizationally it is still just grazing the surface of what BIM can
   do. Based on a survey of a diverse sample of the construction industry,
   this study evaluates the quality and maturity of BIM implementation
   across various organizations as well as the quality of BIM execution on
   current construction projects.},

Title = {Building cooling energy uncertainty and life cycle economic performance:
   A stochastic air conditioning behavior model based comparative analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {266},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the energy and economic uncertainty of
   residential apartments using a stochastic AC behavior model and
   evaluates the appropriateness of existing building standards/codes-based
   AC setting in predicting energy and life cycle economic performance of
   energy-saving measures (e.g. wall insulation) in hot summer and cold
   winter zone of China. Monte Carlo simulation, distribution fitting and
   statistical tests were used to conduct relevant analysis. Results show
   that cooling energy uncertainty at different temporal scales is
   significant ranging from 8.59\% (annual) to 70.22\% (hourly) while
   standards/codes-based AC setting does not provide uncertainty
   information. The widely used simple assumption that the relative values
   of the energy-saving effects in actual are the same as those in thermal
   simulation (standard-based AC setting) is incorrect and there is a
   significant overestimation of cooling energy saving by standard-based AC
   setting. Further life cycle economic analysis of adding wall insulation
   shows that standards/codes-based AC setting may overestimate net present
   value (NPV) by about 1243.82\% and lead to an inappropriate design
   decision when comparing different energy-saving measures. Therefore,
   existing building standards/codes-based AC setting may lead to biased
   energy and economic prediction of energy-saving measures and
   recommendations on future building standard and policy improvements are
   provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reducing construction waste in the construction life cycle of industrial
   projects during design phase by using system dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {There is tremendous growth in the construction of industrial projects in
   Egypt, resulting in a substantial quantity of construction waste during
   the industrial projects construction life cycle (CLC). This research
   assumes that managing the factors of construction waste will inevitably
   reduce its quantity during the CLC using building information modeling
   (BIM) and lean design. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impacts
   of two techniques (Designing Out Waste and Design Strategies) based on
   qualitative factors using the BIM/Lean design concepts in the design
   phase which could reduce construction waste in the CLC of industrial
   projects. To achieve this aim, the research presents a comprehensive
   analysis of the factors of construction waste using system dynamics. A
   model was proposed that serves as a decision-support tool to ensure
   construction waste reduction in the CLC. The model in this study
   includes eight causal loop diagrams giving the professionals better
   understanding for the objectives to reduce construction waste. This
   model has been processed using AnyLogic software with a stock-flow
   diagram to create the system dynamics model. Finally, the validation and
   implementation are demonstrated using a case study for the suggested
   model. The case study's findings improved the model's confidence in
   order to utilize it for quantitative analysis. It has been further
   assessed for its impact in two proposed scenarios to reduce construction
   waste. The system dynamic model in this study contributes to better
   practices and proper decisions in the construction field.},

Title = {Development of a Plug-In to Support Sustainability Assessment in the
   Decision-Making of a Building Envelope Refurbishment},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Existing studies provide evidence that buildings and the construction
   sector are the largest consumers of natural resources and carry the
   greatest responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. In order to
   reverse this situation, future challenges involve utilising the lowest
   amount of resources possible. To this end, building refurbishment has
   become a crucial strategy, given its potential to improve operational
   energy efficiency and to extend the life span of existing building
   stock, thereby reducing the environmental impact while also providing
   social and economic benefits to our cities. Life cycle sustainability
   assessment (LCSA) has become one of the scientific community's most
   widely recognised methodologies for the evaluation of the social,
   economic, and environmental dimensions (triple bottom line), as it
   assesses sustainability using quantitative metrics. However, the
   implementation of this methodology to support the refurbishment process
   at the project stage in building design tools, such as BIM, remains
   scarce. One of the main obstacles lies in the difficulties of accessing
   building information, given that the system boundaries only cover new
   materials and products. Hence, this study proposes a BIM plug-in
   developed to support multi-dimensional building material selection in
   the early design steps based on the LCSA of a building during the
   refurbishment stage and validates its application in a case study. The
   results show the viability of using this tool during the early design
   stages and demonstrate the consistency of the results for evaluating
   various material and product alternatives for the refurbishment of the
   envelope system of a multi-family residential building. This study
   contributes towards the integration of decision-making by providing
   real-time assessment of a building envelope.},

Abstract = {While many scholars have discussed what a company should look like when
   it has reached an advanced state in using its information, there has
   been little empirical research to develop a valid effectiveness measure
   to determine whether a company is doing a good job of managing its
   information. Based on a theoretically derived model of an information
   life cycle, this study empirically tests a measure of information
   management practices (IMP) that can be part of future business
   measurement approaches. To ensure that we maintain an enterprise-wide
   perspective, we focus on senior managers' perceptions of how well their
   companies manage information. We discuss IMP as a `process' or life
   cycle that involves sensing, collecting, organising, processing and
   maintaining information to enhance its use for decision-making. We first
   give an overview of the research on life cycle views of information
   management. Next, we present our information management life cycle
   framework and its dimensions. We then statistically determine the extent
   to which these ideas exist in the minds of senior managers as reflected
   in the second-order construct IMP. Finally, we discuss the implications
   for evaluating and measuring IMP in companies. The contributions have
   scholarly value as a building block in a theory of knowledge management,
   and practical value as a validated measure of the effectiveness of IMP.},

Abstract = {In order to overcome the low accuracy of high-rise residential

   the BIM building model; then uses BIM related application software to
   build a three-dimensional building information model; and then
   calculates the energy consumption of the construction life cycle,
   including the preparation stage, the construction maintenance stage, the
   operation stage and the demolition disposal stage. Finally, the
   monitoring performance is compared and analysed through an example. The
   experimental results show that compared with the traditional high-rise
   residential construction energy consumption monitoring method, the error
   between the monitoring results of high-rise residential construction
   energy consumption and the actual energy consumption value is less,
   377.94 (kW . h), which proves that the monitoring results based on BIM

Title = {Waste capacity and its environmental impact of a residential district
   during its life cycle},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {286-296},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings generate a significant amount of waste that has considerable
   impacts on environment and energy flow. This study aims to investigate
   the waste capacity of the selected district and its effect on the
   environment within the current waste management policy via Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) methodology based on the two indicators; global warming
   potential and energy flow. The district has 82 buildings with 64,971m2
   total gross area and 2,000 populations. Accordingly, the district's
   waste capacity was evaluated within the classification of Municipal
   Solid Wastes (MSW), liquid wastes, and demolition wastes.
   The system boundaries of the LCA were set based on the gate-to-grave
   approach, which includes generated wastes during the lifespan of the
   buildings, including their end-of-life stage. Consequently, energy
   recovery potentials from waste processes were investigated and compared
   with the primary energy demand of the operational energy consumption of
   the buildings to perceive the amount of energy compensation range.
   Additionally, buildings' physical conditions, which obtained from their
   Building Information Models (BIM), energy performances, derived from
   their energy models and local specifications, obtained from standards
   were utilized to identify the current conditions and waste management
   systems. Critically, the outcomes of all those were used as input data
   for the LCA model.
   The results showed that there had been energy recovery potentials from
   MSW's treatments, while liquid wastes and demolishing wastes treatments
   have consumed energy. Energy recovery potential from MSW has compensated
   only 5.8\% of operational energy annually, which came from recycling
   processes. Also, all waste management systems release greenhouse gases
   to the atmosphere that cause global warming. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Title = {Three-Dimensional Location-Based O\&M Data Management System for Large
   Commercial Office Buildings},

Abstract = {Owing to long building life cycles, facility management (FM) entails a
   significant responsibility. Furthermore, it is difficult to effectively
   manage the numerous operation and maintenance (O\&M) data generated
   during the building life cycle, especially for large commercial office
   buildings. Without this, the facility managers in the operational role
   cannot achieve a high performance of buildings. However, relatively
   little research has been conducted on systematic O\&M data management
   processes or methodologies. As a fundamental approach to O\&M data
   management, considerable attention has been given to the analysis on
   their patterns and trends, specifically based on locational space. The
   building information modeling (BIM) is a relevant solution for O\&M data
   management that can easily handle data based on locational space. The
   objective of this study is to develop a practical O\&M data management
   system that employs location-based data analysis. This study has
   established a data-processing methodology and developed a computerized
   system using BIM technology. The system allows more accurate cost
   management and customized O\&M work planning and execution, supporting
   timely decisions for building renovation. As a pioneering work, this
   study contributes to O\&M data management research by establishing an
   O\&M data hierarchy for location-based analysis and by presenting the
   system's algorithm and framework. Additionally, the result of this
   research-a location-based O\&M data management system (i. e.,
   LOMDS)-facilitates more accurate and effective O\&M data analysis,
   thereby helping optimize O\&M decision making for large commercial
   office buildings. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {BIM-based life cycle environmental performance assessment of
   single-family houses: Renovation and reconstruction strategies for aging
   building stock in British Columbia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The building sector accounts for 40\% of the energy use and one-third of
   the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Buildings deteriorate with
   age, which leads to a decrease in their energy performance. Therefore,
   it is significant to improve the energy performance of aging building
   block although it is challenging. The two main decision paths for
   municipalities are renovation and reconstruction. This study
   investigated the above options for the older housing stock in a densely
   populated urban centre in British Columbia, Canada. A scenario-based
   analysis approach was taken to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions of
   six different renovation and reconstruction scenarios. The total life
   cycle emissions were calculated for each scenario including the embodied
   and operational emission, and the emissions from building construction
   and maintenance. A BIM-LCA combined approach was used to assess the
   embodied GHG emissions with the SimaPro software. HOT2000 software was
   used to model the operational GHG emissions. The results show that in
   the reconstruction scenarios, around 40\% of the emissions are from the
   material manufacturing stage. The embodied emissions generated from the
   reconstruction scenarios are 5-6 times higher than the renovation
   scenarios. The life cycle GHG emissions of the existing house can be
   reduced by applying renovations, with the emissions saving gradually
   increasing with the level of retrofitting. The passive house
   reconstruction scenario delivers the greatest benefit in terms of life
   cycle emissions reduction compared to all other scenarios. In terms of
   the GHG emission intensity per unit area, the newly-built houses in
   scenarios 5 and 6 also have lower life cycle GHG emission per square
   meter than the renovated existing houses in scenario 1-4 after 15 and 10
   years to breakeven respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that
   when considering the older existing building stock, a careful weighing
   of options must take place before making the decision on replacing them
   with new construction. However, it is also important to consider the
   economic and social aspects before making decisions to renovate or
   replace existing houses. The study outcomes will support city planners
   and urban development planners to make decisions on BC aging building
   stock development, especially in high population density neighbourhoods.

Title = {Adopting BIM to Facilitate Dispute Management in the Construction
   Industry: A Conceptual Framework Development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Previous studies revealed that Building Information Modeling (BIM) has
   the potential to reduce project uncertainties, design errors, change
   orders, and delays, which might facilitate achieving effective dispute
   management in the construction industry. However, research into the
   adoption of BIM to holistically enhance effective dispute management is
   limited compared with the plentiful BIM research in the construction
   management field. This study explored whether and how BIM adoption can
   help minimize the chronic problem of dispute in the industry. A
   structured critical literature review method was employed in this study
   which involved 102 papers in the fields of BIM and construction
   disputes. Nine main common causes of disputes (e.g., change order,
   design error, site problem, contractual problem, payment problem, and
   delay) and eight primary benefits of BIM application (e.g., improved
   visual management, design optimization, improved information management,
   and enhanced collaboration) were identified. A conceptual framework was
   developed illustrating the mechanism of adopting BIM to facilitate
   dispute management in the overall life cycle of construction projects.
   The framework indicates that design error, delay, and change order can
   be reduced most significantly by most of the BIM benefits, whereas
   improved visual management, improved information management, and
   enhanced collaboration are three of the most frequently adopted BIM
   benefits that can settle the majority of dispute causes. This study
   contributes to dispute management with a more holistic view of adopting
   BIM in the life cycle of construction projects, as illustrated in the
   conceptual framework. In addition, the identified common causes of
   disputes and primary benefits of BIM application are valuable for on
   future research in these two areas.},

Title = {Use of GIS and BIM tools in determining the life cycle impact of urban
   systems. Case study: Residential buildings which apply the
   Eco-Efficiency Matrix in the city of Quito, Ecuador},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {383},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on
   changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction,
   which generates approximately 33\% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere
   and con-tributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present,
   interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of
   various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact.
   Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently
   linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75\% of carbon
   emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban
   concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically
   visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement
   routes were located according to the types of transport used and the
   location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as
   points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several
   tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level.
   The impact of the building in the production, construction,
   de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use
   of the three tools -LCA, BIM and GIS -allowed us to establish that the
   highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high
   consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in
   Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental
   impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore
   essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix,
   which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.},

   Industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND
   TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {76-83},
Abstract = {Apropos to numerous environmental issues highlighted globally and
   locally, Malaysia has now moving forward towards new agenda of greening
   the cities. A positive movement trend of new green building in the
   country can be seen as number of projects going into green rating
   application are increasing yearly. Nevertheless, sustainability impact
   is considered as significantly small since newly developed green
   building represent small percentage as compared to the existing
   non-green building. Therefore. the idea of greening the existing
   building through refurbislunent emerged in order to achieve wider
   sustainability objectives. Apart from that, supported with recent
   evolvement of technology and digitalization in construction industry, in
   lieu with governments' strategies to adopt Industry 4.0, Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) has also been acknowledged and used broadly
   as a solution to integrate and facilitate management of information
   throughout building lifecycles. Considering these two areas;
   sustainability and BIM are continuously gaining momentum these days,
   this paper attempts to explore BIM's potentials as an enabler to help
   greening the existing non-green building. Literature review is conducted
   focus on reviewing BIM and sustainability present status in Malaysian
   construction industry, also their relationship including examining
   potential areas where BIM may contribute to enhance the buildings'
   sustainability performances. Based on the reviews, there is a potential
   of bridging the two areas considering both has becoming a national
   construction industry agenda since the government released
   CITP2016-2020. To further concur the ideas, literature reviews has also
   proven that the ability of BIM to facilitate various functions has
   enable it to support several sustainability analyses such as energy,
   carbon emission, lighting, water, materials and waste, building and
   site, and costing analysis.},

Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With an ever-increasing volume and complexity of data collected from a
   variety of sources, the efficient management of geospatial information
   becomes a key topic in disaster risk management. For example, the
   representation of assets exposed to natural disasters is subjected to
   changes throughout the different phases of risk management reaching from
   pre-disaster mitigation to the response after an event and the long-term
   recovery of affected assets. Spatio-temporal changes need to be
   integrated into a sound conceptual and technological framework able to
   deal with data coming from different sources, at varying scales, and
   changing in space and time. Especially managing the information
   life-cycle, the integration of heterogeneous information and the
   distributed versioning and release of geospatial information are
   important topics that need to become essential parts of modern exposure
   modelling solutions. The main purpose of this study is to provide a
   conceptual and technological framework to tackle the requirements
   implied by disaster risk management for describing exposed assets in
   space and time. An information life-cycle management solution is
   proposed, based on a relational spatio-temporal database model coupled
   with Git and GeoGig repositories for distributed versioning. Two
   application scenarios focusing on the modelling of residential building
   stocks are presented to show the capabilities of the implemented
   solution. A prototype database model is shared on GitHub along with the
   necessary scenario data.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry has been
   utilizing Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for a long time to support
   energy efficiency improvements in the different phases of a building's
   life cycle. In this context, there has been a need for a proper means of
   exchanging and managing of different kinds of data (e.g., geospatial
   data, sensor data, 2D/3D models data, material data, schedules,
   regulatory, financial data) by different kinds of stakeholders and end
   users, i.e., planners, architects, engineers, property owners and
   managers. DSSs are used to support various processes inherent in the
   various building life cycle phases including planning, design,
   construction, operation and maintenance, retrofitting and demolishing.
   Such tools are in some cases based on established technologies such
   Building Information Models, Big Data analysis and other more advanced
   approaches, including Internet of Things applications and semantic web
   technologies. In this framework, semantic web technologies form the
   basis of a new technological paradigm, known as the knowledge graphs
   (KG), which is a powerful technique concerning the structured semantic
   representation of the elements of a building and their relationships,
   offering significant benefits for data exploitation in creating new
   knowledge. In this paper, a review of the main ontologies and
   applications that support the development of DSSs and decision making in
   the different phases of a building's life cycle is conducted. Our aim is
   to present a thorough analysis of the state of the art and advancements
   in the field, to explore key constituents and methodologies, to
   highlight critical aspects and characteristics, to elaborate on critical
   thinking and considerations, and to evaluate potential impact of KG
   applications towards the decision-making processes associated with the
   energy transition in the built environment.},

   reduction through the reuse and recycling of materials to achieve
   economic gains and save resources for future generations. This work aims
   to map the ac-ademic research on sustainable and circular construction
   from different imperative angles on the Web of Science (WoS) database.
   In this line, we classified and reviewed the existing research using a
   bibliometric and network analysis approach into the following themes:
   life cycle assessment (LCA), green assessment tools, technologies and
   methods, quantification of recycling of waste and energy, building
   information modeling (BIM), greenhouse gas emissions in construction,
   and greenhouse gas emissions in the specific case of novel construction
   types. The study provides a bird-eye-view of existing qualitative and
   quantitative research findings within the themes above. Subsequently,
   the study highlights the future research avenues within each theme to
   develop the domain further. The work will assist practitioners and
   policy-makers in understanding the current status of sustainable and

Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (
   AECFM) industry has been experiencing many changes since inexpensive
   networked, mobile computing devices have become ubiquitous. With the
   rising amount of information and data generated in the life cycle of
   capital projects, information modeling and data interoperability have
   become a critical element in design, engineering, construction, and
   maintenance of capital facilities. Recent advances in Visualization,
   Information Modeling, and Simulation ( VIMS) have the potential to
   address a number of these pressing challenges. The objective of this
   concept paper is to discuss challenges and ongoing research in three
   areas of study in VIMS: capturing experiential knowledge in building
   information modeling ( BIM)-based design coordination; 4-dimensional
   modeling for site-specific safety planning; and automating the BIM
   upkeep process in the facility operations phase leveraging deep learning
   and computer vision.},

Pages = {52339-52356},
Abstract = {As digital twins are gaining importance in various industries, research
   on their impact, use cases, and implementation in the field of
   construction is accelerating. In this study, we examine the impact of
   digital twins on building safety and security throughout their
   lifecycle, utilizing two state-of-the-art use cases for fire and anomaly
   detection. The solution employs advanced sensors, 3D visualizations for
   detecting safety and security threats, and data analysis to predict
   potential future threats. Using the data that was collected over a
   seventeen-month period, we present an implementation architecture for
   safety and security digital twins in buildings, explore the benefits and
   shortcomings of such a system, and discuss the learnings applicable to
   different lifecycle stages of a building. This paper contributes to the
   creation and study of a digital twin for fire safety, analyzing its
   performance using two real-world use cases and reporting the
   implementation results. Additionally, we extrapolate the learnings from
   the use phase of a facility to other lifecycle phases of buildings and
   facilities.},

Title = {BIM-Based End-of-Lifecycle Decision Making and Digital Deconstruction:
   Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article is the second part of a two-part study, which explored the
   extent to which Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used for
   End-of-Lifecycle (EoL) scenario selection to minimise the Construction
   and Demolition Waste (CDW). The conventional literature review presented
   here is based on the conceptual landscape that was obtained from the
   bibliometric and scientometric analysis in the first part of the study.
   Seven main academic research directions concerning the BIM-based EoL
   domain were found, including social and cultural factors, BIM-based
   Design for Deconstruction (DfD), BIM-based deconstruction, BIM-based EoL
   within LCA, BIM-aided waste management, Material and Component Banks
   (M/C Banks), off-site construction, interoperability and Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC). The analysis highlights research gaps in the
   path of raw materials to reusable materials, i.e., from the
   deconstruction to M/C banks to DfD-based designs and then again to
   deconstruction. BIM-based EoL is suffering from a lack of a global
   framework. The existing solutions are based on local waste management
   policies and case-specific sustainability criteria selection. Another
   drawback of these ad hoc but well-developed BIM-based EoL prototypes is
   their use of specific proprietary BIM tools to support their framework.
   This disconnection between BIM tools and EoL tools is reportedly
   hindering the BIM-based EoL, while no IFC classes support the EoL phase
   information exchange.},

Abstract = {In recent years, BIM (Building Information Modeling) because of its
   unified and efficient digitalization, visualization, synergistic and
   other engineering advantages is being widely concerned and researched
   and applied in various fields related to construction all over the
   world. In particular, it has played a huge coordination and optimization
   benefit for project cost management, construction resource deployment,
   and full life cycle control. As a typical resource-, technology- and
   manpower-intensive project, infrastructure engineering involves a large
   amount of complex and heterogeneous building information and real-time
   dynamic Internet of Things information. The traditional information
   control mode based on drawings often shows the disadvantages of
   information lag or even fragmentation. By analyzing the common
   information standard system of Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   specifically the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), this study
   establishes the correlation between the IFC standard system and its
   application in grid infrastructure projects. Subsequently, it conducts
   an assessment of the necessity and feasibility of extending IFC for grid
   engineering purposes. The current buildingSMART latest technical report
   emphasizes the general principles of IFC extensions, and the IFC grid
   engineering extensions are carried out on the basis of following this
   guideline. Finally, combined with ubiquitous power IoT technology, a set
   of BIM+IoT-based grid infrastructure whole process information
   management technology route program is initially proposed.},

Title = {A critical analysis of the integration of life cycle methods and
   quantitative methods for sustainability assessment},
Journal = {CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 29},
Abstract = {The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its corresponding
   methodologies gained considerable attention within the realm of
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability assessment.
   Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration
   along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques
   and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this
   literature review is to investigate the extent to which these
   methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives
   concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was
   restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout
   the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a
   broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including
   Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy
   Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods,
   economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of
   144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and
   quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were
   identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies
   relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical
   methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint
   application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability
   assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel
   approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information
   modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle
   methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing
   sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent
   outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the
   hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each
   method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be
   conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining
   these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures
   for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning
   sustainability assessment.},

Title = {Dynamic LCA of the increased use of wood in buildings and its
   consequences: Integration of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and material
   substitutions},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {226},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wood products can have a lower impact on climate change (CC) than other
   building materials, and their carbon content can transform buildings
   into temporary carbon sinks. However, the large-scale use of wood
   products in buildings requires a better understanding of their
   consequences to support CC policies. The consequential life cycle
   inventory of such products contains elementary flows with values
   sometimes greater sometimes less than zero. Therefore, their static
   assessment did not show the influence of carbon uptake and release,
   either during or after the temporal boundary of the system. The
   originality lies in the combination of the dynamic modeling of tree
   harvesting and growth, temporary carbon storage, end-of-life (EOL)
   strategies, material substitution, and characterization factors in a
   consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). This combination highlights
   the extent to which material substitution, EOL strategies, and carbon
   sequestration can be decisive. In addition, it addresses the static and
   dynamic measurements of radiative forcing (W.m(-2)) and the carbon
   dioxide (CO2) equivalent (CO(2)eq.). In this case study, material
   substitution contributed the most to result, followed by post-harvest
   CO2 sequestration. In terms of metrics, the conventional static LCA
   overestimates the long-term cumulative impact on CC (tonne CO(2)eq.)
   without providing information on the short-term impact of the case
   study. In addition, the assessment of such a dynamic consequential life
   cycle inventory (LCI) with a dynamic metric provides more specific
   information, regardless of the temporal boundary. However, the absolute
   dynamic metrics (W.m(-2)) should support the relative dynamic metric
   (tonne CO(2)eq. (1st year)) to avoid misleading conclusions.},

Title = {Assessing Life Cycle Environmental and Economic Impacts of Building
   Construction Solutions with BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Worldwide authorities are increasingly concerned about construction's
   efficiency and sustainability, leading to the development of
   high-performance buildings. However, such facts have shifted a
   significant percentage of the building life cycle environmental impacts
   from the operation to the product and construction phases. Thus, the
   need to evaluate and select more sustainable materials and construction
   solutions arises, to also minimize impacts from these stages. To
   evaluate those impacts, LCA and LCC analysis are usually applied to
   assess the building impacts and costs, through the different life cycle
   stages. Despite the usefulness of LCA and LCC methods during the project
   phase, they are usually evaluated in the project later stages. It is too
   complex and time-consuming to gather and process all the required data
   during the project early stages. With the recent deployment of BIM, the
   opportunity to automate and shift LCA and LCC analysis to project early
   stages stands out. Facing the research gap, this study aims to develop a
   BIM-based decision-making tool for designers to evaluate the
   environmental, economic, and functional performance of different
   building construction solutions. To do so, 18 different simulation
   scenarios have been created in Autodesk Revit with different
   combinations of external walls, roofs, and floors. Then, a framework was
   developed in Dynamo to automatically characterize the building elements
   life cycle environmental impacts and costs, as well as to automate the
   LCA and LCC analysis during the project early stages. The outcomes can
   significantly reduce the required time, errors and efforts when
   performing LCA and LCC analysis, providing designers with real time
   decision support data and making an important contribution to the use of
   BIM for sustainability purposes.},

Abstract = {The context life cycle demonstrates how context information moves around
   each phase into a system, from context modeling until context
   dissemination. The modeling phase turns context data gathered from
   sensors into a higher-level information, which in most cases is modeled
   through ontologies. Aiming at the building of a semantic context
   services infrastructure, this paper presents a systematic mapping of the
   state of art (2009-2015) about ontological context modeling-related
   services. The aim is to ground the development of those services,
   especially ontology-based context representation, storage and history,
   as part of a broad context management system. A systematic mapping
   protocol is described phase by phase and concludes with
   macro-architectural and general design principles, quality of design
   attributes, and open issues, all regarding the design of ontological

Abstract = {The benefits of BIM such as effective decision making, improved

   certification provide an optimised solution for sustainable design and

   tool (GBAT), which implements the proposed model and aids the design
   team in the generation of documentation necessary for obtaining green
   building certification. It extracts the necessary data from BIM models
   for calculating the green rating and provides feedback for further
   evaluation. A sample project is run and a green rating score table for
   the BREEAM materials category is obtained for validation of the model.
   This tool serves as a proof of concept that green data relevant for
   BREEAM certification can be automatically processed and used to inform
   the design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Benchmarks for environmental impact of housing in Europe: Definition of

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {260-275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study describes the results of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applied
   to 24 statistically-based dwelling archetypes, representative of the EU
   housing stock in 2010. The aim is to quantify the average environmental
   impacts related to housing in Europe and to define reference values
   (baseline scenario) for policies development. The average environmental
   impacts have been calculated taking into consideration the number of
   dwellings (clustered per typology, year of construction and climate
   zone) related to each representative model. System boundaries include
   production, construction, use (energy and water consumption),
   maintenance/replacement, and end-of-life phases of each dwelling. The
   environmental life cycle impact assessment was carried out using the
   ILCD method. EU average annual environmental impact per person, per
   dwelling, and per m(2) were calculated. Results show that the average
   life cycle greenhouse gases emissions related to housing per person per
   year are 2.62 t CO(2)eq and related to a representative dwelling per
   year are of 6.36 t CO(2)eq. The use phase (energy and water consumption)
   is the most relevant one, followed by the production and the
   maintenance/replacement phases. Single-family houses are responsible for
   the highest share of impacts related to housing in Europe. The same type
   of building has different impacts in different climatic zones, due to
   the differences in the need for space heating. In general, electricity
   use and space heating are the activities that contribute more to the
   overall impacts. The final results could be used as a baseline scenario
   for testing eco-innovation scenarios and setting targets toward impact
   reduction.},

Abstract = {The present article intends to contextualize the relevance of a linkage
   between BIM methodology and the COBie specification, identify the
   challenges and design guidelines for its implementation in structural
   rehabilitation projects. COBie specification encompasses several
   engineering projects of the constructive process, so generic files are
   listed for their integration into the stability engineering project and
   identified the type of information contained. Considerations that
   highlight the importance of the link between BIM methodology and the
   COBie specification are presented. However, cultural change that is
   needed within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation
   (AECO) sector are still a challenge.},

   be interested in the rise of the complexity extent of processes of the
   buildings in relation to corresponding cost of BIM. It shows that the
   establishment of BIM achieves the necessary extent of the efficiency,

Abstract = {Considering future seismic risk and life-cycle cost, the life-cycle
   seismic design of bridge is formulated as a preference-based
   multi-objective optimization and decision-making problem, in which the
   conflicting design criteria that minimize life-cycle cost and maximize
   seismic capacity are treated simultaneously. Specifically, the
   preference information based on theoretical analysis and engineering
   judgment is embedded in the optimization procedure. Based on reasonable
   displacement ductility, the cost preference and safety preference
   information are used to progressively construct value function,
   directing the evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm's
   search to more preferred solutions. The seismic design of a reinforced
   concrete pier is presented as an application example using the proposed
   procedure for the global Pareto front corresponding with engineering
   designers' preference. The results indicate that the proposed model is
   available to find the global Pareto front satisfying the corresponding
   preference and overcoming the difficulties of the traditional
   multi-objective optimization algorithm in obtaining a full approximation
   of the entire Pareto optimal front for large-dimensional problems as
   well as cognitive difficulty in selecting one preferred solution from
   all these solutions.},

Abstract = {With the digitalization of construction the planning and implementation
   process is undergoing a fundamental methodological transformation. The
   employment of BIM (Building Information Modelling) permits end-to-end
   planning. By means of sample projects it is explained how - above all in
   the service phases conceptual, preliminary and detailed design -
   intelligent parameterized building models can be set up in bridge and
   civil engineering. The additional combination with alignment and GIS
   data in these phases furnishes a flexible and robust basis upon which to
   create a holistic evaluation of planning concepts. With the application
   of a parameterized, object-oriented complete model it is possible to
   realize an integral process chain across the whole planning and
   implementation period as well as across the entire life cycle. The 3D
   model contains, apart from the individual structural components,
   project-specific attributes and information. Coupling the digital model
   to resource, cost and time scheduling and simulating the construction
   sequence yield complex 4D and 5D bridge models.},

Abstract = {Actors in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner and
   Operation (AECOO) industry traditionally exchange building models as
   files. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology advocates
   the seamless exchange of all information between related stakeholders
   using digital technologies. The ultimate evolution of the methodology,
   BIM Maturity Level 3, envisions interoperable, distributed, web-based,
   interdisciplinary information exchange among stakeholders across the
   life-cycle of buildings. TheWorldWideWeb Consortium Linked Building Data
   Community Group (W3C LBD-CG) hypothesises that the Linked Data models
   and best practices can be leveraged to achieve this vision in modern
   web-based applications. In this paper, we introduce the Building
   Topology Ontology (BOT) as a core vocabulary to this approach. It
   provides a high-level description of the topology of buildings including
   storeys and spaces, the building elements they contain, and their
   web-friendly 3D models. We describe how existing applications produce
   and consume datasets combining BOT with other ontologies that describe
   product catalogues, sensor observations, or Internet of Things (IoT)
   devices effectively implementing BIM Maturity Level 3. We evaluate our
   approach by exporting and querying three real-life large building
   models.},

   Building information modelling (BIM) facilitates energy analysis by
   reducing re-modelling efforts to create energy model. However, the lack
   of information makes energy prediction a challenging task in the early
   design phase with a deterministic approach. The research work analyses
   various information exchange scenarios at different levels of detail
   (LOD) that link to an approach of machine learning energy prediction
   model with BIM data. At any level of detail, information is
   distinguished by the labels ``available{''}, ``developing{''} and
   ``unknown{''}. Monte Carlo method will be used to generate samples of
   energy analysis for unknown information. The uncertainty of energy
   prediction is represented by mean, maximum and minimum values of heating
   load. The research will be useful for design space exploration at the
   early stage of design.},

Abstract = {As cities and economies grow, energy demands also grow, especially in
   developing countries, given the material production, construction, and
   operational processes of buildings and cities. Since the recent
   Powerhouse standard assumes that a building can generate as much energy
   as it will require during its lifespan, the present study aimed to
   implement this building standard in the Andean equatorial climate. For
   this purpose, a building energy model (BEM) integrated into a building
   information modeling (BIM) process design method was proposed,
   developing a prototype with vernacular technology, high solar potential,
   and local or regional data on embodied energy in accordance with a life
   cycle assessment (LCA) from cradle to grave. Solar potential estimations
   were complemented by system advisor model (SAM) tool projections.
   Because of the low energy content of the vernacular architecture
   proposal and prototype development with a high generation capacity, this
   standard can be met six times faster in the Andean equatorial climate
   than in extreme seasonal climates (8.53 years versus 60.0 years). The
   main goal of our research was to propose a methodological approach that
   integrates the BEM tool with vernacular concepts and materials and
   architectural formal criteria for high solar exploitation that, with
   background data from the literature, makes it possible to decipher the
   capability of the proposed energy standard.},

Abstract = {Creating a building information model (BIM) is known to be valuable
   during the life-cycle of a building. In most cases, a BIM of an existing
   building either does not exist or is out of date. For existing
   buildings, an as-is BIM is needed to leverage the technology towards
   building life-cycle objectives. To create an as-is BIM, field surveying
   is a necessary task in collecting current building related information.
   Terrestrial laser scanners have been widely accepted as field surveying
   instruments due to their high level of accuracy. However, laser scanning
   is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Site revisiting and
   reworking of the scanning process is generally unavoidable because of
   inappropriate data collection processes. In this context, creating a
   scan plan before going to a job-site can improve the data collection
   process. In this study, the authors have proposed a 2D proactive scan
   planning framework that includes three modules: an information-gathering
   module, a preparation module, and a searching module. In addition, three
   search algorithms a greedy best-first search algorithm, a greedy search
   algorithm with a backtracking process, and a simulated annealing
   algorithm were compared based on 64 actual building site drawings to
   identify strength and limitations. The experimental results demonstrate
   that the greedy search algorithm with a backtracking process could be
   used to compute an initial scan plan and the simulated annealing
   algorithm could be used to further refine the initial scan plan. This
   paper will also introduce the results of a case study that deployed the
   proposed scan-planning framework. In the case study, the resulting
   3D-point cloud that was generated based on the proposed framework was
   compared with the 3D point cloud created with data collected through a
   planned scanning process performed by a scan technician.},

Title = {Enabling an effective knowledge and information flow between the phases
   of building construction and facilities management},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {151-170},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate ways of transferring
   knowledge and information during the life-cycle phases of construction
   projects, particularly between the construction and occupancy phases,
   and to find an approach to minimise knowledge and information gaps
   during the handover process.
   Design/methodology/approach The study applied a qualitative approach
   involving a literature review and an archival analysis of information
   flow in the studied cases of a construction project, followed by a
   cross-cases analysis and expert interviews. Data on information flow
   were collected from three cases of building construction projects in
   Perth, Western Australia. In addition, a total of 18 local facilities
   management experts were interviewed to identify the key reasons of
   knowledge and information gaps and to propose an effective knowledge
   flow model.
   Findings The findings of this study indicated a significant knowledge
   and information gap, which exists during the handover process in
   construction projects in Western Australia. The findings of case
   analysis and expert interviews identified that the project handover
   guidelines were often ignored in construction projects in Western
   Australia, and the handover phase was not given the same priority as the
   design and construction phases by most of the project stakeholders,
   which led to information and knowledge gaps between the project
   construction and post-occupancy phases. The study conducted, integrated
   knowledge and information flow modelling to analyse the knowledge and
   information gaps followed by mapping the gaps against existing knowledge
   sharing frameworks (KSFs) before proposing an integrated knowledge
   sharing conceptual model to improve current practice and to enhance the
   information flow during the various phases of the construction project
   life cycle.
   Research limitations/implications The study is based on three cases in
   Perth, Western Australia, and thus the findings and recommendations are
   contextual. Whilst laying a good foundation to do so, further research
   is needed to investigate more cases in Western Australia and beyond to
   fully generalise the findings from this study.
   Originality/value The study contributes to improve the handover process
   and information flows in project life-cycle phases in Western Australia
   and develop an information flow model followed by bringing together
   existing KSFs, namely, the open communication channel (OCC), soft
   landing framework (SLF) and building information modelling (BIM), to
   propose an integrated knowledge sharing conceptual model. The
   methodology used here to analyse the information flow in a diagrammatic
   manner, the mapping of FM issues against the KSFs' capabilities and a
   conceptual model to facilitate change in the industry's silo mindset are
   the main contributions of this paper.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has implications for all processes
   and activities related to construction supply chain and can, thus, make
   significant contributions to lean construction process. The existing
   dimensions of BIM not only attend to most aspects of the construction

   further dimensions responding to other existing or future challenges.
   This paper will look into ways in which Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN)-COBie can help architects and engineers to perform HVAC analysis
   with the support of a BIM platform. Other applications e. g. HVAC load
   analysis and life-cycle cost analysis for any system or component
   associated with a building may be conducted using the ANN-COBie system
   that can be stored in the BIM authoring application and exported using
   IFC or gbXML to any analytic software. These applications' associated
   future challenges will be briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {The construction industry faces many challenges, including schedule and
   cost overruns, productivity constraints, and workforce shortages.
   Compared to other sectors, it lags in digitalization in every project
   phase. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have
   emerged as transformative technologies revolutionizing the construction
   sector. However, a discernible gap persists in systematically
   categorizing the applications of these technologies throughout the
   various phases of the construction project life cycle. In response to
   this gap, this research aims to present a thorough assessment of the
   deployment of AI and ML across diverse phases in construction projects,
   with the ultimate goal of furnishing valuable insights for the effective
   integration of these intelligent systems within the construction sector.
   A thorough literature review was performed to identify AI and ML
   applications in the building sector. After scrutinizing the literature,
   the applications of AI and ML were presented based on a construction
   project life cycle. A critical review of existing literature on AI and
   ML applications in the building industry showed that AI and ML
   applications are more frequent in the planning and construction stages.
   Moreover, the opportunities for AI and ML applications in other stages
   were discussed based on the life cycle categorization and presented in
   this study. The practical contribution of the study lies in providing
   valuable insights for the effective integration of intelligent systems
   within the construction sector. Academically, the research contributes
   by conducting a thorough literature review, categorizing AI and ML
   applications based on the construction project life cycle, and
   identifying opportunities for their deployment in different stages.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) may advantageously be used to
   support life-cycle management of engineering structures. The Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) are a standardized BIM data format issued by
   the International Organization for Standardization to describe
   engineering structures, such as buildings, tunnels, and bridges.
   Although often employed for describing basic features of structures, the
   IFC standard is not capable of sufficiently describing the planning
   procedure of wastewater treatment plants, which is determined by
   functional aspects. This paper presents an IFC schema extension that
   supports BIM-based planning of wastewater treatment plants. A semantic
   model, serving as a formal basis for the IFC schema extension, is
   defined that contains the semantics describing the information used for
   planning of wastewater treatment plants. The IFC schema extension
   proposed in this study enables BIM-based description of wastewater
   treatment plants in compliance with the IFC standard, and it may serve
   as basis for wastewater treatment plant simulations.},

Title = {A comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle approach for addressing
   construction design choices: An applicative case study for a residential
   tower in Aalborg, Denmark},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Energy demand reduction targets and sustainable design paradigms are
   fueling the search for more and more effective design solutions in the
   building sector, and new technologies and construction systems are being
   presented. However, each design solution has its own consequences for
   the environmental impact of the building. The use of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be
   profitably adopted for supporting the decision-making process. This
   paper reports a comparative methodology developed to analyse the impacts
   of alternative structural solutions for timber-based high-rise
   structures. Embodied, operational, and endof-life environmental impacts
   based on two structural frame types, a reinforced concrete (RC)
   structure and cross-laminated timber (CLT) are explored. Two main inputs
   are used for performing a comprehensive cradle-tograve LCA for the whole
   building: the bill of quantities from a Revit BIM model and the energy
   demand from DesignStudio. Then, an LCA is performed using the One Click
   LCA tool for a service life of 50 years and 12 impact categories. The
   environmental impacts of building materials are based on Environmental
   Product Declarations (EPDs) directly embedded in the tool. The method is
   then applied to a case study in Aalborg, Denmark. Results indicate that
   the total emissions for the considered case study are 9.6 kg- CO2
   eq./m2/y for the CLT structure against 10.8 kg- CO2 eq./m2/y for the RC
   structure. The production stage of building materials, including
   building systems and installations, accounts for around 55\% of the
   total emissions, while energy use (B6 phase) during the in-use stage of
   the building recorded a lower environmental impact (45\%). The outcomes
   confirm the opportunity to base the discussion on alternative design
   options on more objective and data-based elements to support the
   different positions which already involve a wide range of architectural,
   functional and financial criteria. This is of great relevance in
   achieving balanced and informed decisions which do not simply follow
   green-labelled ideas but are grounded on evidence-based considerations.},

Abstract = {Purpose Construction manufacturers predominantly rely upon antiquated
   manual design and production processes and procedures because they lack
   technical skills needed to automate working practices. This paper aims
   to automate manufacturing processes by optimising the utilisation of BIM
   digital objects (BDO) via the development of a conceptual model.
   Concomitant objectives seek to reduce design errors; eliminate
   unnecessary costs; automate the generation of quantity bills; and
   maximise productivity performance. Design/methodology/approach An
   inductive approach was adopted through a post positivist epistemological
   lens set within the context of a case study of a small- and medium-sized
   enterprise. From an operational perspective, both qualitative and
   quantitative data were collected and analysed via a novel four-phase
   waterfall design, namely, literature diagnosis; recording contemporary
   practice; mapping manufacturing workflow and procedures; and evaluation
   and proof of concept development. Findings The work illustrates that BDO
   enhances manufacturing workflow, reduces product manufacturing lead time
   and augments quality assurance throughout the whole life cycle of a
   manufactured product. The conceptual model developed provides a
   pragmatic and comprehensive solution to automate construction
   manufacturing procedures and to improve the facilitation of information
   exchanged between all stakeholders involved. Originality/value This
   study presents the first comprehensive case study of BDO application
   within a manufacturing context. Future research is however, needed to
   test and validate the conceptual model presented in practice. In doing
   so, the model can be further refined using practitioner input and
   real-life manufacturing processes and procedures.},

Abstract = {In the recent years the issue of BIM is gaining increased attention and
   there is a growing number of practical applications of BIM. The basis of
   BIM is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), 2013, published as
   International Standard ISO 16739: 2013. IFC constitute an open data
   format for data exchange between different types of software
   applications, used in design, construction and subsequent management of
   buildings (Facility Management), i.e. throughout their entire
   life-cycle. Authors created within the international project SE-Lab an
   application for data conversion to structural analysis (Structural
   Analysis View MVD). The structural data are converted from IFC standard
   to ATENA software input format, which is suitable for the nonlinear FEM
   analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures. The
   functionality of ATENA solution core has been extended in order to solve
   some of previously unsupported load types which are part of the IFC
   standards. Integration of the NLFEA with stochastic and degradation
   modeling allows to assess life-cycle reliability of civil engineering
   structures or structural elements.},

Abstract = {Buildings create a huge amount of information throughout their life
   cycle. The major information loss occurs during the building handover
   from the construction team to the owner. Communication of vast amount of
   information generated through the building life cycle is complex, error
   prone, and is insufficient, especially during commissioning stage,
   leading to unavailability of necessary information to the building owner
   and occupants. This research reviewed strengths and weaknesses of the
   current approaches to information management through the building life
   cycle. The research found that limited research has been focused on
   information management at the commissioning stage of construction and
   beyond. In addition, the research explored the requirements for adequate
   commissioning and digital technologies which can be used as potential
   solutions for efficient commissioning. It was found that digital
   technologies such as BIM, DT, AR, smart interactive system, and tools
   can lead to better communication and visualization of real-time building

Title = {An openBIM Approach to IoT Integration with Incomplete As-Built Data},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Featured Application
   The proposed methodology has been developed to support the Asset
   Management (AM) decision making according to an open Building
   Information Modelling (openBIM) approach. Within the context of the West
   Cambridge Digital Twin Research Facility, a real case scenario has been
   considered, where the as-built data is imprecise or absent. The
   methodology is well suited to dealing with incomplete data on existing
   buildings, when the objective is integration among AM, the Internet of
   Things (IoT) and BIM information.
   Digital Twins (DT) are powerful tools to support asset managers in the
   operation and maintenance of cognitive buildings. Building Information
   Models (BIM) are critical for Asset Management (AM), especially when
   used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) and other asset data
   collected throughout a building's lifecycle. However, information
   contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and
   incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling
   procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to
   develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with
   limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the
   use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the
   geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data
   integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT
   Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an
   asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the
   automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of
   BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the
   development of a building DT.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new adaptation of
   computer-aided technology used in Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC). Presently, BIM is one of the most talked-about
   concepts within the Built Environment (BE) sector. BIM comprises of 3D
   digital representation of a building system or subsystem, and it
   contains visual models of building integrated with database of building
   information especially the building fabrics and its components.
   Interestingly, with this particular function, BIM can definitely be
   integrated with Facilities Management (FM). However, the view of BIM
   within the Malaysia's FM arena is mixed as FM is seen slowly to engage
   with the development of BIM across the country. Though BIM might have
   emerged from the construction side of the built environment sector, but
   it must not be ignored by the FM stakeholders in any building life cycle
   project particularly after the construction project completed
   (Post-Construction Phase).The integration between BIM and FM have many
   positive effects and benefit as it capable of helping Facilities
   Managers to efficiently manage building, assets and facilities. Thus,
   this paper is trying to discuss definition and context of BIM in
   Malaysia; its benefits to close the computer-aided BIM-FM gap as well
   its impediments toward FM best practice excellence.},

Abstract = {The integration of operational information in building life-cycle
   management is a relevant topic within the facilities management domain.
   A previous study proposed a methodology based on Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and Facility Management (FM) systems integration,
   underpinned by a Performance Information Model, to support the
   performance assessment and the maintenance management. The purpose of
   this paper is to extend and validate that methodology with an open
   standard approach. A subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   schema related to performance assessment and maintenance procedures is
   mapped into a relational database. The database supports the integration
   between BIM models and facilities information systems. Case studies
   including healthcare buildings test the database and a new application.
   The results contribute to the BIM adoption in the FM domain. Also, the
   studied and validated IFC schema subset can be considered as a
   contribution to the Model View Definition for FM.},

   influence the deterioration of ceramic tiles on pitched roofs'; and iv)
   estimation of their service life. For that purpose, a sample of 85
   buildings and 146 claddings, with a total area of 43.992 m(2), were
   analysed. The service life prediction model proposed led to coherent and
   seemingly accurate results, providing crucial information for the
   adequate definition of maintenance strategies, thus optimizing funds and
   resources. The data related with the service life of the roof systems
   are fundamental for the development of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and
   Life Cycle Cost (LCC) tools, promoting the adoption of more sustainable
   solutions during the life cycle of buildings.},

Abstract = {The current lifecycle management of construction projects has long been
   plagued by the dilemma of ``lack of information{''} and ``information
   explosion{''}. This paper aims to develop a closed-loop lifecycle
   management system that can enable a consistent stream of information for
   use and reuse of all stakeholders. The framework integrates the
   state-of-the-art smart construction, construction automation and
   internet of things (IoT) technologies to help fragmented practitioners
   access and manage the information via a standardized interface among
   various applications throughout the whole lifecycle. Within the
   closed-loop lifecycle management system for IoT-based smart
   construction, digital technologies such as 3D laser scanner, drone,
   building information modelling (BIM), augmented reality (AR), Auto-ID,
   global positioning system (GPS), wireless sensor network (WSN),
   robotics, mobile digital devices, and web-based applications are used to
   collect proactive data from different stages. Further, the data are
   stored, shared, processed, and utilized in one unified platform for all
   stakeholders to support better decision- making and interaction
   throughout a project lifecycle. The framework is a guideline of
   real-time visualized tracking and operation, real-time environment
   supervision, real-time feedback and alarm, cloud backup, and data
   analysis demonstration which enable smart construction from head to toe.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) provides architectural 3D
   visualization and a standardized way to share and exchange building
   information. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using
   BIM, not only for design and construction, but also the
   post-construction management of the built facility. With the emergence
   of smart built environment (SBE) technology, which embeds most spaces
   with smart objects to enhance the building's efficiency, security and
   comfort of its occupants, there is a need to understand and address the
   challenges BIM faces in the design, construction and management of
   future smart buildings. In this paper, we investigate how BIM can
   contribute to the development of SBE. Since BIM is designed to host
   information of the building throughout its life cycle, our investigation
   has covered phases from architecture design to facility management.
   Firstly, we extend BIM for the design phase to provide material/device
   profiling and the information exchange interface for various smart
   objects. Next, we propose a three-layer verification framework to assist
   BIM users in identifying possible defects in their SBE design. For the
   post-construction phase, we have designed a facility management tool to
   provide advanced energy management of smart grid-connected SBEs, where
   smart objects, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) are
   deployed.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the findings of research on the environmental
   performance of two case-study houses, a retrofit and new build. The
   retrofit was completed to a Passivhaus standard while the new build was
   completed to current Irish building regulations. Environmental
   performance of the retrofit and new build was measured using life-cycle
   assessments, examining the assembly, operational and end-of-life stage
   over life spans of 50 and 80 years. Using primary information,
   life-cycle assessment software and life-cycle assessment databases the
   environmental impacts of each stage were modelled. The operational stage
   of both case studies was found to be the source of the most significant
   environmental damage, followed by the assembly and the end-of-life stage
   respectively. The relative importance of the assembly and end-of-life
   stage decreased as the life span increased. It was found that the
   retrofit house studied outperformed the new build in the assembly and
   operational stage, whereas the new build performed better in the
   end-of-life stage; however, this is highly sensitive, depending on the
   standards to which both are completed. Operational energy savings pre-
   and post-retrofit were significant, indicating the future potential for
   adoption of high-quality retrofitting practices.},

Abstract = {The building construction sector continues to be a major consumer of
   energy in the United States. Energy consumption in a building typically
   spans across various life-cycle phases such as the material production
   and constriction phase, use and maintenance phase, and the end-of- life
   phase, with the use and maintenance phase constituting around 80\% of
   total energy requirements. Since people spend most of their time
   indoors, the energy use behavior of building occupants is a critical
   factor that affects the total energy consumption. In this paper, an
   agent based model which simulates the effects of this dynamic occupant
   behavior is coupled with an energy use simulation model through a
   distributed computing environment based on the principles defined in the
   lightweight communications and marshalling (LCM), a common tool employed
   in robotics. The framework addresses two main objectives: (1) achieve
   multimodal synchronization and data exchange of distinct and spatially
   distributed simulation models and (2) visualize the effect of dynamic
   occupant behavior on the life cycle energy consumption in a building.
   This framework will achieve data synchronization and transfer of
   information between different software modules, which run simultaneously
   in a distributed fashion thereby testing the effects of various
   occupancy related energy interventions on life-cycle energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents an innovation in the

   environmental context, the management of buildings through BIM
   contributes to preserving resources and promoting more sustainable

   sustainability of buildings. The method consisted of applying Design
   Science Research (DSR) to develop a conceptual information model based

   assist in the CDW management activity. The conceptual model presented a
   perspective on application in CDW management and emphasized the
   importance of mapping information exchanges in BIM to optimize
   activities in civil construction. However, the results depend directly
   on the information available in the IFC model. The proposed conceptual
   model presents the potential to automate waste management with the
   flexibility of applying it to different phases of the construction life
   cycle. The results of CDW management can contribute to other types of

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to explore BIM (Building Information
   Modeling) applications in sustainable infrastructures. In response to
   the global warming, the shortage of energy resources, and the challenges
   of environmental degradation, humans are trying to build low-carbon
   Eco-cities and to popularize low-carbon green buildings. Building
   ``green{''}-refers to the entire life cycle of the building, which
   includes maximizing the conservation of resources (energy, water, land
   and materials), protecting the environment, reducing pollution,
   providing people with healthy, comfortable and efficient use of space,
   and establishing a harmony of nature and architecture. In the field of
   green and sustainable buildings, BIM can be integrated in analog-energy
   buildings, the air flow analysis and buildings' sunshine ecosystems. By
   using BIM it is possible to reduce waste and improve construction
   quality. BIM builds a ``visualization{''}of the digital building models
   through a multi-dimensional digital design solutions, which provide the
   ``simulation and analysis{''}of scientific collaboration platforms for
   designers, architects, utilities engineers, developers and even end
   users. Moreover, the BIM helps them to take advantage of
   three-dimensional digital models in design and construction of projects
   and operational management. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   analysis because of its high impact. The results show the preponderant
   role that concrete plays in the environmental impact. It is also
   observed that steel consumes less energy than concrete and provokes less
   CE as well. Moreover, it offers the possibility of recycling while
   reducing waste quantity. When analyzed by task, foundations present much
   less impact than the superstructure. Furthermore, each square meter of
   the typical housing block generates 76.11kg of CDW, being 75.77 kg of
   mixed waste, mainly concrete and 0.34 kg of steel waste.},

Title = {Sustainable Design Protocol in BIM Environments: Case Study of 3D
   Virtual Models of a Building in Seville (Spain) Based on BREEAM Method},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {One of the key problems facing the construction industry concerns the
   requirement to integrate sustainability criteria that effectively reduce
   the environmental impact throughout the lifecycles of buildings. For
   this, it is necessary to use digital tools with the capacity to evaluate
   the environmental performance of the different solutions proposed
   through the design process. In this context, the objective of this study
   was to establish a protocol of sustainable standards defined by the
   Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method
   (BREEAM), employing building information modeling (BIM) technology to
   simplify the integration of these indicators in the initial phases of
   the design process. This study focuses on a case study associated with
   the use of BIM technology and the BREEAM method. The results of the
   analysis enable us to define which of the BREEAM indicators can be
   integrated into and evaluated in BIM environments in the initial phase
   of the design process and to identify the environmental improvements and
   economic costs associated with these indicators. This study concludes
   that the indicators associated with the geometric and spatial definition
   of the building are the most influential in improving sustainability in
   the initial design phase, without requiring significant economic
   investment. In turn, these are easy parameters to evaluate using BIM,
   reducing design times compared to the use of traditional tools; this
   facilitates their involvement in the design phase and enables them to
   have a real impact on improving the environmental conditions of the
   final construction.},

Abstract = {Tools for whole Building Energy Simulation and Life Cycle Analyses are
   increasingly becoming more popular (and mandatory) in building design
   and facility management for analyzing building energy performance and
   environmental impact. A major barrier in deployment of these tools has
   been the lack of interoperability as their underlying data and
   mathematical models have escalated in complexity and consequently the
   demand for accurate precision data. The required analyses data exists,
   but in distributed, heterogonous data sources that require substantial
   manual preparation for use that is often the source of inaccurate and
   incomplete data model configuration. This paper introduces a Simulation
   Resource Framework facilitating access to energy-related resource
   libraries and design decision templates capturing many of the essential
   information for simulation model configuration e.g. weather data,
   occupancy activities, construction types and material properties. Such
   templates and resources may be especially helpful during early design
   stages where knowledge about the building's performance and components
   is limited and fundamental decisions need to be taken. The paper
   describes the overall concept and development approach of the framework
   and its integration in a broader Multi-Model environment enabling
   interoperability of BIM and any needed non-BIM resources in a virtual
   energy lab platform.},

Title = {Assessing Factors Affecting Fall Accidents among Hispanic Construction
   Workers: Integrating Safety Insights into BIM for Enhanced Life Cycle
   Management},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Falls are the most common type of accident in the construction industry,
   and falls to a lower level are among the leading causes of fatalities.
   Work-related fatalities due to falls, slips, and trips have been
   increasing, with Hispanic workers among the highest fatalities. This
   study investigated the association between fall accidents and attributes
   such as age, musculoskeletal pain (MSPs), sleep hours, safety knowledge,
   use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and working hours among
   Hispanic construction workers involved in building construction. This
   study collected 220 valid responses and used nonparametric chi-square
   tests and binary logistic regression to analyze the data. This study
   found that the location of the fall, MSPs, and use of personal
   protective equipment have a significant effect on the likelihood of
   having fall accidents. The strongest predictor of fall accidents was
   ``fall from a ladder{''}, followed by having two or three MSPs. The use
   of PPE had the highest decreasing ratio in odds of fall accidents,
   indicating the importance of wearing PPE properly. The results show the
   importance of integrating safety management strategies within
   construction projects' broader life cycle management. The insights list
   how project engineers can incorporate these findings into Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) systems to enhance project planning and
   safety measures in reducing fall-related accidents and their severe
   consequences. This study highlights the importance of addressing MSPs,
   properly using PPE, and reducing falls from ladders in the construction
   industry to prevent fall accidents among Hispanic workers and minimize
   their severe consequences.},

Abstract = {For the convenience of collaborative design, virtual construction,
   construction process simulation and management, Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) is becoming an important tool in civil engineering. The
   current BIM team seems to neglect the geotechnical aspect of the model,
   which can result in costly mistakes, especially when the project is
   infrastructure based. The barrier between the BIM team and the
   geotechnical data provider is the difficulty in extracting and
   assimilating data from the archived geotechnical data, which is mainly
   in the form of geotechnical investigation reports and geological
   sections. Furthermore, the geotechnical data exposed from the
   construction can not be linked to the original data conveniently to
   correct the interpretated errors in the geotechnical data, and the
   monitoring data cannot be combined with the original geotechnical data
   to find the development trend of the monitoring variables. All of this
   indicates that current management strategy of geotechnical data should
   be improved upon. Therefore, a management strategy that focuses on the
   full life cycle management of geotechnical data together with the BIM
   model to improve the accuracy of decision making in the design,
   construction, operation and management stages of a construction project
   is particularly important. In this paper, we put forward a management
   strategy of geotechnical data that can help to integrate geotechnical
   information into the BIM of a construction project in order to realize
   the full life cycle management of geotechnical information. In this
   strategy, the geotechnical data from the geotechnical investigation is
   archived in the form of a centralized geotechnical database and an
   informative geotechnical model. The centralized geotechnical database is
   targeted to manage the factual data, base data, result data, and
   metadata. The informative geotechnical model can facilitate the
   geotechnical being used in the three-dimensional visualization
   environment where the collaborative design and virtual construction are
   accomplished. We discuss the specific workflow of building a centralized
   geotechnical database and an informative geotechnical model. Finally, we
   use the management of the geotechnical data in a hydropower station for
   experimental studies to verify the proposed management strategy. The
   result shows that it is advantageous to manage the geotechnical data in
   the proposed management strategy for the BIM of a construction project.},

   information across the life-cycle of constructions. The present work
   aims at assessing the structural resilience of the existing building

   paper to perform structural analysis on existing buildings relying on
   the interoperability between Autodesk Revit and Robot Structural
   Analysis. Case study applications consist in two Reinforced Concrete
   (RC) frame structures in the Old Beichuan County (China), respectively,
   i.e., a residential building and a Hotel reception which were damaged by
   the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. Both structures have been architecturally
   characterized in Revit, followed by a modal analysis on the residential

Abstract = {Connectivity is key in this new era of smart infrastructure. Smart
   airports utilize new connected technologies to improve end-user
   experience while ensuring operational feasibility in aeronautical and
   non-aeronautical segments. The increasing need for digitizing the
   design-build-operate life cycles of airports can be met by implementing
   building information modeling (BIM) that enables accessing, managing,
   utilizing, and connecting physical and operational data in a digital
   collaborative environment. This study investigates the current state of
   practice in airport BIM (ABIM) and the use of ABIM processes in digital
   airport operations and maintenance by connecting existing data sources
   and integrating smart airport systems. The study proposes a
   comprehensive and adaptive ABIM management framework that depicts the
   alignment and connectivity of ABIM processes, resources and stakeholders
   with airport operational requirements by identifying gaps in the
   industry and literature, and developing a global understanding in ABIM
   visions. Research data are collected through literature and industry
   review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews with aviation
   professionals. Mixed methods including non-parametric statistical
   analysis and qualitative analysis are used to determine the elements of
   the framework. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) principles and
   language are used to generate the framework. For framework validation, a
   proof of concept (POC) is conducted by development and deployment of a
   web-based application. The developed ABIM framework is expected to guide
   major airport stakeholders in their BIM implementation processes to
   enhance airport operational efficiencies and in strategizing digital
   initiatives on a connected-BIM platform.},

Title = {Calculation of embodied GHG emissions in early building design stages
   using BIM and NLP-based semantic model healing},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {284},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {To reach the goals of limiting global warming, the embodied greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions of new buildings need to be quantified and optimized
   in the very early design stages, during which design decisions
   significantly influence the success of projects in achieving their
   performance goals. Semantically rich building information models (BIM)
   enable to perform an automated quantity take-off of the relevant
   elements for calculating a whole building life cycle assessment (LCA).
   However, imprecise type and property information often found in today's
   BIM practice hinders a seamless processing for downstream applications.
   At the same time, the early design stages are characterized by high
   uncertainty due to the lack of information and knowledge, making a
   holistic and consistent LCA for supporting design decisions and
   optimizing performance challenging. In assessing this often vague
   information, it is essential to consider different levels of element and
   material information for matching BIM to LCA data. For example, the
   structural properties of concrete are not yet defined in early design
   stages and should instead be considered as a range of material options
   due to different compressive strength classes. This paper presents a
   novel methodology for automatically matching the coarse information
   available in BIM models of the early design stages to the respective
   entries in LCA databases as a basis for a fully automated calculation
   process of the embodied GHG emissions of new buildings. This approach
   solves the existing gap in the automation process of manually enriching
   BIM models and adding information of LCA data and missing layers of
   vague models. In more detail, the proposed method is based on Natural
   Language Processing (NLP), using different strategies to increase
   performance in matching elements and materials from a BIM model to a
   knowledge database to enrich environmental indicators of commonly used
   elements' materials. The knowledge database contains all missing
   information for LCAs and has different levels of information for a range
   of several potential design options of elements and materials, including
   their dependencies. Accordingly, this paper investigates multiple NLP
   techniques and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art deep
   learning models such as GermaNet, SpaCy, or BERT. Following this, the
   most performant NLP approach is used to provide an automatic workflow
   for matching Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) elements to the knowledge
   database, facilitating a seamless LCA in the early stages of design. For
   five different case studies, the performances of the proposed matching
   method are analyzed. Finally, one case study is selected to compare the
   embodied emissions results to those of the conventional process.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technology, both Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) technology and lean construction concept
   became more and more widely applied in the engineering field in our
   country, meanwhile resulting in their prominent synergies with each

   at reducing wastes, saving costs, increasing productivity, and creating
   maximum value at the same time. Therefore, it will be more effective on
   value creation for their collaboration compared to their separate
   utilization from engineer perspective. This paper reports the combined
   technique between BIM technology and lean construction concept for its
   application in the cost management of engineering project of the
   building throughout the life-cycle among BIM mode, the lean cost
   analysis and control research. This combined technology is shown to be
   not only the main characteristic of construction enterprises but also
   the reference on improvement of production efficiency as well as

Abstract = {The objective of the research described in this paper is to integrate a
   decision-making framework for sustainable design of buildings with a
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) tool. Integration of a BIM model
   with a decision-making tool and sustainability metrics addresses the
   difficulties of making decisions earlier in the design/build process,
   and allows for specific sustainability trade-off analyses to be
   conducted, using the actual building conditions and characteristics. It
   is intended to improve the way data is utilized in a building throughout
   its life cycle, and to model the impact of design, maintenance,
   operations, and occupant behavior modification decisions made in an
   effort to improve the building's contribution to a sustainable
   infrastructure. Pertinent information contained within a BIM model is
   extracted, and utilized in decision-making related to operations,
   maintenance, and upgrades, and the development of `what-if' scenarios.
   Decision-makers will be able to evaluate options for improving their
   building's environmental sustainability performance. The research
   provides a new means for sharing data amongst various building modeling
   programs, and a new tool for making design decisions related to
   sustainable building design.},

Abstract = {The emergence of green buildings in China is later than other countries,
   and most of the green buildings are still following the traditional
   management methods in the operation and maintenance stage. However,
   compared with the traditional buildings, the structure and function of
   green buildings are more complicated, the traditional operation and
   maintenance management methods can no longer meet the requirements of
   green building management. The status quo of green building operation
   and maintenance management is in urgent need of improvement. BIM serves
   the whole life cycle of construction projects and is a direct
   application of information technology in the construction industry. Its
   application values have been widely recognized. By using the literature
   study method, the comparative analysis method and the inductive summary
   method, this paper analyzes how BIM technology can be used to evaluate
   and improve green building operation and maintenance management. The
   results show that the BIM technology has a high application value in
   improving information storage and inquiry; the BIM technology is a
   powerful tool for data statistical analysis; the BIM technology plays a
   significant role in improving green building evaluation efficiency and
   ensuring the objectivity and authenticity of the evaluation results.},

Abstract = {An integrated impact assessment model is used to calculate the impact
   per tonne of SO2, NOx, fine particles, and NMVOC emitted from different
   source countries on human health, acidification, eutrophication, and the
   man-made environment (crop yield and building materials). Indicators on
   the endpoint level are used to measure the effects resulting from a
   marginal change in emission levels. While the assessment of impacts on
   ecosystems and the man-made environment is limited to Europe, damage
   factors for health effects are also derived for Asia and South America.
   For Europe, emission scenarios for the years 1990 and 2010 are
   considered to analyse the influence of changing background conditions on
   the resulting impacts. Results show that there is a significant
   variation in the damage resulting from a unit emission for some of the
   impact categories, both between countries and between base years.
   Depending on the scope of the study and the information available from
   the life cycle inventory, results from the paper can be used to consider
   site dependent conditions in life cycle impact assessment as a
   complement to the current site-independent (or global) approach.},

Abstract = {Maintaining and operating building facilities constitutes a substantial
   portion of the overall life-cycle costs, which, if not befittingly
   handled, can yield immoderate expenditures and a shortfall of financial
   resources. The evidence implies that building facilities are degrading
   due to inadequate knowledge of building facilities and fallacious
   management procedures. This paper proposed a building information
   modeling (BIM) framework to enhance the effectiveness of BIM open
   standards for facility management operations. The study expands to
   creating a comprehensively integrated framework that provides a paradigm
   apropos to employing BIM capacities that manage and retrieve operation
   and maintenance (O\&M) data to engender a semantic repository of
   multiple existing building facilities and their peculiarities
   information. The proposed framework incorporates six chronological
   stages to ensure prime findings for the O\&M phase and unerringly
   exhibit the distinctive attributes of the maintenance data paradigm.
   Facilities managers can employ the presented framework as a blueprint
   for implementing the proposed strategy for incorporation, exploitation,
   and handling of building facilities-based knowledge throughout the O\&M
   phase into practice.},

Abstract = {Increasing the efficiency of coal preparation is the key link of mine
   production. This study proposed a framework of coal preparation for life
   cycle based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), in which the data
   resources can be retransmitted, and the integration of BIM application
   links has a high level. In this paper, the kappa big data processing
   architecture is used to realize the integration and unification of
   stream data and batch data processing process. By using deep learning
   method and multimodal data fusion method, the multimodal data
   association fusion is realized, and Bentley software is adopted for
   verification and integration. Taking a coal preparation plant as an
   engineering case study, the proposed framework is applied to build a big
   data subplatform of three-dimensional visual management. The following
   is suggested: (1) the three-dimensional visual review of the coal
   preparation online is realized, and the efficiency of the design results
   is improved; (2) the production and operation management of the coal
   preparation are carried out through the established platform, which
   indicated that the proportion of clean coal increased by 1.97\%, and the
   average increase percentage for the total output is about 5.6\%. Results
   from the case study show that the framework proposed in this study can
   provide efficient reference for coal washing in the coal preparation.},

Title = {Mineral resources in life cycle impact assessment-part I: a critical

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose The safeguard subject of the Area of Protection ``natural
   Resources,{''} particularly regarding mineral resources, has long been
   debated. Consequently, a variety of life cycle impact assessment methods
   based on different concepts are available. The Life Cycle Initiative,
   hosted by the UN Environment, established an expert task force on
   ``Mineral Resources{''} to review existing methods (this article) and
   provide guidance for application-dependent use of the methods and
   recommendations for further methodological development (Berger et al. in
   Int J Life Cycle Assess, 2020). Methods Starting in 2017, the task force
   developed a white paper, which served as its main input to a SETAC
   Pellston Workshop (R) in June 2018, in which a sub-group of the task
   force members developed recommendations for assessing impacts of mineral
   resource use in LCA. This article, based mainly on the white paper and
   pre-workshop discussions, presents a thorough review of 27 different
   life cycle impact assessment methods for mineral resource use in the
   ``natural resources{''} area of protection. The methods are categorized
   according to their basic impact mechanisms, described and compared, and
   assessed against a comprehensive set of criteria. Results and discussion
   Four method categories have been identified and their underlying
   concepts are described based on existing literature: depletion methods,
   future efforts methods, thermodynamic accounting methods, and supply
   risk methods. While we consider depletion and future efforts methods
   more ``traditional{''} life cycle impact assessment methods,
   thermodynamic accounting and supply risk methods are rather providing
   complementary information. Within each method category, differences
   between methods are discussed in detail, which allows for further
   sub-categorization and better understanding of what the methods actually
   assess. Conclusions We provide a thorough review of existing life cycle
   impact assessment methods addressing impacts of mineral resource use,
   covering a broad overview of basic impact mechanisms to a detailed
   discussion of method-specific modeling. This supports a better
   understanding of what the methods actually assess and highlights their
   strengths and limitations. Building on these insights, Berger et al.
   (Int J Life Cycle Assess, 2020) provide recommendations for
   application-dependent use of the methods, along with recommendations for
   further methodological development.},

Title = {Integration between BIM and EPDs: Evaluation of the main difficulties
   and proposal of a framework based on ISO 19650:2018},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO)
   industry largely contributes to the global environmental crisis, and
   there is an urgent need to reduce buildings' environmental impacts. Life
   cycle assessment (LCA) is considered the most appropriate methodology
   for this purpose due to the reliability and comprehensiveness of its
   analytical qualifications; but, due to the complexity of this
   methodology, LCA becomes time-consuming, generating resistance to its
   application. In addition, a quality LCA requires reliable, transparent,
   and comparable empirical data. To solve input data reliability and
   agility problems in the LCA applying process, the envi-ronmental product
   declaration (EPD) and the building information modeling (BIM) can be
   used, respectively. The interaction between these two concepts requires
   an association of processes for information standardization. Using ISO
   19650: 2018 as the basis for analysis, through a system-atic literature
   review (SLR), this article sought to identify difficulties in the
   BIM-EPD interaction considering: (1) standardization of processes and
   (2) integration between tools. Finally, a frame-work for an integrated
   EPD evaluation via BIM is proposed. The results indicate that EPDs'
   infor-mation types should allow consistent comparability among products
   for different project stages within the context of a dynamic LCA. The
   information must consider all building temporal stages, demonstrating
   that the aspects contributing to integration between the tools are
   related to stan-dardization, level of detail, and interoperability.
   These aspects act as filters for the generality of the requirements
   established by ISO 19650:2018 to meet the specificities required by the
   use re-lationship between BIM-EPD. This study and the developed
   framework bring important contribu-tions to BIM-LCA-EPD practitioners
   and AECO actors that help develop integrated and compati-ble BIM-EPD
   methodologies and tools.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Water efficiency certification systems ease communication between all
   interested parties of building projects but do not provide information
   about the life cycle costs of water efficiency measures nor warrant a
   level of water efficiency performance. The present study aims at
   understanding of the effective performance of water efficiency solutions
   in commercial buildings by reporting and analyzing a specific case study
   - Colombo Shopping Center. The water efficiency measures implemented in
   Colombo Shopping Center were the following: (i) in 2008, the restrooms
   fixtures were replaced by more efficient models; (ii) in 2011, a
   rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) was introduced for supplying the
   cogeneration plant; and (iii) also in 2011, a greywater reuse system
   (GWS) was installed to use the cooling towers purged water to supply the
   toilets of four restrooms. The methodology included collecting the water
   metering records and the accounting archives since 2006, assessing the
   water savings and evaluating the partial life cycle costs of each
   measure. The partial life cycle cost analysis covers the acquisition and
   the first years of the operation and maintenance stages. The restroom
   fixtures present the highest annual water savings along with longest
   payback period (> 15 years), since both the investment and maintenance
   costs are high. The estimated payback period for the RWHS is roughly 10
   years. The GWS was paid in just over 2 years and has annual water
   savings similar to the RWHS.},

   manufacturing, occupying, and maintenance, involve vast amounts of data
   that is used for a wide variety of purposes. Building information
   modeling (BIM) is a powerful shared knowledge resource which stores this
   data to support decision making about a facility through all these
   different phases in its life cycle.
   The primary purpose of review paper is to discuss the various research
   done till date by researchers and understand the future scope and
   analyze the current state of interoperability among architecture,
   engineering, and construction software applications utilized in Building
   Information Modeling and implication of standards in this area. This
   application is widely accepted throughout the industry in many countries
   for managing project information with capabilities for cost control and
   facilities management},

Title = {LCA Analysis Through a Visual Programming Tool: Workflow on a BIM Model
   Case Study},

Abstract = {BIM tools also allow to conduct various impact analysis and, with regard
   to the growing concern about environmental issues, they embody a
   valuable mean to analyse buildings process consequences thus guiding
   designers towards better and more aware choices.
   The capacity of BIM applications to evaluate environmental issues would
   be enhanced if integrated with Life- Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools
   considered among the most suitable methods for evaluating such impacts.
   However, a typical barrier in performing LCA during the early design
   stages, i.e. the moment that influence the most the project outputs, is
   the lack of project information. Usually, this implies LCA to be
   performed after the design phase, when all the significant decisions are
   already taken.
   The implementation of LCA within the early stages of the design process,
   possibly through an automated method, can enhance the control of
   environmental variables hence, the integration of BIM and LCA, appears
   to be a suitable opportunity.
   The parametric approach allows BIM-based software to collect data and
   connect them with model elements. In order to avoid manual compilation
   of complex records, Visual Programming tools can cooperate with the
   authoring BIM software and interrelate the model with external sources
   such as materials environmental impact databases. Moreover, they can be
   configured to perform complex LCA calculation and automatically update
   the outcomes when something in the model changes.
   The goal of this paper is to propose a sample workflow applied to a case
   study, in order to provide AEC stakeholders with a simplified BIM-based
   method for easily detecting the potential consequence of undertaking
   certain design choices at initial project stages or, at least, at those
   phases when definitive materials and products selection occurs.},

Title = {Internet of Things for building facade traceability: A theoretical
   framework to enable circular economy through life-cycle information
   flows},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {382},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Traceability is considered a crucial requirement to enable Circular
   Economy (CE). Product and process life-cycle data can facilitate
   circular asset management preserving the asset's value over time and
   reducing resource consumption. Many scholars point out how the loss of
   traceability data, lacking information reliability, and unstructured
   data are still barriers to the widespread application of CE. In the
   building facade sector, an increased interest on traceability is
   dictated by a growing demand for environmental product certifications.
   However, these aspects are often limited to collect data at supply chain
   stage, thus neglecting a huge amount of information produced during the
   asset service life. To foster an accessible and life-cycle oriented
   asset traceability, this research investigates the Internet of Things
   (IoT) as a potentially disruptive technology for supporting information
   management. The objective of this work is twofold: (i) to identify what
   facade life-cycle information is needed to promote CE and (ii) to
   clarify the enabling role of IoT in tracking, storing, and sharing such
   information. Through a scoping review combined with interviews to
   professionals, a theoretical framework structured on four key elements
   (stakeholders, information list, information management tools, and IoT)
   is proposed to fill the literature gap and support facade industry in
   the circular transition. Further research will have to be conducted to
   face the digital-physical integration issues and develop business models
   able to fully exploit traceability information value.},

Title = {Challenges and opportunities for integrating BIM and LCA: Methodological
   choices and framework development},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The main objectives of this review are to identify the advanced
   strategies and research gaps in the integration of BIM-LCA approaches
   and to propose research opportunities for promoting the progress of
   BIM-based LCA. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was
   conducted. Considering the ISO standard framework for conducting LCA, we
   analyzed the published articles based on the type of input data, data
   exchanging process, output results, and method of storing environmental
   information. The results suggest that BIM-LCA research studies mostly
   focused on manual and semi-automatic solutions at the initial design
   phases, although there is a growing trend towards the automatic
   compilation of data exchange. Also, not all aspects of variations in the
   design have been addressed yet to enhance the validity of results and to
   complete the automation of the LCA process. Furthermore, there is an
   extensive area of opportunity for developing and integrating local LCA
   database following the level of development (LOD) models, integrating
   sensitivity analysis in the design process and, comparing different LODs
   to provide a guideline for early-stage decision-making concerning the
   construction phase results. The development of a comprehensive framework
   for assessing different sources of uncertainty and variability for
   BIM-LCA models seems necessary to achieve a robust decision on
   eco-friendly solutions.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment evaluation of green product labeling systems for
   residential construction},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {753-763},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool that can be utilized to
   holistically evaluate novel trends in the construction industry and the
   associated environmental impacts. Green labels are awarded by several
   organizations based on single or multiple attributes. The use of
   multi-criteria labels is a good start to the labeling process as opposed
   to single criteria labels that ignore a majority of impacts from
   products. Life cycle thinking, in theory, has the potential to improve
   the environmental impacts of labeling systems. However, LCA databases
   currently are lacking in detailed information about products or
   sometimes provide conflicting information.
   This study compares generic and green-labeled carpets, paints, and
   linoleum flooring using the Building for Environmental and Economic
   Sustainability (BEES) LCA database. The results from these comparisons
   are not intuitive and are contradictory in several impact categories
   with respect to the greenness of the product. Other data sources such as
   environmental product declarations and ecoinvent are also compared with
   the BEES data to compare the results and display the disparity in the
   databases.
   This study shows that partial LCAs focused on the production and
   transportation phase help in identifying improvements in the product
   itself and improving the manufacturing process but the results are
   uncertain and dependent upon the source or database. Inconsistencies in
   the data and missing categories add to the ambiguity in LCA results.
   While life cycle thinking in concept can improve the green labeling
   systems available, LCA data is lacking. Therefore, LCA data and tools
   need to improve to support and enable market trends.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is one of the most polluting industries,
   generating between 30\% and 40\% of the worldwide environmental burden
   in terms of raw materials, direct and indirect energy consumption,
   waste, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in computer science and data
   management have facilitated the evaluation of present and future
   impacts, thus improving the sustainability of architectural designs.
   Powerful software tools, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM),
   allow environmental indicators to be incorporated into the construction
   elements that make up the project to evaluate it during the design
   stage. In this work, the state of the art of ecological indicator
   application through BIM platforms is studied. Barriers and uncertainties
   are also identified. Subsequently, a model is proposed to evaluate the
   environmental impact of an urbanization process or a project through
   several ecological indicators (carbon footprint, water footprint, and
   embodied energy). To perform this analysis, the most important aspect is
   to determine the quantities of each construction element and their clear
   decomposition into subelements, since both aspects add certainty to the
   analysis. For this purpose, construction cost databases are a good
   instrument for introducing environmental awareness. The reliability of
   LCA data, which can be obtained from generic databases or ecolabels such
   as environmental product declarations, becomes crucial.},

Abstract = {Existing tools for environmental certification of buildings are failing
   in their ability to reach the general public and to create social
   awareness, since they require not only specialized knowledge regarding
   construction and energy sources, but also environmental knowledge. In
   this paper, an open-source online tool for the estimation of the carbon
   footprint of residential buildings by non-specialized users is presented
   as a product from the OERCO2 Erasmus + project. The internal
   calculations, data management and operation of this tool are extensively
   explained. The ten most common building typologies built in the last
   decade in Spain are analysed by using the OERCO2 tool, and the order of
   magnitude of the results is analysed by comparing them to the ranges
   determined by other authors. The OERCO2 tool proves itself to be
   reliable, with its results falling within the defined logical value
   ranges. Moreover, the major simplification of the interface allows
   non-specialized users to evaluate the sustainability of buildings.
   Further research is oriented towards its inclusion in other
   environmental certification tools and in Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) environments.},

Abstract = {The lightweight and recyclable characteristics of steel structure can
   greatly reduce environmental damage. However, there are limited research
   studies examining the carbon footprint of steel structure with advanced
   technology, for example, building information modeling (BIM). BIM
   provides a cloud platform to perform data interaction and various
   simulations at the beginning of project. This paper aims to develop a
   BIM-based method to evaluate the potential of carbon footprint reduction
   during the materialization stage of steel structure (compared with
   concrete-steel structure). Taking two public buildings in Beijing as
   examples for this study, the carbon footprints of different materials
   were calculated. This study provides a systematic and efficient BIM
   approach to measure the carbon footprint of new buildings and the
   reduction potential of steel structure. It provides valuable assets for
   helping governments, constructors, and designers to achieve sustainable
   construction.},

Title = {Application of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) to environmental,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) can help to predict the
   impact of products and services, such as buildings, during their entire
   life cycle. However, it is an extensive data method. The Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) method can contribute towards reducing the
   effort involved and simplifying the data collection relating to the
   building elements. To this end, databases adjusted to the BIM workflow
   are needed to systematise and harmonise the structure of the
   environmental, economic and social data of said elements. This paper
   provides a solution to this problem by presenting an innovative Triple
   Bottom Line (TBL) database with environmental, economic, and social
   indicators of building elements to support the triple assessment adapted
   to the BIM workflow. An analysis employing Knowledge Discovery in
   Databases (KDD) was performed for the first time on this type of
   database to better understand the correlations between the dimensions.
   The key contributions include correlation detection, 83 \% of which were
   direct, which showed that, overall, the environmental (CO 2 emissions),
   economic (cost), and social (labour) dimensions experience similar
   growth trends. Strong correlations between economic and social variables
   were found in 68 \% of the cases, followed by those of the economic and
   environmental (32 \%), and social and environmental (18 \%) variables.
   Findings from the correlation analysis between the three dimensions
   reveal their influence on the type of building system, element and
   material. Four scenarios were thereby identified in accordance with
   these correlations, to aid in sustainable decision-making. Various
   growth trends were detected, which can facilitate the implementation of
   the LCSA.},

Title = {RISK MODEL FOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE CONTRACTING IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-82},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Energy performance contracting provides guaranteed minimum energy
   savings to building owners, enabling them to finance project costs using
   utility savings over the duration of the project. This has been an
   attractive project delivery method for organizations with reduced
   budgets for capital projects, particularly among correctional facilities
   which frequently have lengthy periods of deferred maintenance and
   ongoing building operations and maintenance concerns. This research
   builds on a previously developed project factors risk framework for
   energy service companies undertaking building retrofits. This paper
   proposes a risk analysis and evaluation model that includes
   quantitative, expert-based, and probabilistically derived information.
   Expected cost was used to evaluate risks over lengthy project life
   cycles and a new metric was developed for use in the model-expected life
   cycle value. Model results reveal that the most critical risk factors
   relate to the reduced availability of ``low-hanging fruit{''} energy
   conservation measures, work scopes based on traditional design-bid-build
   procurement, unavailable or inaccurate facility information, facility
   age and current code requirements, and conducting the investment grade
   audit too quickly. The life cycle cost-based risk model employed in this
   paper is proposed as an advancement over traditional risk management
   methods, and it is expected to be applicable, with modification, across
   other municipal and state government subdomains, especially high
   security projects.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {145},
Number = {3},
Pages = {908-943},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We study the structure of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a dynamic
   Mirrlees economy with endogenous distribution of skills. Human capital
   is a private, stochastic state variable that drives the skill process of
   each individual. Building on the findings of the labor literature, we
   construct a tractable life-cycle model of human capital evolution with
   risky investment and stochastic depreciation. In this setting, we
   demonstrate the optimality of (a) a human capital premium, i.e., an
   excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, (b) a large
   intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle, and (c) a non-zero
   intratemporal wedge even at the top of the skill distribution at all
   dates except the last date in the life-cycle. The main implication for
   the structure of optimal linear capital taxes is the necessity of
   deferred taxation of physical capital. The average marginal tax rate on
   physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. However,
   expected capital tax payments do not equal zero in every period.
   Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments early in
   the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the
   life-cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   The mapping of the current impact and benefits of BIM showed that the
   role of the managers, suppliers, owners and authorities is
   underestimated, as well as the initiation and use stage of project
   development. At the same time, the performance in the AEC industry can
   be improved by an array of possibilities where IT research and

Abstract = {The reduction of energy consumption of buildings requires consideration
   in early design phases. However, modelling and computation time required
   for dynamic energy simulations makes them inappropriate in the early
   phases. This paper presents a performance prediction approach for these
   phases that is embedded in a multi-level-of-development modelling
   approach. First, parametric pre-trained modular deep learning components
   are embedded in the building elements. The energy performance is
   predicted by composing these components. Second, embodied energy
   assessment is performed by extracting the information from a database. A
   calculation module queries the database and calculates the embodied
   energy. Both, embodied and operational, energy are assembled to predict
   lifecycle energy demand. The method has been implemented prototypically
   in a digital modelling environment Revit. A case study serves to
   demonstrate the application process, the user interaction and the
   information flows. It shows energy prediction in early design phases to
   enhance the environmental performance of the building.},

Title = {Achieving a Trade-Off Construction Solution Using BIM, an Optimization

Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The Energy Performance of Building Directive obligated all European
   countries to reduce the energy requirements of buildings while
   simultaneously improving indoor environment quality. Any such
   improvements not only enhance the health of the occupants and their
   productivity, but also provide further economic benefits at the national
   level. Accomplishing this task requires a method that allows building
   professionals to resolve conflicts between visual and thermal comfort,
   energy demands, and life-cycle costs. To overcome these conflicts, this
   study exploits the incorporation of building information modelling
   (BIM), the design of experiments as an optimization algorithm, and the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP) into a multi-criteria decision-making
   method. Any such incorporation can (i) create constructive communication
   between building professionals, such as architects, engineers, and
   energy experts; (ii) allow the analysis of the performance of multiple
   construction solutions with respect to visual and thermal comfort,
   energy demand, and life-cycle costs; and (iii) help to select a
   trade-off solution, thereby making a suitable decision. Three types of
   energy-efficient windows, and five types of ground floors, roofs, and
   external wall constructions were considered as optimization variables.
   The incorporation of several methods allowed the analysis of the
   performance of 375 construction solutions based on a combination of
   optimization variables, and helped to select a trade-off solution. The
   results showed the strength of incorporation for analyzing big-data
   through the intelligent use of BIM and a simulation in the field of the
   built environment, energy, and costs. However, when applying AHP, the
   results are strongly contingent on pairwise comparisons.},

Abstract = {Digitization in the construction industry is advancing, the topic of BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) is on everyone's lips, and many
   companies and projects are gaining their first experience with the
   digital working method. The processes in the life cycle of a
   construction facility (or use cases of digital methods) can efficiently
   deliver quality results when data from other sources such as schedules,
   documents, digital acceptance forms or from installed sensors are linked
   with each other. It is all about transparency and breaking down data
   silos. One example of this is the higher-level management of
   contractually agreed customer requirements. With the help of
   consistently structured data models, the silos of current and future
   processes are overcome, thus creating end-to-end transparency. As a
   result, more data and information is available for more informed
   decisions and better risk management. In addition, a unified data model
   enables a reduction of dependencies through the software systems used -
   data interoperability can be better ensured in different project
   scenarios. This has an impact on the management of individual projects
   as well as comparability and control across project boundaries. To
   harness these added values, far from technological prerequisites, new
   competencies are needed to drive data-driven ways of thinking and
   working among all stakeholders of a project. This can pave the way for a
   true digital twin in all lifecycle phases of structural assets.
   Efficient and informed decision-making is a lever to meet the challenges
   of major changes in all areas of construction, especially also the
   sustainable change in transport and energy infrastructure.},

Title = {Optimizing ventilation systems considering operational and embodied
   emissions with life cycle based method},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {325},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Efforts to enhance the energy efficiency of heating, ventilation, and
   air conditioning (HVAC) systems have been bolstered by technical
   advancements and stringent regulations. However, HVAC systems not only
   emit during operation due to energy consumption but also have
   significant embodied emissions, which recent studies show can exceed
   those of the operational phase. This study introduces an optimization
   framework aimed at minimizing lifetime emissions-both operational and
   embodied-for ventilation systems, an area previously underexplored. The
   optimization framework incorporates detailed calculations of pressure
   drop, fan power and newly developed life cycle ventilation inventory
   data with a life cycle assessment perspective. A case study of
   ventilation ductwork in a ``BREEAM Excellent{''} certified
   energy-efficient building in Norway demonstrates the application of this
   optimization framework. Findings indicate that for this case, optimizing
   ductwork dimensions can reduce lifetime emissions of the ventilation
   system by 15 \%, compared to the existing designs with an emission
   intensity of 0.3 kg CO2/kWh. Further, the study examines how the
   emission intensity of electricity generation and service lifetime
   influence total emissions, highlighting the growing importance of
   embodied emissions as electricity generation becomes cleaner. This
   underscores the necessity of considering both operational and embodied
   emissions in design decisions. This study presents an optimization tool
   for low- emissions ventilation design, capable of processing diverse
   layouts and aiding in decarbonizing ventilation systems towards
   achieving zero-emission buildings. Future integration with building
   information modeling (BIM) and artificial intelligence (AI) could
   further enhance autonomous low-carbon design and decision-making.},

Title = {Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Light Steel Framed Buildings with
   Cement-Based Walls and Floors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to apply the life cycle assessment
   methodology to assess the environmental impacts of light steel framed
   buildings fabricated from cold formed steel (CFS) sections. The
   assessment covers all phases over the life span of the building from
   material production, construction, use, and the end of building life, in
   addition to loads and benefits from reuse/recycling after building
   disposal. The life cycle inventory and environmental impact indicators
   are estimated using the Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings. The input
   data related to the building materials used are extracted from a
   building information model of the building while the operating energy in
   the use phase is calculated using an energy simulation software. The
   Athena Impact Estimator calculates the following mid-point environmental
   measures: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, human
   health potential, ozone depletion potential, smog potential,
   eutrophication potential, primary and non-renewable energy (PE)
   consumption, and fossil fuel consumption. The LCA assessment was applied
   to a case study of a university building. Results of the case study
   related to GWP and PE were as follows. The building foundations were
   responsible for 29\% of the embodied GWP and 20\% of the embodied PE,
   while the CFS skeleton was responsible for 30\% of the embodied GWP and
   49\% of the embodied PE. The production stage was responsible for 90\%
   of the embodied GWP and embodied PE. When benefits associated with
   recycling/reuse were included in the analysis according to Module D of
   EN 15978, the embodied GWP was reduced by 15.4\% while the embodied PE
   was reduced by 6.22\%. Compared with conventional construction systems,
   the CFS framing systems had much lower embodied GWP and PE.},

Title = {Building digital twinning: Data, information, and models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel framework and methodology for building
   digital twinning (BDT) over the life cycle of a building. It aims to
   establish an intrinsic digital twin framework and methodology in the
   building sector, considering the inherent characteristics of the
   building industry compared with other industries, such as manufacturing.
   Thus, the framework includes digital twin elements, functional
   requirements, and enabling techniques and provides in-depth insight into
   the implementation of digital twin modeling for building operations. The
   key elements comprise data, information, and mathematical models. In
   terms of the elements, functional requirements include transfer,
   extension/augmentation, and correction/update. These requirements are
   identified and discussed, and enabling techniques are selected and
   orchestrated to establish digital twins and fulfill the requirements.
   Digital twin modeling methodologies and strategies are suggested for
   each building life cycle stage (i.e., design, commissioning, and
   operation) in terms of data, information, and models (DIM) to overcome
   the challenges of digital twinning for real building operations. Future
   research directions are discussed to realize building digitalization.},

Abstract = {New developments in software projects for the construction sector are a
   technological revolution and provide new methods of infrastructure

   minimizing costs. The advantages of using BIM stand out in large
   projects thanks to the better handling of large volumes of information.
   This article will address, with the example of using BIM technology, the
   design project of a fictitious university sports pavilion located in
   Seville (Spain). Using the BIM Edificius(R) software, the 3D modeling of
   this building will be carried out in order to calculate and design the

Title = {Integrating BIM and Blockchain across construction lifecycle and supply
   chains},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties
   involved, which often leads to ``adversarial relationships{''}, ``risk
   avoidance{''}, and a ``lack of trust{''}among the different actors. This
   culture is further compounded by a ``linear workflow{''}that often
   results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste.
   Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a
   decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have
   access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the
   different stages of the project, and even automate some processes
   increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study
   highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it
   can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing
   multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent
   way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the
   likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper
   explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and
   supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to
   streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource
   traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a
   detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction
   industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore,
   this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and
   Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the
   smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus
   providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this
   integration.},

   contracts with regard to envisaged BIM uses (dimensions), making BIM
   implementation superficial rather than purposive. This study identified
   BIM dimension-specific contract provisions (BDSCP) to address this gap.
   To accomplish this, a literature review was undertaken; this was
   followed by a qualitative inductive study involving 12 international
   experts from industry and academia to identify BDSCPs. The resulting 28
   BDSCPs highlight focus areas with regard to drafting contracts and will
   assist stakeholders in realizing the benefits of BIM implementation. (C)

Title = {Applications of Building information modelling in the early design stage

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {High-rise buildings consume more energy and have greater environmental
   impacts, emphasising the need to adopt best practices during the design
   stage concerning BIM employment. However, despite strong support from
   the literature, little is known about the applications of BIM in
   high-rise buildings at the early design stage. Therefore, this paper
   aims to provide a holistic understanding of the current applications of
   BIM in high-rise buildings by analysing 60 studies. The findings
   identified seven research themes, including studies that used BIM for i)
   optimising building energy efficiency design; ii) collaborative design
   and planning; iii) life-cycle assessment; iv) designing net-zero energy
   buildings; v) integrating BIM with smart technologies for designing
   high-rise buildings; vi) cost analysis, and vii) structural design of
   high-rise buildings. Furthermore, this study highlights a number of
   challenges hindering the widespread application of BIM, alongside
   providing potential directions for the future development of BIM
   employment in high-rise buildings.},

Title = {Biodiversity impact assessment of building's roofs based on Life Cycle
   Assessment methods},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {133-144},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To fight against the biodiversity loss and to take advantage of
   ecosystem services that nature can offer, urban planners integrate green
   spaces in urban projects. However to assess green spaces, attention is
   generally paid to local biodiversity (i.e. ``in situ{''}) which concerns
   the plot on which buildings are constructed. The biodiversity impacted
   outside the construction site (i.e. ``ex situ{''}) which concerns the
   extraction of materials, transportation and waste, is rarely associated
   to the project assessment.
   In this study, two endpoint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are
   applied: ReCiPe 2016 and Impact World + to assess a conventional roof
   and three different types of green roofs. As Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)
   data about urban plants are missing, we created new data to model the
   vegetation layer of green roofs by collecting information nearby plants
   nursery.
   This work shows that 1) extensive green roof generates the least
   biodiversity loss, 2) ``ex situ{''} biodiversity is 10 times more
   impacted than ``in situ{''} biodiversity, 3) the impact of the
   vegetation layer on the biodiversity loss is significant.
   LCA methods do not enable to cover all pressures threatening
   biodiversity and they also lack precision to assess ``in situ{''}
   biodiversity. Nevertheless, their main strength is to consider ``ex
   situ{''} biodiversity along the value chain of the studied systems.
   Coupling LCA with ecological expertise should improve the assessment by
   taking into account local specificities and both negative and positive
   impacts of a system (e.g. ``in situ{''} biodiversity gains with green
   roofs).},

Title = {Early design phase energy predictions using a semi-dynamic approach as
   an accurate proxy for dynamic energy simulations},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The building sector is well known as one of the significant contributors
   to climate change. The use of materials and energy are important
   drivers, both during construction and the whole life cycle. This study
   is part of a research to improve the Belgian national approach of life
   cycle environmental assessment for buildings. The current approach
   focusses mainly on material use, and the operational energy is estimated
   via the equivalent degree day method assuming a fixed value of 1200
   equivalent heating degree days per year. This paper extends this
   widespread degree day approach to improve its accuracy by including the
   effect of various parameters (climate, building characteristics,
   obstructions by the environment, occupant behaviour). Step by step
   user-friendly input and graphical feedback is moreover considered
   necessary for designers and has been added. The annual heating energy
   estimated by our proposed semi -dynamic model has been validated by
   dynamic energy simulations using EnergyPlus of 8000 randomly generated
   cases. Both results have been plotted in a 2D graph. The slope of the
   linear regression through the origin is 0.8955, and the R -square value
   is 0.9058. Based on this comparison, it is concluded that the
   semidynamic model, with simplified input and fast results, has
   sufficient accuracy for the first design phases compared to the dynamic
   model. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has brought a technological shift in
   the area of construction programs, resulting in a significant rise in
   project management performance and affordability. In Bangladesh,
   designers have to deal with numerous issues in implementing BIM
   technology as technological expertise is insufficient in this area.
   Therefore, the paper focuses on implementing BIM across the project life
   cycle and assesses its effectiveness on a construction project with
   respect to the Bangladeshi construction industry. For this, a 3D model
   simulation of a three-storied residential building is developed and all
   semantic data (material properties, construction details, schedules,
   cost of the material, etc.) is stored with the model. In addition,
   BIM-centered integrated project delivery techniques are analyzed for
   clash detection, structural analysis, scheduling (4D), and cost
   estimation (5D) during the planning and construction phase. The outcome
   of the study indicated that BIM is effective in raising whole process
   performance, giving precise quantity takeoffs, optimizing schedules,
   reducing overall project uncertainties, structural defects, and
   expenses. The constitutional framework of this study can lead to
   increased efficiency, effective communication, as well as rarer mistakes
   in the construction project of Bangladesh. In addition, it can be an
   effective tool for managing medium-and large-scale projects since it can
   help to boost profitability, cut expenses, and enhance time management.},

   more frequent use of computer software tools such as BIM for this
   purpose. Computer-aided modeling makes it possible to simulate buildings

Title = {WaLA, a versatile model for the life cycle assessment of urban water
   systems: Formalism and framework for a modular approach},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {69-82},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The emphasis on the sustainable urban water management has increased
   over the last decades. In this context decision makers need tools to
   measure and improve the environmental performance of urban water systems
   (UWS) and their related scenarios. In this paper, we propose a versatile
   model, named WaLA (Water system Life cycle Assessment), which reduces
   the complexity of the UWS while ensuring a good representation of water
   issues and fulfilling life cycle assessment (LCA) requirements. Indeed,
   LCAs require building UWS models, which can be tedious if several
   scenarios are to be compared. The WaLA model is based on a framework
   that uses a ``generic component{''} representing alternately water
   technology units and water users, with their associated water flows, and
   the associated impacts due to water deprivation, emissions, operation
   and infrastructure. UWS scenarios can be built by inter-operating and
   connecting the technologies and users components in a modular and
   integrated way. The model calculates life cycle impacts at a monthly
   temporal resolution for a set of services provided to users, as defined
   by the scenario. It also provides the ratio of impacts to amount of
   services provided and useful information for UWS diagnosis or comparison
   of different scenarios. The model is implemented in a Matlab/Simulink
   interface thanks to object-oriented programming. The applicability of
   the model is demonstrated using a virtual case study based on available
   life cycle inventory data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Construction industry is a significant contributor to global
   environmental impact, with large amount of energy being utilized in the
   production and transportation processes of various building materials.
   Energy conservation in buildings becomes a critical factor in reducing
   the greenhouse emissions and at the same time focusing on reducing the
   cost of materials. By using digital tools of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)
   and Building Information Modelling (BIM) techniques, the ecological
   collisions can be measured and lowered through analysis of alternative
   eco-friendly materials. In this study, a BIM-based LCA was carried out
   for a case study residential building to be constructed with
   conventional materials, located in the warm-humid climate region of
   India. The findings revealed that roof slab constructed with rein-forced
   concrete is contributing more carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) next to
   vertical facade in terms of environmental impacts, energy consumptions
   and global warming potential. An analytical study was performed on
   alternative building materials with walls being replaced with AAC blocks
   and roof slab with clay tiles, cool tiles, terrazzo tiles as insulation
   layers. The roofs and walls replaced with alternate materials showed
   2-6\% reduction in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, acidification,
   eutrophication, and ozone depletion potentials. Copyright (C) 2022

Title = {Carbon assessment of building shell options for eco self-build community
   housing through the integration of building energy modelling and life
   cycle analysis tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {To achieve the UK's net-zero carbon transition by 2050, new homes need
   to be designed to high energy efficiency standards and minimise life
   cycle carbon emissions. This study develops a method that integrates
   building energy modelling (BEM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools,
   IES Virtual Environment (IES VE) and One Click LCA, to conduct a life
   cycle assessment of the operational and embodied carbon impacts of a
   typical terraced building shell in an eco self-build community housing
   (ESBC) project, using Water Lilies as a case study. It evaluates and
   compares the 60-year life cycle carbon impacts of six design options
   that apply different insulation materials to the case study building
   shell. The results are based on grid-connected Future Energy Scenarios
   (FES) that have different carbon intensities predicted over time and the
   microgrid-connected Water Lilies Community Energy (WLCE) scenario that
   is operationally net-zero carbon. Depending on the FES, embodied carbon
   accounted between 59 and 80\% of total emissions compared to 20-41\%
   from operational carbon across design options. The results show that
   operational carbon is highly sensitive to the percentage of renewables
   in the energy mix of the grid, which is difficult to predict, and can
   significantly influence the design choice. As such, future researchers
   should account for predicted changes to the carbon intensity of the grid
   by applying a similar method to that proposed. Overall, the integration
   of IES VE and One Click LCA provided a more streamlined life cycle
   assessment to help inform early design decisions by enabling energy
   consumption simulation in BEM to assess operational carbon emissions and
   the automated transfer of building materials from the BEM model to the
   LCA tool to assess embodied carbon emissions. The limitations included
   the unavailability of material-specific data in early design stage
   plans, the inability to automatically transfer the timber frame
   structure from IES VE to One Click LCA, and the uncertainty of future
   energy trends.},

Title = {BIM and Automation in Complex Building Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {When using Building Information Modeling (BIM) for complex building
   design, optimizing the building quality in a design phase becomes an
   important part of integrated and advanced building design. The use of
   data from an information model in the design phase allows efficient
   assessment of different design strategies and structural variants and a
   higher quality of the final design. This paper aims to analyze and
   verify possible BIM data-driven workflows for Complex Building Quality
   Assessment (CBQA) and a suitable BIM data structure set up for automatic
   assessment and evaluation. For an efficient automation process in
   complex quality building assessment in the design phase, it is necessary
   first to understand the data structure of the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC), which is widely accepted and used for buildings, and
   second to understand the data structure of the assessment methodology
   used for the assessment. This article describes possible data workflows
   for an automatic assessment based on the experience gained on a case
   study of the real pilot project of a residential building, where the
   complex building quality was tested using SBToolCZ, the Czech national
   assessment method. This article presents the experience and
   recommendations for setting up the data model of a building for
   automatic assessment.},

Abstract = {The research described in this paper extends the use of building

   feasibility of capturing the construction process and related documents
   into a similar format. The research was conducted in parallel with
   traditional methods. The objectives of this project were to create a 3D
   as-built model, a four-dimensional as-built model, and attach the
   construction process information to the model for the owner to use after
   construction. A literature review indicates that BIM application stops
   at the preconstruction phase with a limited amount of research regarding
   data collection of the construction process. Significant contributions
   include practical 3D data collection methods and extending the BIM
   software products to accommodate construction process documentation.
   Results indicate that BIM software is not specifically prepared to
   accomplish these objectives and some modification to procedures as well

Title = {Appraising the Feasibility of 3D Printing Construction in New Zealand
   Housing},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The construction industry in New Zealand is significantly impacted by
   the importance of housing, particularly as urbanisation continues to
   grow in major cities. Modern construction methods, such as offsite
   construction and building automation, evolving into digital
   manufacturing and construction in the industry, have become prominent.
   Despite the global recognition of 3D printing technology, its adoption
   in the construction industry in New Zealand is still relatively limited.
   This study aims to examine the feasibility of 3D printing construction
   in response to current market challenges, innovation, and the 2050
   net-zero carbon goal. Utilising Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches, this study investigated the
   environmental impacts of three housing types: 3D printing (3DP), light
   steel framed (LSF), and timber. This study used cradle-to-cradle as the
   system boundary. The results indicate that the 3DP house emits 20\%
   fewer carbon emissions than the traditional timber house and 25\% less
   than the LSF house. Additionally, the 3DP house exhibits a 19\% lower
   annual electric energy consumption than the timber house. Therefore, in
   response to the growing housing demand in New Zealand, the construction
   industry must innovate and embrace digital and advanced construction
   methods, including the adoption of 3D printing.},

Title = {Mind the gap: Facilitating early design stage building life cycle
   assessment through a co-production approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {464},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Despite the transition towards a circular economy (CE) being a
   significant element in achieving the decarbonisation of the built
   environment, a clear and common pathway to applying CE principles to
   building design is still lacking in both industry practice and academia.
   The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) has the potential to enable the identification of
   feasible pathways to increase circularity. This study aims to
   investigate its practical use to facilitate the application of circular
   economy principles at the early stage of building design via using
   LCA-based BIM plugins. Within this aim, the paper centres on a co
   -production approach and presents a gap analysis by identifying gaps in
   knowledge and implementation as well as addressing the pressing needs of
   the current practice in the UK. A series of semi -structured interviews
   with expert practitioners in the field were conducted for data
   collection, contributing to the following phases of the co -production
   by allowing for an in-depth investigation and reflection of the
   practice. The findings have revealed that: (a) there is still an
   insufficient level of contextual awareness and readiness in the
   implementation of CE principles in the built environment and LCA
   understanding and (b) the adoption of BIM at the early stages of
   building design is still limited in the current practice; BIM models
   with sufficient level of data details and quality to enable circularity
   assessment are rarely produced. Thus, the paper highlights the need for
   enabling mechanisms, including the introduction of legislative
   instruments, the involvement and commitment of the industry and key
   stakeholders, the support for training and skills improvement, and the
   establishment of effective communication and implementation process
   management frameworks. Future research agenda points to the need of
   formulation of a BIM protocol to enable integration of BIM and LCA to
   promote CE principles in the building design process.},

Abstract = {Facility management platforms are widely used in the facility
   maintenance phase of the building life cycle. However, a large amount of
   complex building information affects facility managers' efficiency and
   user experience in retrieving specific information on the facility
   management platform. Therefore, this research aims to develop a
   conversation-based method to improve the efficiency and user experience
   of facility management information delivery. The proposed method
   contains four major modules: decision mechanism, equipment dataset,
   intent analysis, and knowledge base. A chatbot prototype was developed
   based on the proposed method. The prototype was then validated through a
   feasibility test and field test at the Shulin Arts Comprehensive
   Administration Building in Taiwan. The results showed that the proposed
   method changes the traditional information delivery between users and
   the facility management platform. By integrating natural language
   processing (NLP), building information modelling (BIM), and ontological
   techniques, the proposed method can increase the efficiency of FM

Abstract = {Investigating different design options constitutes an iterative process
   in the design phase of a building. Related decisions can heavily
   influence the further project course and realization. The steadily
   increasing introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in
   building design is replacing conventional methods currently dominating
   the life cycle management of buildings. In early design stages, the use
   of BIM offers promising advantages due to easily configurable models
   providing reusable information. To enable information exchange
   processes, the open data format Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) has
   been established. The scope of IFC, however, does not cover the
   management of design options. In this paper, an IFC-based management of
   design options is presented. By providing different options within one
   consistent model, the repeated creation of objects is avoided.
   Furthermore, the use of consistent identifiers is supported, preventing
   inconsistent data. To provide a transparent overview on the structure of
   the resulting model and the effect of single options, a graph-based
   representation is proposed.},

Abstract = {Prefabricated installation, a pivotal study in the realm of contemporary
   construction practices, delves into the utilization of prefabrication
   within mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. Despite its
   ascending prominence, the domain grapples with ambiguities in
   application pathways, uncertain developmental trajectories, and the
   absence of a holistic technical paradigm. This research endeavors to
   bridge these gaps by conducting a thorough and multidimensional
   investigation into the current landscape of prefabricated MEP
   installation initiatives. This study meticulously dissects the paradigm
   from five critical vantage points: historical evolution, standards and
   regulations, life cycle analysis, technological applications, and
   corporate implementation strategies. At present, there is still a lack
   of standards and specifications specifically for the field of assembled
   MEP installation. The analysis reveals a trend towards intelligent and
   sustainable installation practices in prefabricated MEP projects. The
   research predominantly focuses on the design, production, and
   installation stages. Notably, building information modeling (BIM)
   emerges as the most prominent technology, followed by the Internet of
   Things (IoT) and 3D laser scanning, with extended reality (XR)
   technologies gaining traction. Large, state-owned construction firms are
   spearheading innovative applications in this realm. In summary, this
   paper provides an overview and outlook for the development direction and
   the application of cutting-edge technologies in prefabricated MEP
   installation projects, with the aim of supporting the industry's
   advancement.},

Abstract = {A literature review was conducted regarding the use of technology
   applying structural health monitoring and maintenance allowing
   researchers to visualize and document results using BIM technology as a
   powerful tool, with the objective of estimating tools that are widely
   used in the architecture, engineering and construction sector through

Title = {BIM-driven optimization of life cycle cost in seismic design of urban
   buildings},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The predominant strategy in structural design is based on reducing the
   initial weight of the structure, while potential future costs due to,
   for instance, earthquake damage might be overlooked. This strategy means
   that no life cycle cost (LCC) assessment is performed over the design
   process. Yet, while many studies have addressed the LCC-based design of
   regular structures under earthquake loads, rare studies have applied it
   to irregular structures. Furthermore, the lack of utilization of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) capabilities in previous LCC-based
   design is evident. This study aims to highlight the impact of
   irregularity on optimizing the LCC of high-rise steel structures by
   providing an optimization framework for seismic design of regular and
   irregular structures integrating the capabilities of LCC and BIM. Using
   BIM, it is possible to significantly reduce the limitations of LCC
   analysis, such as time spent in data collection and exchange, and to
   increase the accuracy and speed of calculations. The framework here
   first combines results of different architectural and structural
   software through programming within MATLAB environment and then uses
   NSGA-II algorithm for establishing a trade-off between initial cost and
   LCC. To check the workability of the framework, six 3D tall steel
   structures, with 10-, 13-, and 20-floors, in two categories of regular
   and setback irregular are first designed for gravity and seismic loads
   and their performance using non-linear analyses are then analyzed. The
   results showed that the indirect costs of irregular structures were
   relatively higher than regular ones while higher initial cost needed to
   reduce LCC. For example, for both the 20-story regular and irregular
   structures, a 15\% increase in initial costs resulted in a 24 and 17\%
   reduction in their LCCs, respectively. Given that irregular structures
   are more susceptible to sustaining earthquake damage than regular ones,
   the proposed framework here can further provide the economic viability
   of irregular structures from an LCC-based perspective.},

Abstract = {Residential buildings consume approximately 36\% of total electricity
   consumption in Cyprus and this is expected to continue increasing in the
   coming years. This study explores the potential for energy savings in
   residential buildings in Cyprus through optimising building envelopes
   and insulation materials. Using building information modelling and
   energy modelling software, the study analyses 120 combinations of
   building envelopes and eight insulation materials, identifying an
   optimal combination of wall, roof, and flooring materials that could
   result in 32\% energy load reductions and 27\% lower life-cycle costs
   compared to the median scenario. High-density rock wool insulation on
   roofs and double-glazed windows were also found to offer both monetary
   and energy performance benefits. A sensitivity analysis revealed that
   the current high energy prices could provide greater economic incentives
   to adopt these optimisation strategies. Optimising building materials in
   Cyprus could play a critical role in climate strategy while also
   offering significant economic benefits.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {311-321},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Harvested rainwater is an alternative water source for buildings,
   especially for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing.
   While rainwater harvesting is perceived as a sustainable design
   approach, there is limited information on the environmental and economic
   performance of this technology. To address this literature gap, life
   cycle assessment and life cycle costing tools were applied for a
   dormitory that could potentially use harvested rainwater to flush
   toilets or to irrigate the lawn. Five scenarios were modeled including a
   new versus renovated building and irrigation versus toilet flushing
   water end use. The rainwater cisterns for all the scenarios were sized
   using the Yield After Spillage approach and long term daily
   precipitation of Toledo. Energy and greenhouse gas emissions were
   calculated using Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (for
   construction phase and energy use by pump) and GaBi (for water and
   wastewater treatment) databases. The life cycle environmental impacts
   and costs were estimated and compared to the business as usual scenario,
   where the water supply demands are met by municipally supplied potable
   water in a combined or separate sanitary sewer network. It was
   discovered that energy and greenhouse gas emission payback periods can
   be achieved for almost every scenario. Yet cost payback periods of
   implementing harvested rainwater were found to be longer than the life
   time of the building except for two scenarios: using rainwater for
   irrigation in a renovation project and using rainwater for toilet
   flushing in a new construction project. These two scenarios had the
   lowest cost, energy and greenhouse gas emission impacts among all
   scenarios modeled. Reducing occupancy to match toilet flushing demand
   increased the per person impact. However, in general, the per person
   impacts were much lower than a person's impact from driving or
   electricity use. While separate sewers divert the stormwater runoff to
   the water bodies and thereby prevent the environmental problems
   resulting from combined sewer overflows, a rainwater harvesting system
   connected to separate sewers was found to reduce the energy and
   greenhouse gas emissions less than so if the rainwater harvesting system
   were connected to combined sewers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Correction of collapse probability of bridges The concept of minimizing
   life cycle costs uses, among other things, the parameter of probability
   of failure. In contrast to all other parameters, however, a connection
   with observed collapse frequencies is denied in the literature. In this
   paper, factors for the correction of the calculated failure
   probabilities are presented based on the evaluation of collapse
   statistics. These factors consider e.g. the building material, the type
   of static system or the type of bridge. This information is usually

Abstract = {In order to facilitate some urban management tasks, information
   regarding buildings needs to be represented in form of geospatial
   information. Some tasks in urban management such as indoor navigation,
   emergency response management, and processes in the construction life
   cycle e.g., site selection can be facilitated through the use of certain
   and sometimes high amount of, geometric and semantic information about a
   building. A Building Information Model (BIM) can be defined as a
   semantically rich shared 3D digital building model. Recent research has
   demonstrated that geometric and semantic information from BIMs can be
   transferred into the geospatial environment and CAD/GIS/BIM information
   can be integrated at web services level. This paper presents a
   comparative opportunity analysis on the future role of BIMs in Urban
   Data Management. The analysis presented was focused on exploring, the
   impact of progression in Building Information Modeling research, to the
   opportunities provided by the use of BIMs in Urban Data Management

Title = {Integration of Building Information Modeling with Sport and Facility:
   Current Status and Future Directions},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Currently, sport is considered an entertainment and leisure industry and
   includes activities such as athletics, water, and skiing. The influence
   of a sport event exceeds the event itself, which indicates the
   importance of a sport facility to the building and construction. A sport
   facility refers to a facility related to the sport industry, mainly
   including not only stadiums, swimming pools, and sport centers, but also
   water parks, ski resorts, and other amusement facilities. At present,
   there is a lack of comprehensive exploration of integrated building
   information modeling (BIM) with sport and facilities and performance of
   applications to help identify potential opportunities to support
   sustainable development. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the
   integration of BIM, sport, and facility by revealing the current
   research status and hotspots in the field, which identifies the
   development lineage and emerging areas of the research and highlights
   the development trends and directions for future research towards
   sustainable development. This paper adopts a quantitative research
   method to investigate the current research status, hotspots, emerging
   areas, development trends, and important directions in the integration
   of BIM, sport, and facilities from macro-quantitative perspectives via
   bibliometric tools, i.e., VOSviewer and CiteSpace software packages. The
   main findings of this paper are that the hot keywords on the integration
   of BIM, sport, and facilities are mainly focused on BIM, facility
   management, framework, management, sport, construction, and design.
   Moreover, over the past 26 years (year 1997 to 2022), hot keywords for
   each year have been revealed through keyword co-occurrence overlay
   visualization analysis and identified in five schemes, i.e., life cycle
   assessment, emerging technology, behavior and sport, health and
   wellbeing, and sustainable built environment. Furthermore, the
   application of deep learning, IoT, and immersive experience technologies
   are current hot topics which could provide more innovative breakthroughs
   for the integration of BIM, sport, and facilities in the future for
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is a data-based tool for
   engineering, design, and building management, which is used to
   parameterize and model various types of information. This information
   may then be shared and introduced throughout the building life-cycle
   phases (planning, design, construction and operation, and maintenance
   (O\&M)). Therefore, BIM allows engineers to correctly understand and
   efficiently respond to varying types of building information as well as
   serves as a foundation for cooperation between the design and
   construction teams. Hence, BIM plays an important role in increasing
   productivity, minimizing costs, and shortening construction times. In
   this article, we present a case example where BIM was used for
   intelligent construction of a large wastewater-treatment plant (WTP).
   The process involved intelligent design and simulation techniques,
   management and simulation of construction works, digital delivery
   solutions, BIM-based Internet of things O\&M, and environmental
   monitoring. BIM was used to digitalize the construction, delivery, and
   O\&M processes of the WTP. According to this case example, we also offer
   suggestions on how deep learning and intelligent control techniques can
   be used to enhance intelligent O\&M in WTPs.},

Abstract = {Increasing attention was given to building information modeling (BIM)
   and multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) globally due to their
   advantages for various stages of the life cycle of a building. The aim
   of this paper is to improve practitioners? understanding of the process
   for BIM and MCDM adoption towards sustainable construction through
   energy efficiency. A questionnaire survey is being conducted for
   construction professionals and building industry experts in Malaysia.
   With expert survey data, a multi-criteria decision model using
   analytical network process (ANP) was built to identify key factors
   affecting sustainable building by reducing both embodied and operational
   energy and carbon emissions. Data from the survey was analysed using
   descriptive statistics. Model developed consisted of three clusters with
   a total of six nodes, and the level of importance was compared pairwise
   with one another. Results shows that design optimisation, reduced
   material requirements are important factors for sustainable construction
   considered in the BIM application. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Demolition waste represents a significant portion of the total generated
   waste and has a high importance from both a waste management and a
   resource efficiency perspective. The urban context is highly relevant to
   assess the environmental impact of the end-of-life stage of buildings
   and potential for future reduction to properly design corresponding
   demolition waste management strategies.
   The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the
   characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the
   potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of
   buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management
   strategies. The methodology combines a bottom-up material stock model
   based on geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial temporal
   database with life cycle assessment (LCA) for the evaluation of
   end-of-life scenarios.
   The approach was tested for the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg)
   and provided significant results on the quantity and the composition of
   the housing material stock. Two alternative scenarios involving
   recycling rates of respectively 50\% and 70\% for inert materials were
   assessed and an average reduction potential of 25.6\% on abiotic
   depletion potential and 9.2\% on global warming potential was estimated.

Title = {Comparative life cycle assessment of light frame timber and reinforced

   Luxembourg},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The building sector's significant greenhouse gas emissions and energy
   consumption present added challenges to meeting European climate
   commitments amidst rapid population growth. In Luxembourg, single-family
   houses dominate the residential buildings, noticeably contributing to
   construction waste and CO2 emissions. This study compares the
   environmental impacts of a threestory reinforced concrete masonry
   single-family house and an identical timber building in Luxembourg,
   emphasizing greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy. A cradle -to
   -grave life cycle assessment was conducted using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) models to analyze the global warming potential and
   primary energy requirements. Environmental product declarations from the
   producers and the center dot OKOBAUDAT German database were used to
   determine the environmental impacts of the materials. The results show
   that the timber building outperforms the concrete building with a 43.5\%
   lower global warming potential, while the concrete building demonstrates
   a 15.6\% reduction in primary energy demand. This aligns with the
   average outcomes of seven similar studies discussed in this paper, at
   33.2\% and 4.7\%, respectively. Moreover, the timber building is 78.6\%
   lighter than the concrete one. When evaluating benefits and loads beyond
   the system boundary, the timber building provides 3.6 and 4 times
   greater advantages in terms of global warming potential and primary
   energy, respectively, compared to the reinforced concrete masonry
   building. Additionally, the study explores the impact of reusing the
   floors in the timber building. The cradle -to -grave LCA reveals that
   reusing the timber slabs improves the building's global warming
   potential and primary energy by 2.4\% and 1.2\%, respectively. However,
   when considering the benefits and loads beyond the system boundary,
   floor system reuse exhibits a 38.9\% surge in global warming advantages
   while reducing primary energy benefits by 28.1\%. The findings advocate
   for a policy promoting timber construction and reuse in Luxembourg,
   aiming to achieve the net -zero emission target by 2050.},

Title = {Modular approach to multi-objective environmental optimization of
   buildings},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The application of heuristic algorithms with life cycle assessment (LCA)
   is a promising approach to efficiently optimize the building and
   minimize the environmental impact even in a very large design space. In
   this paper, a modular parametric optimization framework combining
   advanced building modelling, LCA, energy calculation and single- and
   multi-objective environmental optimization was developed and applied to
   a multi-apartment house in Hungary. The variables comprise geometry,
   envelope, fixtures, as well as the heating energy source. The objective
   is the life cycle environmental impact expressed in terms of the six
   most common LCA indicators. The results show that a relatively compact
   shape, large windows to south equipped with shading and very high levels
   of insulation are optimal from an environmental perspective. It was also
   proven that focusing only on the embodied or operational impact leads to
   a suboptimal solution, and the choice of the energy source for the
   operation of the building has a significant influence on the achievable
   optimum. Through the optimization, significant environmental savings of
   60-80\% were achieved compared to the initial design options showing the
   potential for the application of such methods in architectural design.},

Abstract = {The Malaysian construction industry will be revolutionised through the
   uptake of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as an information
   management tool in the project life cycle. The implementation would
   improve traditional working practices and change the working process
   through the promotion of a collaborative environment. However, the
   uptake of BIM in Malaysia is still at a low level. The reason for this
   lethargic adaptation could be due to the limited establishment of
   supporting reference documents at the national level that work as a
   guidance to describe how BIM should be adopted. Hitherto, many
   government construction authorities have established these various types
   of documents as initiatives to encourage the adoption of BIM coherently.
   This paper seeks to review the existing BIM documents established in
   Malaysia and Singapore. The review is carried out through the study of

Abstract = {This article focuses on developing an energy simulation model through
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Energy Modeling (BEM)to
   optimize energy in building design in Vietnam. Reducing the energy
   consumption in buildings will help reduce operating costs, impact the
   environment, and increase the efficiency of buildings. However, there is
   limited research on buildings with complex structures and
   configurations, detailed surface design, and envelope construction,
   especially in simulating details through BIM. The author proposes
   converting from BIM to BEM to simulate energy in buildings and optimize
   the factors related to building construction in the envelope design of
   the building. These factors include wall cladding materials, mirror
   materials, the window ratio on the walls, and other details. This study
   has effectively created an energy model for a public building, allowing
   for the calculation of the Energy Intensity Index (EUI) and annual
   energy costs for various scenarios. By altering factors associated with
   the design and construction process, the system has the potential to
   decrease both energy intensity and usage costs for the building. The
   study results will help designers and building managers improve and
   enhance energy efficiency in building projects.},

Abstract = {An efficient way to reduce the consumption of materials and energy in
   buildings is represented by an improvement of building processes. A
   regulated information management is essential to avoid delays, cost
   overrun, errors and lack of performances during the whole building
   life-cycle.
   Thus, the adoption of an integrated design process is becoming of great
   importance; BIM, considered as building information modelling and
   management, could be a way to perform such integrated processes.
   A central repository for project data and information could be
   advantageous if knowledge is exchanged between different stakeholders
   (e.g. through IFC or gbXML). Moreover, BIM supports building performance
   analyses and evaluations, allowing, for instance, simulation of energy
   performance, computation of environmental impacts and estimation of
   costs. In this way, it is possible to compare several options and choose
   the optimal ones.
   The importance of the link between BIM and sustainable buildings is
   underlined by the state of the art, such as the Green Overlay to the
   RIBA Outline Plan of Work, the series 10 of COBIM related to energy
   analysis, and the BIM Guide for energy performance developed by GSA.
   An Italian case study for the improvement of the building process is
   Innovance, a research project with the aim of developing a national
   database for the construction sector. In order to improve the
   collection, storing, management and sharing of data, an unambiguous
   classification system and standardized technical sheets have been
   developed and a web portal has been designed to ensure the interaction
   among stakeholders.},

Title = {Strategies for optimizing the environmental profile of dwellings in a
   Belgian context: A consequential versus an attributional approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {235-244},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {To date, many tools and guidelines to reduce environmental impacts from
   a life cycle perspective are available concerning the construction
   sector. However, basically all of them are modelled according to an
   attributional approach and there is a lack of studies that develop
   strategies for improvement based on a consequential LCA. The goal of
   this paper is to analyze to what extent the results differ when both
   models are applied on the same case, a representative dwelling located
   in Niel, Belgium. A conceptual optimization scenario for insulated
   exterior cladding has been added as well to examine to what extent
   different models affect the ranking of improvement strategies. For both
   approaches, the same foreground data and energy calculations are used,
   but the underlying structure of the models is different. The starting
   point is an attributional scenario, based on a Belgian guidance document
   `Environmental profile of building elements' (EPBE) published by the
   Public Waste Agency of Flanders. The results of the entire life cycle
   indicate differences between the approaches, in direct relationship to
   the underlying modelling assumptions. The discrepancy becomes more
   pronounced when looking at the separate materials so the effect is not
   damped as a consequence of the aggregation in life cycle phases.
   Especially the three most contributing materials (steel, concrete and
   brick) show clear differences. The optimization scenarios underline
   previous statement, since the ranking of the different solutions is not
   equal according to both approaches. This research points out the
   emergence of a discrepancy between results when different modelling
   approaches are applied. The consequential model that complements the
   attributional EPBE study is therefore a useful addition to provide
   information for decision-makers. This way, the right information is
   available for all type of decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In the last few years, several researches have added new dimensions to
   the usual 3D BIM approach, progressively including information about
   construction time (BIM 4D), costs estimation (BIM 5D) and life-cycle
   management (BIM 6D). Nevertheless, a key factor such as the building's
   interaction with its intended use and users is still under-represented
   by current BIM and IFC models: many users-related decisions are based on
   a set of average users requirements and on the assumption that, in this
   way, the future building will fulfil the needs of the majority of users.
   In this paper, we propose to include use' and users' semantics in
   current BIM representation, and to integrate it with the virtual
   simulation of the building use phenomenon. Its main objective is to
   provide a visualization of how the future building will actually be used
   and experienced, before stepping into its construction. This allows
   designers to test and evaluate the impact of their decisions on future
   users' life and activities in the proposed built environment during the
   design phases, when it is still possible to intervene and improve the
   quality of the final product by solving critical issues and reducing
   time and costs.

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40\% of the final energy use and one third
   of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. At the city scale, a quantitative
   assessment of the environmental impact of buildings is essential to
   support sustainable energy policies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has
   been widely used to assess building related environmental impacts;
   however, its extension to the urban scale is still hampered by several
   operational challenges. Coupling LCA and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) has been identified as a promising solution but developments are
   still needed.
   This paper presents an automated approach for the energy modelling and
   LCA of urban housing stocks based on GIS. The main steps of the approach
   are the following: (i) GIS-based building stock characterization; (ii)
   automated building-by-building energy analysis; (iii) Environmental
   impact calculation via LCA. The approach was applied to the test case
   city Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) to assess the potential environmental
   impact reduction driven by housing retrofitting.
   Results were provided building-by-building and displayed as maps for
   improved communication. An energy savings potential of 35.3\% and a
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) reduction of 30.8\% were calculated as
   results of retrofitting. The average contribution of the retrofitting
   stage on the residual life of the building stock is 4 to 10\% of the
   GWP, depending on the building type.
   The study provided one of the first models able to perform a
   fully-fledged LCA of buildings at the urban scale in a bottom-up
   fashion. The results are meant to support local authorities in setting
   priority strategies for environmental impact reduction.},

Abstract = {Building-related information is captured and has to be reused throughout
   the entire building life cycle. Therefore, an intuitively understandable
   and easy-to-handle access to a building life cycle wide archive is
   essential. Cross-disciplinary information seeking should be possible
   based on a three-dimensional representation of the building. In
   information seeking the planner must not be restricted to a single
   searching strategy. This paper initially focuses on all supporting
   explorative searching strategies. A ``raw{''} building information model
   schema has been enhanced by user-oriented associations between
   particular data objects, referred to in this paper as ``navigation
   links.{''} Each link is defined as a new property of a particular
   concept of the building model schema. Such a link points to a query
   recipe that can retrieve information about each instance of the concept.
   If the link is activated by a user, the query recipe is instantiated and
   processed by the system. The navigation links are formally represented
   using the Web Ontology Language. This paper describes the structure of
   the links as well as the structure of the system, which stores and
   processes the links throughout an information-seeking session.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM), is a collaborative methodology that
   gathers all the information of a project in a single virtual prototype,
   which can then be studied throughout its life cycle. One of the main
   difficulties in its use is the limited training of professionals in its
   use and scope. Consequently, this research proposes a real-time work
   procedure where, by using the BIM methodology in the initial stages of
   the design process, this constitutes a support system for
   decision-making with respect to Building Sustainability. With this in
   mind, basic guidelines are set out to develop a pilot classroom
   experience that integrates the use of the BIM methodology, by making a
   Building Energy Model (BEM) of three commonly used social housing
   prototypes in San Juan, Argentina. The result is the BIM Execution Plan
   (BEP) for the first use of the BIM methodology in the Vertical Workshop

Title = {A Two-Stage Building Information Modeling Based Building Design Method
   to Improve Lighting Environment and Increase Energy Efficiency},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world, and have
   great energy saving potential. Thermal systems and lighting systems take
   most of the energy in a building. Comparing with the optimization
   solutions developed for a thermal system, the research of improving the
   lighting system is insufficient. This study aims to improve the lighting
   environment and reduce the energy by optimizing the building design,
   which has the largest potential for cutting energy economically compared
   with the other stages in the life cycle of a building. Although many
   approaches have been developed for building design optimization, there
   is still one big problem obstructing their successful practices, in that
   the designers who take the responsibility of making building designs are
   not experts in building physics, thus they are not capable of
   calculating the most appropriate parameters and operating the
   professional software to optimize their designs. Therefore, this study
   proposes a user-friendly method for designers to improve building
   designs. Firstly, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and particle swarm
   optimization algorithm are applied to build an intelligent optimal
   design search system. The optimized design from this system can largely
   use daylighting for internal illumination and save energy. Secondly,
   different types of lighting control systems are compared and the one
   which can save maximal energy is added to the selected optimal design. A
   case study demonstrates that optimized designs generated by the proposed
   design method can save large amounts of life cycle energy and costs, and
   is effective and efficient.},

Title = {A novel BIM-based process workflow for building retrofit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has developed policies aimed at accelerating the
   retrofit of existing buildings, with the vision of a decarbonised
   building stock by 2050. Retrofitting of existing buildings offers
   significant opportunities to reduce global energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions. Although there is a wide range of government
   incentives available, retrofits only affect 0.5-1\% of the building
   stock per year. Thus, this research conducted a literature review in
   order to identify the barriers preventing retrofitting of existing
   buildings. These barriers include low financial availability, user
   awareness, uncertainty in regulatory frameworks and fragmentation of the
   supply chain. The research presented here overcomes these retrofit
   barriers by developing a novel step-by-step guideline for building
   retrofit. The proposed workflow combines the benefits of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) with the Business Process Modelling (BPM)
   technique. BIM is used for its capacity to create and manage information
   along the full life-cycle of a building. While BPM allows to optimise
   the retrofit workflow, by providing all relevant stakeholders with (i)
   the instruments to better understand their roles and responsibilities in
   the retrofit process, (ii) the technological framework and data needed
   to efficiently implement BIM within the project. This novel BIM-BPM
   workflow was demonstrated on a residential pilot building located in
   Inis M ` or, Ireland.},

Title = {Integrating Digital Twin and Blockchain for dynamic building Life Cycle
   Sustainability Assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology offers a
   promising solution to achieve a sustainable built environment by
   simultaneously considering all sustainability pillars. However,
   traditional LCSA applications are typically confined to the early design
   stages of building projects, where they assess the entire life cycle of
   a building using static historical data rather than being employed as a
   decision-making tool throughout all project phases with real-time data
   integration. This research addresses these limitations by investigating
   the integration of LCSA with Digital Twin (DT) and Blockchain
   technologies to enhance sustainability assessments in building projects.
   The primary aim is to develop a dynamic framework that incorporates
   realtime data across a building's entire life cycle. This study utilizes
   a systematic literature review to identify current trends and gaps,
   leading to the development of an integrative framework validated through
   a case study of a typical residential building. The findings demonstrate
   that integrating DT facilitates continuous monitoring and assessment of
   environmental, economic, and social impacts, while Blockchain ensures
   data security, integrity, and transparency. This novel approach supports
   real-time, iterative LCSA applications, enhancing decision-making from
   design through construction and maintenance. By showcasing a practical
   application of DT and Blockchain in real-world scenarios, this framework
   significantly advances sustainable practices in construction. The
   originality of this research lies in its holistic approach, combining DT
   and Blockchain to deliver a more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive
   sustainability assessment model, setting a new standard for future
   developments in the field.},

Title = {Seismic resilience assessment of coastal carbon and weathering steel
   moment frame considering uniform atmospheric corrosion effects},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Carbon steel (CS) has been extensively used in the construction of steel
   moment frame buildings in coastal, industrial, and rural regions.
   However, its performance under multi-hazards, such as the combined
   atmospheric corrosion and earthquake loads, has been largely overlooked.
   In contrast, weathering steel (WS) has received less attention as an
   alternative material to increase the life cycle resilience due to
   corrosion. This work aims to fill this research void by investigating
   the seismic resilience of building structures constructed with CS and WS
   materials. To achieve this goal, a probabilistic seismic resilience
   assessment of three different models called non-corroded steel frame
   (NCSF), corroded carbon steel frame (CCSF), and corroded weathering
   steel frame (CWSF) is performed through the incremental dynamic analysis
   (IDA). The findings indicate a significant reduction in the seismic
   resilience of CCSF with an increase of the life cycle cost compared to
   NCSF. In contrast, CWSF experienced an increase in resilience and a
   decrease in the life cycle cost compared to CCSF. These results
   underscore the critical need for regular maintenance and corrosion
   mitigation strategies in CS structures, particularly in areas prone to
   high humidity and seismic activity. This study contributes to a broader
   understanding of the interplay between the environmental degradation and
   structural safety, providing a valuable, insightful information for the

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recently, the application of the BIM technique to infrastructure
   lifecycle management has increased rapidly to improve the efficiency of
   infrastructure management systems. Research on the lifecycle management
   of infrastructure, from planning and design to construction and
   management, has been carried out. Therefore, a systematic review of the
   literature on recent research is performed to analyze the current state
   of the BIM technique. State-of-the-art techniques for infrastructure
   lifecycle management, such as unmanned robots, sensors and processing
   techniques, artificial intelligence, etc., are also reviewed. An
   infrastructure BIM platform framework composed of BIM and
   state-of-the-art techniques is then proposed. The proposed platform is a
   web-based platform that contains quantity, schedule (4D), and cost (5D)
   construction management, and the monitoring systems enable collaboration
   with stakeholders in a Common Data Environment (CDE). The lifecycle
   management methodology, after infrastructure construction, is then
   completed and is developed using state-of-the-art techniques using
   unmanned robots, scan-to-BIM, and deep learning networks, etc. It is
   confirmed that collaboration with stakeholders in the CDE in
   construction management is possible using an infrastructure BIM
   platform. Moreover, lifecycle management of infrastructure is possible
   by systematic management, such as time history analysis, damage growth
   prediction, decision of repair and demolition, etc., using a regular
   inspection database based on an infrastructure BIM platform.},

Title = {BIM competencies for delivering waste-efficient building projects in a
   circular economy},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Competency measures are increasingly becoming effective ways for
   construction organizations to measure their ability to deliver
   waste-efficient projects. Despite the ongoing efforts in achieving the
   goals of the circular economy through BIM adoption, there is still a
   paucity of studies on building information modeling (BIM) competencies
   for delivering waste-efficient building projects. This paper, therefore,
   aims to identify and investigate critical BIM competencies for
   delivering waste-efficient building projects in a circular economy. The
   study adopts a pluralistic approach, using a combination of the review
   of extant literature, focus group discussions and questionnaire survey.
   Analysis of the focus group discussion along with the result of the
   literature review revealed forty-three preliminary BIM competencies,
   which were subjected to rigorous statistical analyses. Four broad
   categories of BIM competencies for delivering waste-efficient building
   projects emerged from the analyses. These are project
   management-related, construction-related, procurement-related, and
   design-related BIM competencies. Construction firms could use the BIM
   competencies identified in this study to enhance the delivery of
   waste-efficient building projects as well as assess their BIM competency
   requirements at an individual and organizational level.},

Abstract = {The engineering design process has fundamentally impacted the life cycle
   of construction projects and notably, the engineering performance is
   significantly measured in delivering projects. Previous studies on
   engineering performance have established the cause-effect relationships
   between project variables and performance measures. Recently, the
   building information modeling (BIM) application has reformed how owners
   execute the engineering, construction, commissioning, and operation in
   the industry. There has been an increasing focus in finding the benefits
   of BIM on project performance, however, a minor focus has been given to
   engineering performance. This paper proposes an artificial neural
   network (ANN) machine learning multilayer perceptron (MLMP) method and
   linear regression (LR) that correlates the use of BIM with engineering
   performance for better construction project assessment. The conclusions
   reveal a high-level correlation measure between BIM use inputs and
   engineering performance outputs and further methods for evaluating the
   engineering performance. Furthermore, we achieved and validated the best
   prediction by leveraging data from 60 samples using the MLMP and LR
   models.},

Title = {A holistic review on life cycle energy of buildings: An analysis from
   2009 to 2019},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Energy consumption of buildings is at the forefront of the total energy
   consumption list, and its environmental impact is increasing, thus
   making construction industry as a key player in energy. A systematic and
   comprehensive life cycle perspective assessment of building energy is
   crucial for maintaining project sustainability. Building energy analysis
   from life cycle perspective has been increasingly favoured by scholars.
   However, the links and contents of many literatures have not been
   summarized and lacking systematic literature research. This review-based
   research used a holistic analysis approach as the framework.
   Bibliometrics method in the first stage was used to select 255 papers
   published during 2009-2019 related to life cycle energy of buildings
   (LCE-B). Scientometric analysis in the second stage was adopted for
   identifying the journal sources, scholars, regions and articles that
   have been fruitful and influential in LCE-B research, and keywords
   analysis was proposed to preliminarily explore the research topics in
   the domain (e.g. analysis of optimisation). Results showed that BIM and
   multi-objective optimisation have become research hotspots recently. An
   in-depth qualitative discussion in the last stage was conducted to
   achieve three main objectives: (1) summarise mainstream research topics
   (e.g. calculation and parameter determination of embodied energy); (2)
   discuss existing research gaps (e.g. the spatial heterogeneity of
   embodied energy); and (3) identify future research directions. This
   study provides a comprehensive knowledge framework combined with
   philosophical theories that links current research fields with future
   research trends, providing researchers with multi-disciplinary guidance
   to gain insight into the latest research on LCE-B.},

Abstract = {Construction organizations have increasingly realized the importance of
   knowledge management (KM). They have also increasingly applied various
   tools and strategies to manage their knowledge. Due to the temporary
   nature of construction projects, however, there continues to be certain
   barriers and challenges of KM that are hard to overcome. This article
   explores the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) to achieve
   better KM in UK construction organizations. First of all, why and how
   BIM can facilitate KM in construction projects are identified from the
   literature review. Secondly, a questionnaire survey in quantitative
   measurement is used to investigate key aspects of KM that can be
   improved by using BIM. The results of quantitative data analysis are
   further discussed with the help of literature review. It is found in
   this article that BIM has the potential to support KM in construction
   projects. In particular, BIM contributes to proactive KM, lifecycle KM,
   and KM processes. The findings of this article provide researchers and
   practitioners with a better understanding of BIM-based KM.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a pivotal role in the
   digitization of facilities management (FM), fundamentally transforming
   the built environment sector. However, managing the change in
   organizations to successfully transition into a BIM-enabled FM system
   remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper starts with
   a literature review of existing theories and practices of change
   management and digital transformation in the built environment sector.
   Based on the analysis of barriers and strategies identified in the
   literature review, a five-step roadmap for change management in BIM
   adoption is proposed. It includes establishing a change management team,
   conceptualizing the initiative, developing an implementation plan,
   managing the transition phase, and maintaining the change. The roadmap
   aims to guide organizations to effectively adopt BIM for FM, resulting
   in streamlined transition, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved
   asset performance. Further research is needed to validate the proposed
   roadmap and its potential for generalization to other sectors and
   countries.},

Abstract = {The HOLISTEEC project aims at designing, developing, and demonstrating a
   BIM-based, on-the-cloud, collaborative building design software
   platform, featuring advanced design support for multicriteria building
   optimization. In the framework of HOLISTEEC project, the first step
   towards the optimization of the overall building design process is put
   forward in this paper and corresponds to the definition of a ``full
   life-cycle aware{''} novel design methodology. This methodology, after
   being properly validated, will constitute the basis for the
   implementation of a BIM infrastructure suitable for the development of
   dedicated design evaluation tools (i.e. architectural, structural,
   acoustic, energy, lighting and environmental calculation engines),
   providing grounded feedback to the design and a multi-criteria decision
   tool for selecting the optimal design solution.},

Title = {Climate Mitigation in the Swedish Single-Family Homes Industry and
   Potentials for LCA as Decision Support},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Decision support tools for incentivizing environmentally sound decisions
   in building design, such as LCA (life cycle assessment), have been
   highlighted as an essential feature for enhancing the realization of
   more sustainable buildings. Nevertheless, the use of LCA to support
   decisions in building design is still limited in practice. A better
   understanding of the social dynamics and detailed contexts of the
   decisions leading up to a final building design is therefore critical
   for better integration of LCA-based information in the decision-making
   processes. This paper reports a qualitative, semi-structured interview
   study of single-family home producers in Sweden and their
   decision-making in relation to climate mitigation, with a particular
   focus on embodied carbon mitigation. By studying a specific branch of
   the building and construction sector, a more in-depth record can be
   obtained of the particularities of implementation contexts and
   decision-making situations in which LCA may, or may not, have a role in
   driving climate mitigation. Four primary decision contexts in which LCA
   may have an influential role to drive embodied carbon reduction include:
   (1) the development of building systems, (2) development and offering of
   house models, (3) the selection of construction products for the
   building system as well as for the offer of add-on products to
   customers, and (4) the dialogues in the individual house-buyer projects.
   Decision-making that affects sustainable outcomes in this part of the
   sector is very much dependent on a supporting regulatory context. Over
   the years, using building LCA in early design stages, for optimization
   towards low-impact final buildings, has been a repeatedly promoted
   recommendation both in academia and practice. This study, however,
   reveals that such a conclusion is too simplistic. The different
   overarching decision contexts identified for this particular branch
   display the variety of needs for life cycle-based information.},

Abstract = {The buildings' sector accounts for a large share of energy consumption
   on a global scale. This scenario generates the need to design and
   construct more efficient buildings and also requires new policies and
   incentives. The greatest opportunities for integrating energy efficiency
   strategies in construction occur at the design stage, in which decisions
   that will have significant impacts on the building's life cycle are
   taken. Therefore, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   considered, as well as parametric design: new design technologies that
   allow the analysis of multiple scenarios to support the decisions during
   the design stage. The purpose of this study is to provide, through a
   literature analysis, an overview about practical applications of BIM and
   parametric design for buildings' energy efficiency in a recent research
   scenario. Studies were categorized according to their main approach and
   the main software used. In addition, benefits provided by the use of the
   technologies adopted were highlighted.},

Title = {BIM Information Standard Framework for Model Integration and Utilization
   Based on openBIM},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming more common
   in the construction process, and the demand for the integrated use of
   BIM data is expected to continue increasing. BIM is a technology that
   can maximize various efficiencies by sharing facility information in an
   integrated manner; however, the information generated in the life cycle
   of the construction industry is broad, diverse, and complex.
   Accordingly, because BIM information is difficult to share and is often
   duplicated, it is not easy to obtain the effects of various BIMs. The
   solution to this is to create a systematic standard so that one item of
   information can be used in various ways, and everyone shares and uses it
   together. To this end, various standards (guides, classification
   systems, information standards, etc.) are being created; however, the
   interrelationships between standard elements are complex, so there is
   confusion and overlap between standards. This paper proposes an
   information standard framework for BIM to identify a systematic standard
   and method to effectively develop various guidelines for the standard.},

Abstract = {BIM models are seldom used for the energy certification of buildings.
   This paper discusses the advantages of linking two important fields:
   building information modeling (BIM) and building environmental
   assessment methods (BEAM), presented as a rating system and a proposal
   for the Chilean context. The state of the art in both fields around the
   world is discussed, with an in-depth examination of current BIM software
   and related applications, followed by a discussion about previous
   research on integrating them. A lack of interoperability and data losses
   between BIM and BEM were found. A new tool is presented that addresses
   these challenges to ensure accurate rating system data, and this new
   framework is based on database exchange and takes crucial information
   from BIM to BEAM platforms. The development of the method includes BIM
   programming (API), database links, and spreadsheets for a Chilean
   building energy certification through a new tool, also applicable to
   multiclimactic zones. This new semi-automatic tool allows architects to
   model their design in a BIM platform and use this information as input
   for the energy certification process. The potential and risks of this
   method are discussed. Several improvements and enhancements of the
   energy certification process were found when incorporating this new
   framework in comparison to current methodologies.},

Abstract = {Theoretical developments in Building Information Modelling (BM) suggest
   that not only is it useful for geometric modelling of a building's

   construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to explore the
   extent to which the use of BIM has resulted in reported benefits on a
   cross-section of construction projects. This exploration is done by
   collecting secondary data from 35 construction projects that utilised
   BIM. A set of project success criteria were generated and content
   analysis was used to establish the extent to which each individual
   project met a criterion. The most frequently reported benefit related to
   the cost reduction and control through the project life cycle.
   Significant time savings were also reported. Negative benefits were
   mainly focused on the use of BIM software. Cost/benefit analysis,
   awareness raising and education and training are important activities to
   address the challenges of BIM usage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. APM and

   into a building life-cycle management system requires the creation of
   both a knowledge management and knowledge management system and a time
   management system. Learning creates knowledge and ``knowledge
   organization{''} is an organization that uses knowledge to develop and
   achieve (long-term) goals. In general, there is no guaranteed procedure,
   no universal set of tools to help build a knowledge-based organization.
   If knowledge creation is to be used to better achieve results, it should
   not be separated from other activities of the organization. Knowledge
   Management represents the establishment and subsequent managing special
   network structure that includes all existing knowledge units. Knowledge
   management is often perceived as a survivor of the company today, but
   managers often do not realize that it is a much more complex process
   than generating large tables in Excel for comprehensive reporting to
   senior management and owners. Well-organized Knowledge Management can
   create concepts of knowledge, review and consolidate them, prepare
   action plans to create, secure, combine and coordinate knowledge, as
   well as set up clear ways to extract them from knowledge bases at the
   time of need and hunger for quality.},

Title = {Introducing environmental decision-making criteria to foster Green

Abstract = {Governments in the Global South have recently started to align their
   public procurement regulations considering Green Public Procurement
   (GPP) guidelines to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 12. In this
   context, it is important to establish environmental criteria to help
   decision making after analyzing the variety of options available in the
   market. Thus, using as examples two of the most acquired products in
   public procurement in Peru: Medium-density particleboard melamine
   furniture and paper offset, the aim of this paper is to determine the
   main environmental hotspots and therefore show the path to foster GPP in
   Peru. To achieve this goal, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried out
   considering it is a suitable environmental management tool to quantify
   environmental impacts. For this, a set of scenarios were modeled and
   compared for each of the two products selected, covering different
   geographical and technological options that are currently purchased by
   the Peruvian government. Results demonstrated that it is possible to
   attain considerable reductions in the environmental impact of the
   products analyzed if the main critical stages throughout their life
   cycle are identified and adequate solutions are applied to avoid burden
   shifting. Moreover, we argue that it is important for developing
   countries to carry out case-specific life-cycle inventories as they
   provide higher-quality information based on the particular
   characteristics of regional or local industries, allowing the
   determination of more realistic environmental impact mitigation
   benchmarks. Nevertheless, the inclusion of lifecycle-based criteria in
   GPP must be performed cautiously, avoiding command and control
   regulations, as numerous challenges remain in terms of capacity
   building, environmental awareness, and environmental information, and
   transparency in emerging and developing economies. Integr Environ Assess

   interview with the Indian additive manufacturing experts from the
   Southern and northern region of India. The study was conducted on email
   interviews, in-depth phone calls and a multiple-choice questionnaire
   survey circulated through emails. The interviewees represented the
   different stakeholders in the Indian additive manufacturing industries
   with varying knowledge of life cycle assessment including the additive
   manufacturing product manufacturers, consultants for AM industries,
   research institutes and academia. The experts suggested that there is a
   need for good understanding the different factors in additive
   manufacturing industries which will help them to lower their carbon
   emissions and conduct the LCA in the industries with proper LCA tools
   and databases available for additive manufacturing industries. This
   study will be helpful for the researchers and R\&D in industries to
   provide insights that how Indian additive manufacturing industries
   experience the use of life cycle assessment. In the study, several
   awareness issues are addressed which will be beneficial for Indian
   additive manufacturing industries to expand and accelerate the life

Abstract = {The overall aim of this study is to develop a Building Information
   Modelling based Deconstructability Assessment Score (BIM-DAS) for
   determining the extent to which a building could be deconstructed right
   from the design stage. To achieve this, a review of extant literature
   was carried out to identify critical design principles influencing
   effectual building deconstruction and key features for assessing the
   performance of Design for Deconstruction (DfD). Thereafter, these key
   features were used to develop BIM-DAS using mathematical modelling
   approach based on efficient material requirement planning. BIM-DAS was
   later tested using case study design and the results show that the major
   contributing factors to DID are use of prefabricated assemblies and
   demountable connections. The results of the evaluation demonstrate the
   practicality of BIM-DAS as an indicator to measure the
   deconstructability of building designs. This could provide a design
   requirement benchmark for effective building deconstruction. This
   research work will benefit all stakeholders in the construction industry
   especially those interested in designing for deconstruction. The
   eventual incorporation of BIM-DAS into existing BIM software will
   provide a basis for the comparison of deconstructability of building
   models during design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   the Integration Methods between BIM and LEED},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the context of sustainable development and parametric design, it is
   interesting to analyze the possible synergies between Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the most-used certification
   scheme for the design, construction, and management of green buildings,
   and Building Information Modeling (BIM), which supports the supply,
   integration, and management of information throughout the building life
   cycle. This paper aims to review the state of the art of the different
   integration methods between LEED and BIM at the early design phase.
   Third-party software information exchange, the cloud-BIM approach, and
   plug-in development using application program interface (API) were
   considered as possible integration strategies to automate LEED
   certification by BIM. In addition, optimization models and rule-based
   methods were analyzed. Finally, a critical review on the limitations,
   advantages and future research developments in LEED and BIM integration
   was clearly defined. Although the development of plug-ins was the most
   powerful integration method, it requires advanced informatics knowledge.
   On the other hand, using third-party tools increased manual working and
   checking due to interoperability issues. A visual programming language
   (VPL) can allow designers and researchers without any informatics
   knowledge to create parametric BIM models by including LEED
   requirements.},

Title = {Life cycle embodied energy analysis of higher education buildings: A
   comparison between different LCI methodologies},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nearly half of the global annual energy supply is consumed by the
   building construction sector, indicating an enormous potential to
   minimize the carbon footprint. During its life cycle, a building
   consumes energy in the form of embodied and operational energy. Embodied
   energy (EE) is expended in processes during construction (ex: extraction
   of raw material, transportation, manufacturing, etc.). Operating energy
   (OE) is spent on operating and maintaining the building to ensure
   occupant comfort. Unlike OE, the methods used to calculate EE are
   complex, unstandardized, and time-consuming. Each EE calculation method
   utilizes different sources of data and system boundary definitions,
   therefore making it difficult to comprehensively evaluate building life
   cycle energy (LCE). Literature suggests that the disaggregated
   input-output based hybrid (IOH) approach is more accurate, complete, and
   reliable in comparison to the other EE calculation methods. In this
   study, we examine the EE-OE relationship by calculating EE factors for a
   newly constructed and renovated educational building. Next, we also
   compare the variation in EE factors across different life cycle
   inventory (LCI) methods (process-based, aggregated IOH, and
   disaggregated IOH). The results of this study indicate that using
   different LCI techniques to calculate EE causes massive variations in EE
   factors, which represent the EE expense of saving one unit of OE. The
   findings of our study and literature review show that the process-based
   approach underestimates EE, therefore the values of EE factors
   calculated using this approach need to be interpreted with caution.
   These results further elucidate the importance of standardizing the EE
   calculation method.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a revolutionary stride of
   technology in the orthodox construction and procedures in conventional
   Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry which is
   stressed upon for its delay on embracing new technologies. The strength
   of BIM has been disvalued in the eyes of many professionals, to think of
   BIM as just another `software' which is in reality, a `process' of
   attaining an outstanding collaboration among each and every stakeholder
   throughout a project's life cycle. Hence, the philosophy of Supply Chain
   Management (SCM) in a construction project can be achieved effectively
   with the BIM's promise of flexible and transparent interaction among
   Construction Supply Chain (CSC) contributors. However, the complexities
   in CSC of a conservative setup has been more composite with the
   intervention of BIM. Consequently, the BIM project stakeholders have
   encountered complications on the effective application of BIM on CSC
   while reaching the envisioned goals of BIM. Thus, the intention of this
   study is to develop a foreseeable information flow model related to
   construction supply chain in a BIM aided project. In order to attain the
   aim, an extensive literature synthesis was piloted to develop a
   conceptual informational flow model among CSC stakeholders of a BIM
   project. This contemporary research outlines that the CSC of a BIM
   project is much interactive and flexible with its collaborative effort
   of stakeholders when compared to the clashes among professionals in
   traditional setups. In a practical context, the roles and duties of BIM
   project stakeholders identified in BIM standards, have slightly differed
   due to real-world complications in construction industry. Besides that,
   BIM standards have laid down charismatic arrangements on information
   flows among BIM project stakeholders, which is in reality, a complex and
   random setup. Hence, the research outcome has successfully answered the
   complications by laying down guidelines for any outsider to the BIM
   field to recognise what would be the contribution of each stakeholder
   throughout the BIM project's life cycle.},

Title = {Using systematic building decomposition for implementing LCA: The

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {The building Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applied to buildings requires
   collecting and organizing large quantities of data over all building
   life cycles. To overcome specific difficulties related to the system
   boundaries definition and life cycle inventory stages, the literature
   recognizes that systematic building decomposition methods (SBDM) can be
   used to classify building components, elements and materials, as well as
   to increase the reliability and transparency of LCA results,
   particularly for embodied carbon and other environmental impacts. In
   this paper developed in the context of the research project IEA EBC
   Annex 72, the authors aim to provide a basis for un-derstanding how
   different SBDMs decompose a building and classify its parts. This study
   analyses the implica-tions of using different SBDM along the steps of an
   LCA study. Such as to support transparent and comprehensible
   (de)composition of the life cycle inventory (LCI), definition of service
   lives for different building parts or clear and comparable communication
   of assessment results and environmental hotspots particularly when using
   digital tools to conduct LCA. The study analyses 12 national SBDMs used
   in participating countries of IEA EBC Annex 72. To showcase the
   implications of SBDMs in building LCA practice, an office building was
   used as a common case study for applying the different SBDM approaches.
   Differences were identified among the decomposition levels and the
   consequences of these differences on the LCI organization. Thus, some of
   the main contributions to this study are the investigation of different
   SBDM approaches for improving the design work-flows, by discussing BIM
   model definitions and the recommendation to use hierarchically based
   methods to allow the building elements and materials decomposition.},

Abstract = {Residential building inspections are periodically required by public
   authorities. However, current approaches to storing and viewing data
   concerning an inspection are often collected in reports whose form and
   limited content hamper the rigorous assessment of the building's state
   of conservation and subsequent repair of the identified damage and
   alterations. This research proposes a method for documenting and
   displaying inspection-related information in BIM models to generate a
   dynamic information model. Damage is spatially located by means of a
   parametric family, which collects the necessary information about each
   instance of damage and enables agile and up-to-date information
   extraction. The proposed method was validated in a residential building
   situated in San Sebastian, with a scenario designed to demonstrate its
   ability to support the diagnosis of causes and decision making regarding
   maintenance. This work demonstrates the advantages of the parametric
   representation of information on damage and alterations in a BIM model,
   which facilitates the management of a residential building's life cycle
   by means of a digital twin of the building. The results shown in this
   research may be very interesting for researchers as well as for those
   whose work involves the rehabilitation of residential buildings.},

Abstract = {Previous research indicates that Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   serves as a digital platform for integrating pertinent data across all
   stages of construction, enhancing data management capabilities. This is
   notably crucial during initial investment planning and throughout

   management, practice, quality assurance, and cost control concurrently.
   BIM contributes novel insights into green building development while
   posing significant challenges. The complexity of optimizing multiple
   performance indicators using BIM has hindered its widespread adoption in
   design practice, confining its application primarily to academic
   research. Therefore, this paper reviewed 168 previous studies from the
   past ten years, conducted an in-depth review and comparison, and
   provides suggestions for possible future research direction for BIM
   research. Specifically, the paper systematically reviews the application
   of BIM in design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofit and
   demolition, and all the assessment phases of green buildings, and
   discusses the advantages of the BIM application in green buildings as
   well as an analysis of the current research gaps. This research enhances
   practitioners' understanding of BIM and green buildings' current trends

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming a comprehensive
   collaborative process in the construction industry. Despite its short
   history, BIM has had an increasing growth during the last decade. This
   is happening mainly due to its capabilities on construction projects.
   BIM can create a common language between all parties and system
   divisions in a project and make them an integrated team. The approach of
   BIM strongly matches with integrated project delivery systems. The role
   of BIM as a coordinator of project system is quite similar to the duties
   of a project manager. BIM integrates different disciplines by effective
   communication, analyzes the project systems for constructability,
   estimates the cost and time of projects at any time using quantity
   takeoffs, draws a big picture of projects using visualization and builds
   collaborative teams. All these are what a project manager does in a
   different scale during a project life cycle.
   This paper aims to show the correspondence of BIM and project managers'
   roles on construction projects. It emphasizes the importance of having
   proper BIM knowledge and experience for project managers to succeed.
   This paper also discusses the requirements of BIM knowledge and
   experience enrichment of project managers.},

Title = {Structural Optimization of Trusses in Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) Projects Using Visual Programming, Evolutionary Algorithms, and
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tools},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The optimal structural design is imperative in order to minimize
   material consumption and reduce the environmental impacts of
   construction. Given the complexity in the formulation of structural
   design problems, the process of optimization is commonly performed using
   artificial intelligence (AI) global optimization, such as the genetic
   algorithm (GA). However, the integration of AI-based optimization,
   together with visual programming (VP), in building information modeling
   (BIM) projects warrants further investigation. This study proposes a
   workflow by combining structure analysis, VP, BIM, and GA to optimize
   trusses. The methodology encompasses several steps, including the
   following: (i) generation of parametric trusses in Dynamo VP; (ii)
   performing finite element modeling (FEM) using Robot Structural Analysis
   (RSA); (iii) retrieving and evaluating the FEM results interchangeably
   between Dynamo and RSA; (iv) finding the best solution using GA; and (v)
   importing the optimized model into Revit, enabling the user to perform
   simulations and engineering analysis, such as life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and quantity surveying. This methodology provides a new
   interoperable framework with minimal interference with existing
   supply-chain processes, and it will be flexible to technology literacy
   and allow architectural, engineering and construction (AEC)
   professionals to employ VP, global optimization, and FEM in BIM-based
   projects by leveraging open-sourced software and tools, together with
   commonly used design software. The feasibility of the proposed workflow
   was tested on benchmark problems and compared with the open literature.
   The outcomes of this study offer insight into the opportunities and
   limitations of combining VP, GA, FEA, and BIM for structural
   optimization applications, particularly to enhance structural efficiency
   and sustainability in construction. Despite the success of this study in
   developing a workable, user-friendly, and interoperable framework for
   the utilization of VP, GA, FEM, and BIM for structural optimization, the

Abstract = {In a globalized production environment companies are confronted with
   shortening product life cycles leading to shortening factory system life
   cycles. To overcome this issue, factories have to be (re-)built faster.
   The design time is a crucial phase in which many different disciplines
   of different domains have to work together in a major planning project.
   Currently, various experts in the respective domains of e.g. production
   system planning, automation and building are commonly working on their
   silo models resulting in different and sometimes contradictory
   information depending on the perspective of planning. While
   model-orientated, collaborative planning approaches like Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) have become familiar with the domain of
   factory planning, there is still a lack of combining the different
   factory data models holistically to connect all elements of production
   regarding information of products, processes and resources. Besides the
   BIM methodology several other forms of virtual factory descriptions,
   like the digital factory twin have emerged. In this work, a systematic
   literature review is conducted to present the current perspective on
   creating factory data models about a cross-domain usage and modeling
   approach. In analyzing the current use case definition of factory models
   the opportunity is seen to point out the importance of the combination
   of holistically linked factory data models with a multipurpose design.
   In doing so, a possibility is seen to overcome the mentioned obstacles
   of planning while raising the value of the created models. This
   demonstrates the need for a concept of modeling a digital factory twin,
   created for cross-domain usage.},

Abstract = {Construction is a crucial sector in terms of worldwide environmental
   impacts. Building material production along with transport and
   demolition are no exception, because in the last decades, they have
   constantly increased their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Actions and
   initiatives are therefore important to tackle the relationship between
   buildings and climate change. Particularly, it is necessary to develop
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools useful to calculate the environmental
   impact of buildings and to make them accessible to designers and
   stakeholders acting in the building sector. The article aims to
   contribute to the international debate about environmental assessment
   indicators for buildings and the simplified LCA based tools. The
   Embodied Energy (EE) and the Embodied Carbon (EC) have been
   investigated. The former, related to primary energy content; the latter,
   associated with the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. EE and EC have
   been used as indicators for the development of a calculation tool named
   EURECA, for assessing the environmental impact of the building over its
   life cycle, as defined by the EN 15978:2011 standard. The Solar
   Decathlon Latin America and Caribbean's house designed and built by an
   international academic team has been an opportunity to check the
   indicators and the tool's effectiveness.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of building stocks from urban to transnational
   scales: A review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {316-332},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy consumption
   and environmental impacts worldwide. An assessment of the energy demand
   and environmental performance of building stocks at large spatial scales
   is increasingly needed for decision support in sustainable planning and
   policy making. While current bottom-up building stock models mainly
   focus on the operational energy use, a new research trend has introduced
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a more holistic environmental
   performance assessment including several stages of the building life
   cycle.
   This paper reviews a set of selected bottom-up LCA studies evaluating
   the environmental impact of building stocks at several scales, from
   urban to transnational. The selected studies were analyzed according to
   three common elements: building stock aggregation model, energy analysis
   and LCA. Two main stock aggregation approaches, archetypes and
   building-by-building, are applied to model individual buildings and
   extrapolate results at the stock level. Bottom-up energy models, either
   statistical or engineering-based, provide energy profiles for the
   operational phase of buildings. LCA is subsequently performed to assess
   the building environmental performance and support policy decisions.
   Current limitations and opportunities for the improvement of the LCA of
   large building stocks are finally addressed and discussed to support
   future works. Building stock aggregation models may be enhanced by
   addressing model calibration, integration with Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) and stock dynamics models. Uncertainty propagation,
   sensitivity analysis and model simplification are recommended for energy
   models and LCA to bridge data gaps and reduce computationally intensive
   models. Future research is encouraged on the inclusion of climate
   change, evolution of the energy supply and integrated modeling for the
   LCA of building stocks.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An increasing focus has been placed on clean energy, carbon neutrality,
   carbon footprint monitoring, and adaptation of building information
   modeling (BIM)-based facility management (FM). Hence, there is also a
   growing demand to evaluate and prioritize which BIM applications are the
   most relevant to FM and are the most beneficial in the asset lifecycle,
   particularly in the operations stage. To inform BIM-FM application on
   smart hospital management, this research introduces a one-systems method
   through an interpretive structural model (ISM) to establish a structural
   contextual interrelationship between BIM uses in the operations stages
   of the asset. Through a literature review, this research first
   summarizes facility management functionalities achievable by BIM-FM and
   establishes their pairwise contextual relationship. A structural
   self-interaction matrix (SSIM) is then established, followed by
   partitioning these functionalities into separate levels to form the ISM
   model, while using driving power and dependence to form a MICMAC
   analysis matrix. The finding that the BIM uses ``Environmental
   Monitoring and Building Performance{''} is the foundation that enables
   the other functionalities whilst validating that ad-hoc operations and
   maintenance activities enablement has the highest driving power, and
   automation and robotics have the highest dependency. Among the
   applications, energy monitoring plays a pivotal and transitional role
   with a strong dependency between airflow monitoring and solar
   monitoring, while its performance would directly impact emergency
   responses.},

Abstract = {The AEC sector is a significant component of the UK economy and is under
   enormous pressure to improve its environmental sustainability. Though
   significant progress has been achieved in reusing, remanufacturing, and
   recycling materials, using blockchain in the circular supply chain is
   still a relatively new idea and particularly challenging in the building
   industry. As a result, this study focuses on the importance of
   blockchain and circular economy in built-environment supply chains. We
   show the application method of utilising a blockchain-enabled digital
   platform and the idea of material passports to efficiently monitor
   materials and resources in the built environment. Based on the
   methodologies of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC),
   and Building Information Management (BIM), we suggest that blockchain
   can be used to track environmental performance (e.g. materials, energy,
   and carbon emissions) and value creation opportunities at each stage of
   the building life cycle.},

Abstract = {The merits and potential of Building Information Modelling (BIM) have
   been promoted for several years; however, its widespread adoption and
   development may potentially stagnate on account of a technical skills

   successfully deliver projects. This shortfall covers all aspects of BIM,
   and building performance and life cycle analysis in particular.
   Programmes such as Ecotect, Revit, Green Building Studio, and Project
   Vasari, have transformed data capture and analysis, enabling architects
   and systems engineers to visualise site analyses and to test preliminary
   designs. As BIM is a relatively new process which continues to develop
   rapidly, Higher Education Institutions need to respond to currency and
   change while striving to provide graduates with the advanced skills to
   satisfy the needs of the building industry. This work presents a case
   study of the application of Autodesk's Building Performance Analysis
   Certificate (BPAC) as a driver for learning in support of the

Abstract = {This study aimed to ascertain the research status of complexity issues
   in building information modeling (BIM) diffusion and identify future
   research directions in this field. A total of 366 relevant journal
   articles were holistically evaluated. The visualization analysis
   indicated that management aspects, emergent trends (such as green
   building, facility management, and automation), and theme clusters (such
   as interoperability, waste management, laser scanning, stakeholder
   management, and energy efficiency) are shaping BIM research towards
   complexity. Areas such as supply chain, cost, digital twin, and web are
   also essential. The manual qualitative evaluation classified the
   complexity issues in BIM diffusion research into three types
   (complexities of network-based BIM evolution, impact of BIM adoption
   circumstances, and BIM-based complexity reduction for informed decision
   making). It was concluded that BIM has been shifting towards information
   models and systems-based life cycle management, waste control for
   healthy urban environments, and complex data analysis from a big data
   perspective, not only in building projects but also in heritage and
   infrastructure, or at the city scale, for informed decision making and
   automatic responses. Future research should investigate the co-evolution
   between collaborative networks and BIM artefacts and work processes,
   quality improvement of BIM-based complex networks, BIM post-adoption
   behaviors influenced by complex environmental contexts, and BIM-based
   complexity reduction approaches.},

   Island in Taiwan, and drafted out urban design guideline based on
   analysis of urban ventilation design generated by building layout and
   its effect on building wind environment. The results can feedback to the
   planner and designer to modify the layout of buildings to have a more
   comfortable and energy saving new town.
   This research based on methods of the simulations obtained numerical
   predictions of flow characteristics around the buildings for studying
   the wind field of the Shezi Island performed. The dimensions of
   calculation domain were 771 m long, 624 m wide and 150 m high. Result of
   simulations showed that the layout characterized by street block type in

Abstract = {With global emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the Czech
   Republic needs to adapt the systems currently used for accessing
   projects to the new way of designing. Unfortunately, the main emphasis
   in the Czech Republic is still put on the first stage of the project,
   i.e. the creation of a 3D model. Converting a 3D model into a BIM model
   also requires information needed by other civil engineering fields.
   Consequently, it is necessary to determine which kinds of information
   must be supplied to BIM models and also how to input or import data from
   other software tools or systems. This article focuses on
   construction-economic systems, which comprise the cost estimation of
   buildings, modelling life-cycle costs, and administration in the
   operation phase of a building. The main problem encountered in the Czech
   Republic is the disparate nature of BIM databases, price databases, LCC
   databases and building administration databases. This article aims to
   propose a database of functional parts that could serve to connect the
   individual databases, or at least provide means to aggregate the
   individual databases in a proposed structure of functional units.},

Abstract = {Featured Application Building information modeling can be used as a

   Abstract The emergence of building information modeling (BIM)
   methodology requires the training of professionals with both specific
   and transversal skills. In this paper, a project-based learning
   experience carried out in the context of a project management course at
   the University of Extremadura is analyzed. To that end, a questionnaire
   was designed and given to students who participated in the initiative.
   Results suggest that BIM can be considered a virtual learning
   environment, from which students value the competences developed. The
   emotional performance observed was quite flat. Similarly, students
   valued the usefulness of the initiative. Students expressed a desire for
   the methodological change of the university classes, and thought that
   BIM methodology could be useful for other courses. The results obtained
   show a line of work to be done to improve the training of students and
   university teaching.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although a large number of studies on Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) have been conducted in the past decade, a lack of consensus
   remains among researchers and practitioners regarding the applications
   of BIM for the development of green buildings, the activity of making
   buildings in a way that protects the natural environment. As the
   usefulness of BIM has been widely recognized in the building and
   construction industry, there is an urgent need to establish an
   up-to-date synthesis on the nexus between BIM and green buildings. After
   an in-depth review of hundreds of journal articles published from 1999
   to 2016 and 12 widely used types of BIM software, this study provides a
   holistic understanding and critical reflection on the nexus between BIM
   and green buildings, which is systematically illustrated by a ``Green
   BIM Triangle{''} taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy indicates that the
   nexus between BIM and green buildings needs to be understood based on
   three dimensions, namely project phases, green attributes and BIM
   attributes. Following the proposed taxonomy, this paper systematically
   illustrated 1) the applications of BIM in supporting the design,
   construction, operation, and retrofitting processes of green buildings;
   2) the various functions of BIM for green building analyses such as
   energy, emissions, and ventilation analysis; 3) the applications of BIM
   in supporting green building assessments (GBA); and 4) research gaps and
   future research directions in this area. Through critical review and
   synthesis of BIM and green buildings based on evidence from both
   academic research and industrial practices, this paper provides
   important guidance for building researchers and practitioners to better
   align BIM development with green building development in the future.},

   the possibilities for adjustment of these procurement methods in the
   light of collaborative work-practices. The author does not claim to have

Abstract = {The need to use Building Information Modelling (BIM) for Construction
   and Demolition Waste (CDW) minimisation is well documented but most of
   the existing CDW management tools still lack BIM functionality. This
   study therefore assesses the expectations of stakeholders on how BIM
   could be employed for CDW management. After a review of extant
   literature to assess the limitations of existing CDW management tools,
   qualitative Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with
   professionals who are familiar with the use of BIM to understand their
   expectations on the use of BIM for CDW management. The 22 factors
   identified from the qualitative data analyses were then developed into a
   questionnaire survey. The exploratory factor analysis of the responses
   reveals five major groups of BIM expectations for CDW management, which
   are: (i) BIM-based collaboration for waste management, (ii) waste-driven
   design process and solutions, (iii) waste analysis throughout building
   lifecycle, (iv) innovative technologies for waste intelligence and
   analytics, and (v) improved documentation for waste management.
   Considering these groups of factors is key to meeting the needs of the
   stakeholders regarding the use of BIM for CDW management. These groups
   of factors are important considerations for the implementation and
   acceptance of BIM-based tools and practices for CDW management within
   the construction industry. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The need of building process industrialization has seed up the use of
   new Information Technologies to enhance the productivity and quality of
   building projects. In particular, the use of the Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) assets and real time follow-up based on the Cyber
   Physical System paradigm could be a source of valuable data to support
   planning and monitoring activities throughout the building life cycle.
   In the context of process industrialization one challenging issue is the
   transformation of design data into manufacturing data. The main
   contribution of this paper is the automatic transformation from
   engineering bills of material (e-BOM) to manufacturing (m-BOM) ones
   based on routing sheets and resources' availability status. Illustrated
   by an actual prefabricated building case study, a methodological
   approach to dynamically adapt the e-BOM to m-BOM supported by a generic
   BOM and its implementation architecture are proposed.},

Abstract = {In the recent decades, the high-resolution remote sensing, through 3D
   laser scanning and photogrammetry benefited historic buildings
   maintenance, conservation, and restoration works. However, the dense
   surface models (DSM) generated from the data capture have nonstructured
   features as lack of topology and semantic discretization. The process to
   create a semantically oriented 3D model from the DSM, using the of
   Building Information Model technology, is a possibility to integrate
   historical information about the life cycle of the building to maintain
   and improving architectural valued building stock to its functional
   level and safeguarding its outstanding historical value. Our approach
   relies on an ontology-based system to represent the knowledge related to
   the building. Our work outlines a model-driven approach based on the
   hybrid data acquisition, its post-processing, the identification of the
   building' main features for the parametric modeling, and the development
   of an ontological map integrated with the BIM model. The methodology
   proposed was applied to a large-scale industrial historical building,
   located in Brazil. The DSM were compared, providing a qualitative
   assessment of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Investment decisions for buildings made today largely determine their
   environmental impacts over many future decades due to their long
   lifetimes. Such decisions involve a trade-off between additional
   investments today and potential savings during use and at end of life -
   in terms of economic costs, primary energy consumption, greenhouse gas
   emissions and other environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA)
   is suited to identify measures and action to increase the resource
   efficiency and the environmental performance of buildings and
   construction. This paper gives an overview of an ongoing international
   research project within the IEA EBC with the overall aim to harmonise
   LCA approaches on buildings and foster life cycle thinking in the real
   estate and construction sectors. The objectives of the project are i) to
   establish a common methodology guideline to assess the life cycle based
   environmental impacts caused by buildings, ii) to establish methods for
   the development of specific environmental benchmarks for different types
   of buildings, iii) to derive regionally differentiated guidelines and
   tools for the use of LCA in building design and tools such as BIM, and
   iv) to improve data availability by developing national or regional
   databases with regionally differentiated LCA data tailored to the
   construction sector. To ensure practical solutions a number of case
   studies will be used to test and illustrate the consensus approaches and
   research issues.},

Title = {BIM-embedded life cycle carbon assessment of RC buildings using
   optimised structural design alternatives},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {587-600},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The implications of optimised structural designs in the life cycle
   carbon performance of buildings have been systematically overlooked in
   previous studies. The paper addresses this common limitation offering an
   integrated sustainable structural analysis at building level. To achieve
   this, a BIM-embedded approach was established utilising embodied carbon
   metrics and results from heuristic structural optimisation. A real
   building scenario was used to test the proposed approach in the context
   of multi-storey reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Results show how the
   building life cycle performance is affected by the use of structurally
   optimised designs. The structural floors in particular, not only cover
   the largest proportion of the embodied carbon in the structure but they
   are also responsible for a large proportion of the carbon emissions of
   the tested building elements. The results obtained in this paper
   justified the need for more comprehensive efforts in the design

Title = {Environmental performance of social housing in emerging economies: life
   cycle assessment of conventional and alternative construction methods in
   the Philippines},

Abstract = {The environmental impact of the social building stock is relevant,
   particularly in emerging economies. Life cycle thinking is not yet
   established, however. Locally available, alternative building concepts
   could potentially reduce the environmental impact of the construction
   segment. This paper examines the environmental performance of
   ``as-built{''} low-cost housing for an example of the Philippines, and
   the potential to reduce its environmental impact through use of three
   alternative building technologies: cement-bamboo frames, soil-cement
   blocks, and coconut board-based housing.
   Life cycle assessment models are implemented and evaluated with software
   SimaPro, using the single-impact indicators global warming potential
   (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) and the multi-impact indicator
   Impact2002+. According to EN 15978, the life cycle phase product and
   construction process (A), use stage (B), end-of-life (C) and
   supplementary information beyond the building life cycle (D) have been
   assessed. Theoretically calculated inflows from standard construction
   procedures used in phase A have been verified with 3 years of empirical
   data from implemented construction projects. For phases B, C and D,
   attention was given to service life, use-phase, allocation of waste
   products, biogenic carbon and land-use assumptions. Scenarios reflect
   the actual situation in the emerging economy. Processes, such as heat
   recovery from thermal utilization, which are not existing nor near to
   implementation, were excluded.
   For an assessment of the phases A-B-C-D with GWP, a 35\% reduction of
   environmental impact for soil-cement blocks, 74\% for cement-bamboo
   frame, and 83\% for coconut board-based houses is obtained relative to a
   concrete reference house. In absolute terms, this relates to a reduction
   of 4.4, 9.3, and 10.3 t CO2 equivalents over a service life of 25 years.
   CED showed higher impacts for the biogenic construction methods coconut
   board and cement-bamboo frames of +8.0 and +4.7\%, while the soil-cement
   technology was evaluated -7.1\% compared to GWP. Sixteen of 17 midpoint
   categories of Impact2002+ confirmed an overall reduction potential of
   the alternative building methods, with the midpoint category land
   occupation being the exception rating the conventional practice over the
   alternatives.
   It is concluded that the alternative construction technologies have
   substantial potential to reduce the environmental burden caused by the
   social housing sector. The service life of the alternative technologies
   plays a vital role for it. LCA for emerging economies needs to
   incorporate realistic scenarios applicable at their current state or
   belonging to the most probable alternatives to ensure valuable results.

Abstract = {Purpose
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and Product Carbon Footprints
   (PCFs) have a significant potential for contributing to
   consumption-based approaches to climate change. This paper provides an
   important building block towards a theoretical model of the factors
   accounting for variations in the availability of life cycle data across
   countries. It does so by positing a mechanism linking industry
   associations' institutional role within environmental policy processes
   to the availability of product life data and by empirically validating
   it. Methods Interviews, qualitative document analysis, web scraping,
   quantitative text analysis, set-theoretical causal reasoning, and
   process tracing. Results and discussion Environmental policies that
   stipulate industry-government deliberations and assign a coordinating or
   mediating role to industry peak associations can stimulate the exchange
   of environmental information among industrial sectors. The policy
   instruments of determination of `best available techniques' (BAT)
   towards standard setting, negotiated collective agreements and carbon
   pricing all contribute towards the institutionalisation of organised
   information exchange within industry. This lowers transaction costs for
   the monitoring, reporting and verification of sectoral environmental
   data and can thus be conducive to the creation of sectoral life cycle
   assessment data, with positive knock-on effects on the availability of
   firm- and product-specific LCA labels. Conclusions Industry
   associations' institutional role within environmental policy processes
   can partially explain cross-national variations in the availability of
   product life cycle inventories.},

Title = {A methodology to assess energy-demand savings and cost-effectiveness of
   adaptation measures in educational buildings in the warm Mediterranean
   region},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {5472-5486},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Educational building stock in Cyprus are a significant part of the
   public building stock, with these build-ings leaning towards being less
   energy-efficient, especially in comparison to other public buildings.
   The energy and climate directives set by the European Union for 2050
   call for changes in the building sector, particularly for existing
   public building stock. This study suggests a design approach and
   assessment for retrofitting scenarios, which meet energy demands for
   educational buildings in Cyprus, based on their long-term cost
   effectiveness. Adaptation measures refer to changes in the geometry,
   construction, and operation of buildings. The approach combines energy
   demand modelling through dynamic software simulation using Integrated
   Environmental Solutions (IES-VE) and retrofit options, ranked by life
   cycle costing analysis (LCCA). These options may have very different
   upfront costs, but also very different carbon implications, and they
   result in different life expectancy predictions. The research findings
   contributes to delivering novel knowledge in the rather limited
   literature regarding the implication of adaptation measures on energy
   performance of educational buildings in the Mediterranean region and
   especially in correlation to their life-cycle cost. The aim is to give
   the stakeholders as much information as possible regarding their
   interventions, so that they can make informed decisions. This
   information will then be used to develop a framework that may be used
   more extensively to support decision-making in retrofitting existing
   educational buildings for climate change resilience. (c) 2022 The

Abstract = {Purpose- This paper aims to investigate the theoretical and practical
   links between digital twin (DT) application in heritage facilities
   management (HFM) from a life cycle management perspective and to
   signpost the future development directions of DT in
   HFM.Design/methodology/approach- This state-of-the-art review was
   conducted using a systematic literature review method. Inclusive and
   exclusive criteria were identified and used to retrieve relevant
   literature from renowned literature databases. Shortlisted publications
   were analysed using the VOSviewer software and then critically reviewed
   to reveal the status quo of research in the subject area.Findings- The
   review results show that DT has been mainly adopted to support
   decision-making on conservation approach and method selection,
   performance monitoring and prediction, maintenance strategies design and
   development, and energy evaluation and management. Although many
   researchers attempted to develop DT models for part of a heritage
   building at component or system level and test the models using
   real-life cases, their works were constrained by availability of
   empirical data. Furthermore, data capture approaches, data acquisition
   methods and modelling with multi-source data are found to be the
   existing challenges of DT application in HFM.Originality/value- In a
   broader sense, this study contributes to the field of engineering,
   construction and architectural management by providing an overview of
   how DT has been applied to support management activities throughout the
   building life cycle. For the HFM practice, a DT-cum-heritage building
   information modelling (HBIM) framework was developed to illustrate how
   DT can be integrated with HBIM to facilitate future DT application in
   HFM. The overall implication of this study is that it reveals the
   potential of heritage DT in facilitating HFM in the urban development
   context.},

Title = {Uncertainty Quantification in Life Cycle Assessments Interindividual
   Variability and Sensitivity Analysis in LCA of Air-Conditioning Systems},

Abstract = {The life cycle environmental profile of energy-consuming products, such
   as air conditioning, is dominated by the products' use phase. Different
   user behavior patterns can therefore yield large differences in the
   results of a cradle-to-grave assessment. Although this variation and
   uncertainty is increasingly recognized, it remains often poorly
   characterized in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Today, pervasive
   sensing presents the opportunity to collect rich data sets and improve
   profiling of use-phase parameters, in turn facilitating quantification
   and reduction of this uncertainty in LCA. This study examined the case
   of energy use in building cooling systems, focusing on global warming
   potential (GWP) as the impact category. In Singapore, building cooling
   systems or air conditioning consumes up to 37\% of national electricity
   demand. Lack of consideration of variation in use-phase interaction
   leads to the oversized designs, wasted energy, and therefore reducible
   GWP. Using a high-resolution data set derived from sensor observations,
   energy use and behavior patterns of single-office occupants were
   characterized by probabilistic distributions. The interindividual
   variability and use-phase variables were propagated in a stochastic
   model for the life cycle of air-conditioning systems and simulated by
   way of Monte Carlo analysis. Analysis of the generated uncertainties
   identified plausible reductions in global warming impact through
   modifying user interaction. Designers concerned about the environmental
   profile of their products or systems need better representation of the
   underlying variability in use-phase data to evaluate the impact. This
   study suggests that data can be reliably provided and incorporated into
   the life cycle by proliferation of pervasive sensing, which can only
   continue to benefit future LCA.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant increase in studies related to Industry 4.0
   alongside the development of new technologies, devices and software,
   becoming one of the most relevant topics for years within the so-called

   fields in productivity, and digitalisation can help reduce this gap.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation in various project
   phases with other technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big Data,
   Blockchain or Geographic Information System (GIS) are the main drivers
   of Smart Construction. This paper provides an updated state-of-art of
   the BIM applications through different civil engineering projects and
   towards the use of new Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs). Hence, the integration of BIM in the Facility Management through

Abstract = {Featured Application This study aims to review the state of the art of
   visual programming algorithm applications in BIM infrastructure
   projects. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology improves
   architectural and infrastructure projects by digitizing their processes
   throughout their life cycle stages, such as design, construction,
   management, monitoring, and operation. In recent years, the automation
   of these processes has been favored by the use of visual programming
   (VP) tools that have replaced conventional programming languages for
   visual schemes. The use of these tools in architectural projects is
   becoming increasing popular. However, this is not the case in
   infrastructure projects, for which the use of VP algorithms remains
   scarce. The aim of this work is to encourage both scholars and engineers
   to implement VP tools in infrastructure projects. For this purpose, this
   work reviews, for the first time in the literature, the state-of-the-art
   and future research trends of VP tools in infrastructure projects.},

Title = {Quantitative approaches in life cycle assessment-part 2-multivariate

Abstract = {This study examines the use of inferential statistics, specifically
   multivariate correlation and regression, as a means of interpreting LCA
   data. It is believed that these methods provide additional context in
   understanding data and results, and may serve as a way to present the
   uncertain results that are inherent to LCA.
   Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five
   service life models (N = 45). Three environmental indicators were used:
   global warming potential, atmospheric ecotoxicity, and atmospheric
   acidification from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical
   and Other Environmental Impacts assessment method. Multivariate
   correlation was performed using nine variables, including cumulative
   life cycle impact, major replacement, major replacement (frequency),
   minor replacement, major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2,
   and total transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). The same data set
   was used for the regression analysis, although the variables were
   limited to major replacement, minor replacement, major repair, and minor
   repair (N = 45, 225 data points). SPSS software was used for all
   statistical calculations.
   Multivariate correlation analysis showed strong, statistically
   significant correlations between cumulative life cycle impact and major
   replacement across all environmental indicators. Similarly, the
   regression analysis showed strong R (2) values between cumulative life
   cycle impact and major replacement, such that the influence of all other
   variables was considerably diminished.
   The use of inferential statistics provides useful information with
   respect to the strength and statistical significance of correlations
   between variables as in multivariate correlation, and allows for
   predictive capacity of impact, as demonstrated through regression
   analysis. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the added value
   of these analytical tools.},

   on the empirical analysis of 8965 digital documents from 14 properties
   of 8 different owners, the article presents a model that will unify
   existing approaches and lead to the development of a document
   classification standard. This provides the basis for software systems to
   process relevant data and create timely information over the entire life
   cycle of a building. Further, it is shown that automated information
   extraction through artificial intelligence will become instrumental for
   enhanced and innovative business models and products in real estate such

Title = {BIM extension for the sustainability appraisal of conceptual steel

Abstract = {Contemporary advancements in Information Technology and the efforts from
   various research initiatives in the AEC industry are showing evidence of
   progress with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). BIM
   presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the
   vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its
   conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions
   to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that
   is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural
   engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the
   sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of
   structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of
   designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in
   the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions.
   Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so
   that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its
   inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and
   is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological
   footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling
   framework combining these three indicators in providing sustairiability
   assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and
   environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of
   feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information
   from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A
   prototype system is implemented using.NET and linked to the BIM enabled
   software, Revit Structures (TM). The system appraises alternative design
   solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work
   demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be
   employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions
   right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the
   utilized information modelling representations - in the form of a
   process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations
   - can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at
   the early stages of the structural design process. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {The digital twin bridge makes an important contribution on the way to
   predictive life cycle management. The potentials are many, especially in
   the life cycle phase ``operation ``. There, the digital twin bridge can
   serve as an efficient tool in terms of analyses, predictions, control
   and monitoring. The goal is optimized maintenance, the importance of
   which continues to grow in view of the current challenges for civil
   engineering structures. It is therefore particularly important that
   relevant stakeholders with their needs and requirements are involved in
   the conception of the digital twin bridge at an early stage. This
   approach is being pursued by the German Federal Highway Research
   Institute (BASt) in various research projects that already cover partial
   aspects of the digital twin and is also being continued in an ongoing
   project to develop an overall concept for the digital twin bridge.
   Possible use cases were collected and assigned to the topics of
   ``operational processes ``, ``maintenance planning and implementation ``
   and ``strategic life cycle management ``. In a workshop, the use cases
   were discussed and initially ranked by and with stakeholders. The
   results form an important basis for the elaboration of the modular
   overall concept of the digital twin bridge and the way into practice.},

Abstract = {Refurbishment projects are believed to be risky, complex, and fraught
   with many uncertainties. Some of these projects have reported
   substantial project delays, significant costs that sometimes overrun
   twice the budget, poor stakeholder engagement, and dissatisfaction with
   the project outcome by the refurbishment stakeholders. The introduction
   of BIM technology into construction practice seemed to be the game
   changer within AEC. However, despite the promising BIM benefits for the
   entire AEC, the adoption of BIM for refurbishment projects seems to be
   challenging due to the highly fragmented nature of construction practice
   which invariably creates difficulty in the integration of diverse
   information throughout the project life cycle. In this paper, we
   investigate the effects and challenges of BIM adoption in refurbishment
   projects across New Zealand, adopting literature review and preliminary
   interview methodology to this end. The result of the study shows that
   the refurbishment projects are unique in nature and differ from the
   construction of new buildings. They are also highly driven by the
   project cost and time of project delivery.},

Abstract = {This study concerning green BIM focuses on the integrated application of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) and building performance analysis
   (BPA) software as tools for the design and analysis of building
   projects, and employs a sequential decision-making cycle and
   continuously improving design to achieve an optimal proposal consistent
   with environmental effectiveness. Taking a new Taichung hotel
   construction project energy consumption design optimization as an
   example, this study relied on the steps of (1) Determination of the
   scope of discussion of the proposal within the building life cycle, (2)
   Setting of energy conservation targets, (3) Accessing to external
   climate data, (4) Entering internal settings, (5) Implementation of
   energy conservation calculation module, (6) Visualization analysis and
   hot spot tracking (7) Proposal Revision, and (8) Optimal proposal, to
   verify the green BIM concept. With regard to the setting of energy
   conservation targets, this study recommends that building energy use
   intensity (EUI) be used as an energy load measurement unit of integrated
   performance indicators, and employs performance optimization percentage
   as a rating criterion. In accordance with this method, green BIM
   combined with assessment of green building indicators is as a means of
   facilitating integrated design and analysis decision-making.},

Abstract = {This empirical paper examines whether the age of software products can
   explain the turnaround between the release of security advisories and
   the publication vulnerability information. Building on the theoretical
   rationale of vulnerability life cycle modeling, this assertion is
   examined with an empirical sample that covers operating system releases
   from Microsoft and two Linux vendors. Estimation is carried out with a
   linear regression model. The results indicate that the age of the
   observed Microsoft products does not affect the turnaround times, and
   only feeble statistical relationships are present for the examined Linux
   releases. With this negative result, the paper contributes to the
   vulnerability life cycle modeling research by presenting and rejecting
   one theoretically motivated and previously unexplored question. The
   rejection is also a positive result; there is no reason for users to
   fear that the turnaround times would significantly lengthen as operating
   system releases age.},

Title = {REVIEW OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF NEW ZEALAND
   CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {569-587},
Abstract = {The New Zealand construction industry continues to face pressures to
   improve productivity and lower construction costs. With the need to
   build more houses and infrastructure, quicker, to high quality and on
   time, there is a need to upscale the use of advanced technologies. Going
   digital is a solution that can transform the construction industry by
   improving productivity measures. The objectives of this paper are to: 1
   Identify the availability of transformative technologies and their
   potential impact on productivity improvement across the construction
   life cycle and, 2. To investigate the benefits and barriers to
   technology-uptake in New Zealand construction. This paper is a review of
   digital technologies which analyzes their impact on productivity across
   the construction life cycle. As a basis for analysis, the digital
   technologies are isolated into three key productivity improvement
   functions: (1) Ubiquitous Digital Access, (2) Whole Building
   Whole-of-Life (WBWOL) decision making, and (3) Cost Reduction
   Engineering. This study is a literature-based theoretical exploration,
   aimed at signifying digitization as a function of productivity
   performance in the New Zealand construction industry. From a practical
   perspective, clients and contractors may be convinced to invest in
   digital technologies, increasing or accelerating uptake and more fully
   realizing the benefits digital technologies could add to productivity
   performance, growth and long-term success. This study may provide useful
   information for researchers regarding the development of case studies by
   analyzing organizations that implement technological innovations, their
   successful actions/processes, barriers overcoming actions, and sources
   of new ideas.},

Pages = {433-452},
Abstract = {Purpose Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of generating
   and managing building data during the building's life cycle. To increase
   productivity in building design and construction, BIM uses
   three-dimensional (3D) real-time, dynamic building modeling software.
   Because of its versatile features, BIM use is on the rise and
   researchers are exploring its application in new disciplines. The
   purpose of this study is to map out how BIM is used in the construction
   industry, while identifying and highlighting the research gaps in the
   literature.
   Design/methodology/approach To investigate the status quo of knowledge
   about BIM, the authors conducted a comprehensive literature review. They
   applied and extended a methodology for reviewing BIM-related
   publications through a four-dimensional meta-analysis system and its
   categories, which has been partially adapted previously.
   Findings Majority of studies applying BIM for the construction phase of
   civil engineering projects were done within universities; none used BIM
   for the construction of intermediate railway stations.
   Practical implications To increase the construction efficiency of
   intermediate railway stations, applying the BIM concept for generation
   and management of station data should be considered for future research.
   Originality/value Furthermore, one of the main goals of this research
   paper is to explore the adoption of BIM in civil engineering
   construction projects, in particular the construction of intermediate
   railway stations.},

Abstract = {Thanks to the digital revolution, the construction industry has seen a
   recognizable evolution, where the world has been heading towards modern
   constructions based on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   This evolution was marked by the integration of this paradigm with
   immersive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality
   (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). During the last few years, the development
   of BIM started to emerge. This paper proposes a Systematic Literature
   Review (SLR) of recent studies about the integration of BIM with
   immersive environments using VR/AR/MR technologies. Four electronic
   databases were exploited to search for eligible studies, namely: Google
   Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Science direct. From an
   initial cohort of 239 studies, 28 were retained for analysis. The main
   findings of this review have been focused on stages of the projects'
   life cycle in which the immersive technologies are being implemented,
   approaches/techniques used to ensure the integration of BIM with the
   three immersive technologies, along with the current limitations and
   perspectives.},

Title = {BIM for heritage science: a review},
Journal = {HERITAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new process that is spreading
   in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction field. It allows the
   creation of virtual building models, which can be linked to numerical
   data, texts, images, and other types of information. Building
   components, such as walls, floors, etc. are modelled as ``smart
   objects{''}, i.e. they are defined by numerical parameters, such as
   dimensions, and are embedded with other kinds of information, such as
   building materials and properties. Stored data are accessible and
   modifiable by all different professionals involved in the same project.
   The BIM process has been developed for new buildings, and it allows to
   plan and manage the whole building life-cycle. BIM for built heritage
   has started to be researched recently, and its use is still not
   widespread. Indeed, built heritage is characterised by complex
   morphology and non-homogeneous features, which clash with BIM's
   standardised procedures. Moreover, to date, BIM does not allow fully
   automated procedures to model heritage buildings. This review focuses on
   the survey and digitisation phases, which can be seen as the initial
   phases of application of BIM in conservation projects. It also briefly
   covers the modelling stage. Here we present the main methodologies
   developed for BIM for built heritage. Issues about digitisation are also
   highlighted, principally in connection with the unavailability of
   automated processes. During the last 10 years, research has led to
   promising results; for example, videogame interfaces have been used to
   simulate virtual 3D tours that display in a single interface the 3D
   model and the database containing metadata, and new software plug-ins
   have been developed, to easily create ``smart objects{''}. Nevertheless,
   further research is needed to establish how BIM can support the practice
   of building conservation. There is a gap in BIM's information holding
   capacities, namely the storage of cultural and historical documentation,
   as well as monitored and simulated data relevant for preventive
   conservation. Future work should focus on the development of new tools
   that will be able to store and share all the relevant metadata.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {1009-1022},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) represents a workflow whose
   application on a construction project will enable all involved players
   to compile as well as work with information on every aspect of a
   building in a common model/database. Through BIM, the entire building
   can be virtually designed and built on a computer. BIM touches every
   part of a building's life cycle starting from the design phase well into
   the construction phase and beyond that into asset management. This
   research examines the experiences of early adopters of BIM and use that
   insight to introduce BIM, specially focusing on the structural analysis
   and design stage of a building. The study demonstrates how all
   structural design activities can be integrated with each other and how
   cross-discipline collaboration with the architect can be achieved
   through the adoption of BIM without leaving ones customary structural
   design platform. As a demonstration, a sample building is modelled using
   Revit along with conventional structural software packages ETABS and
   SAFE. Plugins and applications were developed for these software
   packages to facilitate interoperability amongst them so that they all
   act together as a single platform. Modelling, analysis, design and clash
   detections were facilitated by applying BIM. Major benefits of employing
   BIM in a structural design project are illustrated through this
   research.},

   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the
   digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building
   information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall
   life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration
   with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical
   analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share
   several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to
   address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management,
   where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a
   systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to
   retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results
   found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and
   suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and
   practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address
   ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the
   BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA
   approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration
   topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for
   BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is
   the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to
   perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems
   for asset management.},

Title = {Risk assessment of renewable energy-based island microgrid using the
   HFLTS-cloud model method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {284},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Difficulty in power supply has always been the main factor hindering the
   sustainable development of islands. It is an effective way to address
   the energy supply issue of off-grid islands by building island microgrid
   system with abundant renewable energy, such as wind energy and solar
   energy. However, island microgrids offer a mix of the high penetration
   rate of renewable energy and the complex island environment, being
   confronted with many challenges in the whole life cycle. To implement
   the project smoothly and make full use of the advantages of renewable
   energy-based island microgrids, a risk assessment must be incorporated.
   In this study, based on a three-dimensional model, we take a holistic
   view of identifying risks that includes four categories (technical,
   economic, environmental and social aspects). Later, a reasonable and
   applicable risk assessment framework is constructed, in which the
   fuzziness and randomness of information are taken into consideration.
   The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is used to endow the index
   evaluation information, and the cloud model is used to transform the
   evaluation information. The final results show that the overall risk
   level of China's island microgrids is ``Slightly High{''}, particularly
   in the technical aspect. Furthermore, corresponding mitigation
   strategies are put forward. This study conducts a comprehensive study on
   the risk assessment and risk response measures of island microgrids,
   which is conducive to deal with potential risks, thereby to minimize the
   loss and promote the island microgrid development. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper presents the development of a framework for leveraging the 3D
   nature of spaces, their attributes, and sensor location data in
   conjunction with building management system (BMS) sensor data to allow
   both users and operators to more easily access building data in the
   operations and maintenance of facilities. A case study, using data from
   various sensors of an operational facility and data from the building
   information model (BIM) used in the construction of the facility, is
   presented in a spatial data visualization framework. The initial
   prototype focuses on 3D data visualization by building occupants to
   enable exposure and access to facility data. The framework offers an
   initial system to integrate two typically disparate data streams to aid
   in building life-cycle data integration as well as increase transparency
   and awareness of operations for building occupants.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM), a novel technology in the
   architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry, contains
   various data and information, which is so practical and can be required
   by many stakeholders during the project's life cycle. For non-technical
   users with limited or no skill in dealing with BIM software, access to
   this data can be time-consuming, and tedious. Automating the information
   extraction from BIM models can efficiently address this need. In this
   regard, this research proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   framework to facilitate information extraction from BIM models.
   Therefore, the user can ask questions and receive answers from the
   framework. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP), an ontology
   database (IfcOWL) and an NLP method {[}latent semantic analysis (LSA)],
   the purpose of the user is understood by the framework through syntactic
   analysis and semantic understanding of the question and answer to the
   user, based on functions. The results show that the speed of answering
   the questions in this framework is up to five times faster than the
   manual while maintaining high accuracy.},

Title = {A Method to Facilitate Uncertainty Analysis in LCAs of Buildings},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly becoming a common technique
   to assess the embodied energy and carbon of buildings and their
   components over their life cycle. However, the vast majority of existing
   LCAs result in very definite, deterministic values which carry a false
   sense of certainty and can mislead decisions and judgments. This article
   tackles the lack of uncertainty analysis in LCAs of buildings by
   addressing the main causes for not undertaking this important activity.
   The research uses primary data for embodied energy collected from
   European manufacturers as a starting point. Such robust datasets are
   used as inputs for the stochastic modelling of uncertainty through Monte
   Carlo algorithms. Several groups of random samplings between 101 and 107
   are tested under two scenarios: data are normally distributed
   (empirically verified) and data are uniformly distributed. Results show
   that the hypothesis on the data no longer influences the results after a
   high enough number of random samplings (104). This finding holds true
   both in terms of mean values and standard deviations and is also
   independent of the size of the life cycle inventory (LCI): it occurs in
   both large and small datasets. Findings from this research facilitate
   uncertainty analysis in LCA. By reducing significantly the amount of
   data necessary to infer information about uncertainty, a more widespread
   inclusion of uncertainty analysis in LCA can be encouraged in
   assessments from practitioners and academics alike.},

Title = {Developing a Building Fire Information Management System Based on 3D
   Object Visualization},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In a building fire disaster, a variety of information on hazardous
   factors is crucial for emergency responders, facility managers, and
   rescue teams. Inadequate information management limits the accuracy and
   speed of fire rescue activities. Furthermore, a poor decision-making
   process, which is solely dependent on the experiences of emergency
   responders, negatively affects the fire response activities. Building
   information modeling (BIM) enables the sharing of locations of critical
   elements and key information necessary for effective decision-making on
   disaster prevention. However, it is non-trivial to integrate and link
   the relevant information generated during the life cycle of the
   building. In particular, the information requirements for building fires
   should be retrieved in the BIM software because most of them have
   spatial characteristics. This paper proposes a prototype system for a
   building's fire information management using three-dimensional (3D)
   visualization by deriving the relevant information required for
   mitigating building fire disasters. The proposed system (i.e., Building
   Fire Information Management System (BFIMS)) automatically provides
   reliable fire-related information through a computerized and systematic
   approach in conjunction with a BIM tool. It enables emergency responders
   to intuitively identify the location data of indoor facilities with its
   pertinent information based on 3D objects. Through scenario-based
   applications, the system has effectively demonstrated that it has
   contributed to an improvement of rapid access to relevant},

Title = {A Semantic and Social Approach for Real-Time Green Building Rating in
   BIM-Based Design},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {While many countries have developed green building rating systems
   (GBRSs) to promote the concept of green buildings, it is difficult for
   designers to achieve better sustainability in the design process when
   using the real-time green building rating score as a reference. This
   paper proposes an intelligent green building rating (iGBR) framework
   supported by a semantic and social approach to realize real-time rating
   in building design. The framework features four components: (1) An
   ontology that is used to encapsulate the knowledge of green building
   rating, (2) score calculation rules that are encoded in Semantic Web
   Rule Language (SWRL), (3) Autodesk Forge, which is employed as a
   building information modeling (BIM)-based design platform to synchronize
   design models from different professions in the cloud, and (4) a group
   chat tool to connect all project participants in a social communication
   environment to effectively exchange data/information required for score
   calculation. A prototype iGBR system is developed based on the
   Evaluation Standard for Green Building of China (ESGBC) to verify the
   framework, so that a total of 95 articles can be assessed automatically
   in the real-time approach.},

Abstract = {IT in the civil engineering curriculum is often fragmented into courses
   that emphasize either design tools (e.g., CAD), or packages for
   analysis, planning and modeling. Graduating students often report a lack
   of coherence in the IT tools used in their courses and a distinctive gap
   in their junior years where technology skills are under-used or
   forgotten. Building Information Modeling (BIND may offer the opportunity
   to unify disparate technologies to provide a coherent IT skill set for
   civil engineering students to address the range of problems in the
   infrastructure and facilities life cycle. BIM is a framework that
   combines visualization and parametric modeling in a way that allows
   students to simultaneously consider the interdependent processes of
   planning, analysis, design and construction. This research will evaluate
   the feasibility of embedding BIM in the civil engineering curriculum
   with the goal of defining and promoting an extensible skill set that is
   reinforced through a comprehensive transportation design problem.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to provide a Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)-based management system for the Civil Engineering School (ETSICCP)
   at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid with a long-term development
   perspective. A Building Information Modeling (BIM) management system for
   complex infrastructure facilities demands a detailed 3-Dimensional model
   according to future management requirements. In this study, the
   infrastructure of the ETSICCP was modeled on various phases and
   synchronized with not only external educational information but also
   with facility management (FM) parameters. The methodology followed in
   this study ranges from the blank paper to a BIM-based detailed FM system
   oriented to educational scheduling throughout the infrastructure
   providing real time information synchronized with spreadsheets and a 3-D
   model. The result of this paper provides multiples future management
   lines, like COVID-19 BIM-management or synchronization with local public
   transports' applications (mainly metro and bus transport systems),
   through a public accessible Application Programming Interface (API). The
   significance of this research relies on the generation of an information
   and management system, based on a BIM model of a university campus. This
   project was designed for all the agents involved in its operation,
   students, lecturers, and managers. All these agents have a level of

Abstract = {BIM is the latest technique, tool, methodology, and workflows in
   construction projects. Initially, the construction industry was using
   the BIM technology only for the construction of buildings, on knowing
   the advantages of this technology the Architecture, Engineering,
   Construction, Operator and Owner (AECOO) industry around the world has
   started using it for vertical and horizontal projects. This paper
   discusses the adoption of BIM in the vertical building and the
   horizontal projects in construction and asset management in the life
   cycle of the structure. Usage of BIM helps the stakeholders from the
   planning stage to completion and during maintenance of the structure by
   providing high clarity to everyone involved in the project. The
   requirement of time as 4D and money as 5D for each stage of construction
   can be incorporated while modeling the structure. The specification of
   each item of the work in the structure can be incorporated in the model
   to refine the same in the future. The conditions of the structure in
   later time can be marked in the model to arrive at the suitable remedial
   measure and also BIM modeling helps to know the time periodical
   maintenance.},

Title = {BIM business value for asset owners: key issues and challenges},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},

Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Purpose There is a need to develop the understanding of asset owners
   concerning the constraints of building information modelling (BIM)
   implementation, and its subsequent value realisation activities in asset
   management (AM) cannot be overstated. This is because the life cycle
   cost of a built asset is three times more than construction costs and
   five times more than the initial investment outlays. Hence, this paper
   investigated and identified the key issues and challenges of realising
   BIM business value in AM. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted
   an explorative and deductive approach. A qualitative four-stage research
   design strategy was adopted using 10 semi-structured interviews and
   document analysis to collect data. These were analysed through
   qualitative thematic analysis. Findings The study identified 15 key
   barriers and classified them from the perspective BIM governance
   dimensions, namely people, process and technology. Furthermore, the
   study identified that more process-based challenges are experienced than
   people or technology. Of the identified challenges, three are
   people-related, eight are process-related and four are
   technology-related.
   Practical implications - The analysed results focussed on the
   development of the understanding of asset owners, policymakers and
   researchers regarding the complex challenges that hinder BIM utilisation
   and value realisation in AM. The findings of this paper support progress
   towards enhanced BIM adoption in the architecture, engineering and
   construction (AEC) industry by highlighting the significance of the
   identified challenges, their nature (people-, process- or
   technology-based) and the resultant effect on BIM business value
   realisation during asset operations.
   Originality/value The original contribution of this study was the
   exploration and identification of the current challenges experienced by
   asset owners in implementing BIM during asset operations and how these
   affect the derivation of BIM business value.},

Abstract = {Rapid advancement on digitalisation is changing the way buildings are
   planned, designed, built and managed nowadays. A collaborative
   computer-based environment known as Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   is one of the advancements introduced as a platform to boost up the
   efficiency of the construction industry. However, poorly designed,
   constructed and managed building or infrastructure contribute to
   environmental issues such as CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Thus,
   attachment of sustainability element in BIM not only increase the
   efficiency of the project but also can help to plan, design and
   construct in a more environmentally friendly way. A study on the overall
   energy use throughout the construction life cycle is needed to identify
   the most critical stages and to develop energy-reduction strategies via
   BIM. Thus, this paper provides an intensive review of BIM understanding,
   its energy analysis practices in the construction phase and existing
   building environmental assessment tools in BIM. To achieve this, an
   in-depth review was carried out focusing on the content analysis of a
   few journal articles related to BIM, energy analysis and sustainability
   assessment tool. Hence, this paper contributes by discussing the wide
   variety of building environmental assessment instruments and
   categorising existing tools to be used in the BIM.},

   government procurement: A case study for concrete in a new building

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {345},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {There are numerous strategies that can be used to reduce the embodied
   carbon footprint of real property investments, many of which can be
   accomplished for no additional cost and with minimal performance
   impacts. This study aims to propose the incorporation of the life cycle
   carbon quantification into the government procurement of real property
   process in order to reach out to low-carbon durable and sustainable
   structures as a theoretical contribution. As a practical contribution,
   an integrated embodied carbon measurement application is developed in a
   building information model (BIM) environment to act as a decision making
   tool in a government office building as a case study. It supports
   updating procurement policies and procedures to request construction
   materials with lower embodied carbon in construction. Analysis of
   concrete assembly groups in the case study along with determination of
   volume of concrete in each assembly is conducted to devise a reasonable
   list of elements to be considered for low-carbon concrete compliancy
   based on an industry average benchmarking approach. Considering the
   numerous concrete vendors that supply concrete products to a given
   region, a novel concrete embodied carbon measurement approach is
   proposed where cradle-to-construction impacts were accounted for. The
   outcome of the proposed integrated tool showed the procurement of
   concrete mix design from one specific nearby facility resulted in more
   efficient GHG reductions and the results showed especially the
   significance of considering transportation impacts of delivering
   ready-mixed concrete elements to the project site.},

Title = {A BIM-based framework for optimization and assessment of buildings' cost
   and carbon emissions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Global concerns regarding climate change have attracted increasing
   attention from researchers in the previous years. The building industry
   is responsible for a significant share of total energy use and
   Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The severity of this problem has drawn
   increased attention from researchers in recent times; however, a more
   comprehensive analysis of buildings' emissions is still warranted. This
   study aims to propose and evaluate a framework for estimating the total
   carbon emissions, while also considering economic factors of the
   project. Focusing on the embodied and operational stages of buildings'
   life cycle, which are critical phases, the objective of the framework is
   to provide a straightforward method for optimizing operational carbon,
   calculating embodied carbon, and quantifying costs and savings. The
   developed method and findings are valuable resources for designers and
   decision-makers seeking to make more informed sustainability-related
   choices. An average reduction of 24.92\% in carbon emissions was
   observed after implementing the proposed framework in a case study, and
   the economic analysis was repeated in several countries to provide
   further insights. Based on an economic evaluation of suggested
   alternatives, energy pricing is a crucial factor in determining the
   return on investment.},

Abstract = {Linked data (LD) is a technology to support publishing structured data
   on the web so that it may be interlinked. Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) is a key enabler to support integration of building data within
   the buildings life cycle (BLC). LD can therefore provide better access
   and more semantically useful querying of BIM data. The integration of
   BIM into the geospatial domain provides much needed contextual
   information about the building and its surroundings, and can support
   geospatial querying over BIM data. Creating GeoSPARQL queries for users
   who are non experts in semantic web technologies can be a challenge. In
   this paper we present a visualization tool built upon HTML5 and WebGL
   technologies that supports queries over linked data without the need to
   understand the resulting SPARQL queries. The interactive web interface
   can be quickly extended to support new use cases, for example, related
   to 3D geometries. The paper discusses the underlying data management,
   the methodology for uplifting several open data sources into Resource
   Description Framework (RDF), and the front-end implementation tested
   over a sample use case. Finally some discussion and future work is
   given, with a focus on how this tool can potentially support BIM
   integration.},

Title = {Using BIM to improve building energy efficiency-A scientometric and
   systematic review},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {250},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO)
   sector is responsible for a great proportion of the global energy
   consumption and associated environmental impacts. On this front, and
   from a sustainability improvement perspective, the use of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) capabilities could represent an opportunity
   to improve these impacts in all steps of a building's life. The main
   purpose of the current paper is to identify the areas in which BIM
   technology can or already is playing a role in improving building
   efficiency, helping AECO sector stakeholders in reducing environmental
   impacts. In the current paper, the impact of using BIM to enhance the
   building energy efficiency is explored through a scientometric analysis
   and a systematic literature review. There is a high interest among the
   scientific community in these fields, given the recent rise in
   publications and citation numbers. Moreover, there is a lack of
   interoperability between BIM and energy analysis tools, a high potential
   for integrating BIM with other technologies, such as thermography,
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and monitoring, and a very positive
   impact from the use of BIM in the optimisation of construction solutions
   which allow energy savings in the AECO sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Decision support system (DSS) for selecting sustainable insulation

Abstract = {Efforts to improve the sustainability of the building construction
   sector have tended to focus on reducing operational energy cost, whereas
   sustainability considerations in the material selection at the design
   and construction phase have received less attention due to construction
   budget constraints. The present study proposes a decision support system
   (DSS) to assist decision-makers in accounting for sustainability in
   their construction material selections. We demonstrate how the developed
   DSS can be used to identify the most sustainable insulation materials
   and thicknesses among commercially available alternatives. The DSS ranks
   available alternatives by incorporating individual project information,
   material information, and the decision maker's preferences. Technique
   for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and
   Pareto search technique are combined in the methodology. By limiting the
   alternatives to the `Pareto front' of life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   life cycle cost in a multi-objective optimization setting, we seek to
   reduce subjectivity in the multi-criterion decision-making process.
   Moreover, product-specific environmental product declaration is used to
   calculate the embodied energy for the LCA. The framework recommends
   commercially available materials and thicknesses accordingly. The
   proposed method is programmed in Python to establish a user interface
   for data input and output of results.},

Abstract = {This pedagogical study aimed to demonstrate an updated Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) educational activity in CEM (i.e.,
   construction engineering and management) students' final semester
   project. It investigated students' perceptions of BIM and the project.
   Student feedback provided insights for linking education to practice,
   for example, what caused differences between manual estimates and
   BIM-generated quantity take-off. Four different project deliverable
   options demonstrated how educational theories could be embedded in BIM
   education. The novelty of this study lies in two aspects: firstly, this
   pedagogical research views the CEM education at the curriculum level by
   linking earlier years' core CEM courses into the final project work;
   secondly, by designing four different options of BIM-related
   deliverables, subgroup analyses test how different factors, such as
   teamwork verse individual work, and BIM application level, could affect
   students' learning outcomes. The current study also led to more future
   explorations in research-informed teaching in the CEM curriculum.},

Title = {Analysis of the Operation of an Aerothermal Heat Pump in a Residential
   Building Using Building Information Modelling},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) are responsible for the
   largest share of energy use in residential buildings in Spain and play
   an important role in the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings
   (NZEB). Building Information Modelling (BIM) is expected to promote more
   efficient buildings through evaluation of different design options. BIM
   can be used as a platform from which to gather information that can be
   conveyed to energy efficiency simulation tools. The objective of this
   paper was to implement the model of a reversible air-to-water heat pump
   in EnergyPlus 8.9. This model was employed to analyze the performance of
   an aerothermal heat pump system (B) in a residential building under
   different Spanish climates compared to a conventional Heating,
   Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system (A). Significant primary
   energy savings were achieved with system B compared to system A. These
   energy savings were higher in climates with a significant heating demand
   such as Madrid (27.4\%) and Burgos (33.6\%), and in cities with a mild
   climate such as Barcelona (37\%). The residential building studied in
   this work was classified as Class A according to the CO2 emissions scale
   when using the aerothermal heat pump system, and as Class B when using
   the conventional HVAC system.},

Title = {Integrated system for BIM-based collaborative design},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {196-206},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {For effective collaboration among construction project participants, the
   use of Building Information Model (BIM) has become more common
   throughout the building life cycle. However, due to the use of different
   BIM-based software among collaborators during the design, a variety of
   problems have occurred, including loss of data, difficulty in
   communication, and poor work efficiency. Hence, this study proposes an
   integrated design system for the improvement of BIM-based collaborative
   design. For this purpose, problems are derived based on an analysis of
   conventional BIM-based collaborative design. In addition, a concept for
   the development of the BIM-based integrated design system is established
   from integration methodologies. Based on `functional integration,'
   `integrated information management' and `integrated process support,'
   the integrated design system is implemented through the combination of
   three modules: BIM Modeler, BIM Checker and BIM Server. To test the
   integrated design system, a case study on a hospital building design is
   reviewed, and improvements compared to the conventional system are
   examined. It appears that the proposed system can enhance design quality
   and productivity by providing necessary support for collaborative design
   in an integrated manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Economic evaluation of building energy retrofits: A fuzzy based approach},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {395-406},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Ongoing climate action programs are prompting more stringent energy
   performance standards for buildings. Consequently, energy retrofitting
   of existing buildings has become a common climate action initiative
   around the World. Building owners are keen to assess the technical and
   financial feasibility of energy retrofitting in pre -project planning
   stages. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) involves assessment of the
   economic cost of an asset or a service. LCCA, which is a data -intensive
   process, is heavily affected by data uncertainties; hoWever, traditional
   deterministic LCCA models are oblivious to data uncertainty and this can
   have a significant effect on the final decision. As a solution, this
   paper proposes a novel LCCA approach for building energy retrofits. The
   proposed approach calculates life cycle cost (LCC) by adopting fuzzy set
   theory. In order to illustrate the proposed methodology, a case study
   was conducted for a public building operated in the Okanagan region of
   British Columbia, Canada. Two energy retrofit alternatives a major
   retrofit and a deep retrofit were compared using the proposed fuzzy set
   theory -based approach and the traditional deterministic LCCA approach.
   Even though the deterministic result had a strong membership to the
   fuzzy membership function of the LCC, the range of possible LCC is wide.
   Use of the fuzzy-based approach would enable the forecasting of possible
   future LCC as a result of changes in macro-economic factors. This
   information would allow building managers to plan for adverse future
   scenarios. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been increasingly adopted by
   construction project managers, as it covers the entire building life
   cycle and allows better coordination among different specialities.
   Mobile robots, on the other hand, are becoming the next frontier on
   automation of construction processes, and can largely exploit the
   geometric and semantic information provided by BIM models for many of
   their tasks. This work, in the context of the COBOLLEAGUE European
   project, presents a BIM-based interface that processes 3D building
   information, appending structural data to the pose-graph of a
   simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system used by a mobile
   robot. This enables the robot to access a 3D map of the reference model
   and to determine its own pose in the construction environment, saving
   time and being able to perform autonomous navigation without previously
   exploring the map. Also, the methodology presented enables tracking the
   construction state and flagging u pdates t o t he r eference model as
   well, a relevant feature for the construction industry. Results from
   simulations with publicly available models and real tests at an
   industrial site indicate a coherent mapping and consistent robot
   localization over time.},

Abstract = {The fatigue safety assessment of critical details in steel bridges is
   dominated by several uncertainties mainly related to load modelling. The
   use of integrated weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems in roadway bridges
   allows to collect all the necessary information for tracking actual
   traffic conditions. Based on WIM data, the uncertainty associated to the
   evaluation of the probability of fatigue failure is reduced, allowing
   the optimal scheduling of repair and maintenance activities and thus
   improving safety and economic savings. The paper presents a methodology
   for estimating fatigue life cycle cost (LCC) of roadway bridges equipped
   with a WIM system that considers uncertainties in measurement and
   modelling errors. The procedure allows the quantification of the
   economic gain enabled by WIM systems, useful in assessing the
   cost/accuracy trade-off for a given WIM system. It is found that the
   continuous use of a WIM system may improve the rate of decrease of the
   structural reliability index, compared with temporally limited use of
   WIM data. The periodic update of the reliability index and of the
   probability of failure based on WIM measurements results in a rather
   accurate estimation of the fatigue life cycle cost, which is crucial in
   identifying the payback time of the WIM system.},

Abstract = {Correctness level of data is the key of the construction industry
   success. Today, there is a novel widespread tool in construction sector
   which is building information modelling (BIM). BIM assists as a
   collective intelligence supply for data about a service and improves
   closeness among distinct stakeholder concerned in a project. The usual
   problems confronted by construction sector are cost increasing and
   schedule delays. BIM will certainly assist to reduce these
   circumstances. This article used a case study to show how the applying
   of BIM systems on a full construction project life cycle cost can
   decrease project budgets and enhance project time. Moreover, it is going
   to focus on integrating the traditional 4D BIM (project schedule) and
   the cost of every project item to form 5D BIM. This will simplify
   several cost associated actions such as controlling the construction
   project cost. At the end of this study, it is found out that the
   variance between planned costs and actual costs decreased from 12\% to
   5\% when 5D BIM is used instead of traditional methods. Therefore,
   accurate cost estimates and clash finding are the useful outcomes of 5D
   BIM.},

Title = {Techno economic and life cycle assessment of olefin production through
   CO2 hydrogenation within the power-to-X concept},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {469},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The paper deals with exhaustive process modelling, techno-economic and
   life cycle assessment (TEA/LCA) of olefin (ethylene and propylene)
   production through captured CO2 and electrolytic hydrogen. Olefins are
   important building block chemicals with several applications and carbon
   capture and utilisation (CCU) can provide a sustainable production
   route. The proposed system involves direct air capture (DAC) of CO2;
   proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis for hydrogen
   production, methanol synthesis, methanol to olefins (MTO) upgrade, and
   power generation from off-shore wind turbines. This study proposes a new
   integrated process as the first attempt to holistically assess a whole
   CCU assembly aiming at olefins production. Processing modelling has been
   implemented using the Aspen plus V12.1 and MATLAB R2022a software to
   solve the mass and energy balances of each unit operation. The modelling
   results showed a carbon efficiency of 72.3\% to ethylene and propylene.
   In addition, the process is designed and integrated in such a way that
   no external heat supply is required. A specific energy consumption (SEC)
   of 150 MJ/kg olefins (41 kWh/kg) has been estimated. A minimum selling
   price of 3.67 pound per kg of olefins is required for the proposed
   process to break-even. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the
   major cost driver is the cost of electricity. In addition, the life
   cycle assessment (LCA) has exposed that the proposed synthesis route of
   olefins has the potential to reduce the global warming potential (GWP)
   by 47\% compared to fossil- based production. The outcomes of this study
   can be beneficial to engineering conceptual studies, policy makers and
   contribute new information to the CCU academic community.},

Title = {Improving the Decision-Making for Sustainable Demolition Waste
   Management by Combining a Building Information Modelling-Based Life
   Cycle Sustainability Assessment Framework and Hybrid Multi-Criteria
   Decision-Aiding Approach},
Journal = {RECYCLING},
Year = {2024},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition
   waste management (DWM) from a life cycle thinking perspective. To this
   end, facilitating sustainability-oriented decision-making for DWM
   planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing
   the trade-offs among multifaceted criteria. This study develops a
   BIM-based DWM sustainability assessment approach to facilitate the life
   cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) and decision-making by
   integrating LCSA-related properties and hybrid Multi-Criteria
   Decision-Aiding (MCDA) methods into a BIM environment using Dynamo
   visual scripting. A dynamic linkage is developed in the streamlined
   BIM-based LCSA process, where the enriched Industry Foundation Class
   (IFC) models are coupled with custom LCSA data templates to achieve
   seamless data exchange between the BIM platform and external LCA tools.
   Subsequently, hybrid MCDA methods convert the assessment results into
   DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study verifies the applicability of the
   BIM-based framework. The results unveil that the sustainability score
   ascended with the recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the
   highest recycling rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63.
   Conversely, a DWM alternative reflecting the `status quo' in China's
   recycling industry has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower
   than the baseline scenario with a 50\% recycling rate. It is worth
   noting that the `growth curve' of the sustainability score continuously
   flattens as the target recycling rate escalates. The increment in
   recycling rate from the ``Australian standard{''} scenario to the
   optimal scenario is 18.4\%, whereas the sustainability score merely
   increases by 2.3\%, implying that the former scenario arrived at an
   optimum point for maximising the cost-efficiency of DWM under the
   predefined settings.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management
   (AEC/FM) industry is undergoing a digital transformation, and digital
   assets are emerging to support the development and delivery of physical
   assets. While these digital assets can create value throughout a
   project's life cycle and the form of digital assets has been previously
   studied, there is a dearth of research focused on how team processes
   must change to optimize the implementation of these digital tools.
   Therefore, the research objective was to characterize processes,
   enablers, and barriers related to digital asset development in AEC/FM
   projects. This paper implemented a systematic literature review of 73
   journal articles published through December 31, 2023. This work
   identified 13 processes, 19 enablers, and 20 barriers to developing and
   delivering digital assets to support physical assets throughout their
   life cycle. This work supports future research to enhance the AEC/FM
   industry's ability to leverage technology to support project delivery

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, many researchers across the world have addressed the
   implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the energy
   assessment of the built environment. However, several potential issues
   still need to be resolved in order to utilise the benefits provided by
   BIM to a maximum degree. To fill this gap, a systematic literature
   review is conducted in this study to critically investigate the
   utilisation of BIM tools in energy assessment. To achieve the
   above-mentioned objective, after shortlisting the relevant papers
   published hitherto, using keyword searching, a systematic review was
   undertaken, including the application of BIM in the contexts of
   different countries, types of BIM tools, BIM and Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) integration, energy affiliations, stakeholders' involvement and
   their roles, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis. The outcomes show
   the most widely used and effective BIM tools in different types of
   construction projects in various countries. The review of the literature
   clearly shows that BIM tools can effectively be used in the assessment
   of energy performance of buildings. The article gives insight to
   engineers, architecture, and decision makers to carefully select
   appropriate BIM tools in terms of energy assessment.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the spreadsheet and computer-aided mapping are the
   major tools for track alignment design. These traditional methods can
   meet the design criteria, but when the design factors and the change
   order must be satisfied at the same time, the process is always
   complicated and redundant. Building information modeling (BIM) is mainly
   applied on the generation and management of building data. It utilizes
   the object-oriented concept to increase the efficiency of information
   management in the building life cycle. The track-alignment data also
   have topographic relation that is similar to the building. There is a
   much closer relation between the topological, sharp, and position of
   track entities than that of the building components. This paper
   discusses the feasibility of applying a real-time, dynamic,
   three-dimensional building information model to design the alignment;
   compares the traditional alignment method with the BIM alignment method
   to find out the differences; and analyzes the precision by using
   alignment data of east and west main tracks of Qidu Switchyard of Taiwan
   Railways Administration. Moreover, the paper proves that the BIM can
   simplify track-alignment design, increases the abilities of
   computer-aided design and automation, and greatly shortens the design
   period. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000287. (C) 2011 American

Abstract = {Thermal building simulation based on BIM-models. Thermal energetic
   simulations are used for the estimation of the heating demand of
   buildings and districts. These simulations are based on building models
   containing geometrical and physical information. The creation of
   geometrical models is usually based on existing construction plans or in
   situ assessments which demand a comparatively big effort of
   investigation and modeling. Alterations, which are later applied to the
   structure, request manual changes of the related model, which increases
   the effort additionally. The physical model represents the total amount
   of parameters and boundary conditions that are influenced by material
   properties, location and environmental influences on the building. The
   link between both models is realized within the correspondent simulation
   software and is usually not transferable to other software products. By
   Applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) simulation data is stored
   consistently and an exchange to other software is enabled. Therefore a
   method which allows a thermal energetic simulation based on the exchange
   format Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) including an evaluation is
   presented. All geometrical and physical information are extracted
   directly from the building model that is kept up-to-date during its life
   cycle and transferred to the simulation. This accelerates the simulation
   process regarding the geometrical modeling and adjustments after later
   changes of the building. The developed method is based on simple
   conventions for the creation of the building model and ensures a
   complete transfer of all simulation data.},

Title = {Life cycle inherent toxicity: a novel LCA-based algorithm for evaluating
   chemical synthesis pathways},
Journal = {GREEN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3257-3264},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Green chemistry has long called for a life cycle approach in designing
   and assessing new syntheses. In evaluating hazardous chemical use, most
   green chemistry metrics only consider those chemicals directly
   associated with the synthesis and miss upstream hazards that can
   contribute to or even dominate overall impacts when evaluated using life
   cycle assessment (LCA). Conversely, LCA metrics are wholly dependent on
   emissions and do not capture potential risks posed by inherently
   hazardous chemicals. Life cycle inherent toxicity i{*} is a proposed
   novel metric that adapts the computational framework of LCA by attaching
   measures of inherent hazard to the intermediate chemical flows, rather
   than considering only emissions. Thus, it captures toxicity associated
   with the entire cradle-to-gate of a chemical, rather than just direct
   chemical inputs into a synthesis, and is a function of upstream use of
   hazardous chemicals, rather than only emissions. Values of i{*} are
   calculated for 181 organic chemicals from the ecoinvent LCI database.
   Statistical testing revealed no significant correlation between life
   cycle inherent toxicity and conventional toxicity, suggesting that the
   proposed metric provides novel information that can be used in
   conjunction with current green chemistry metrics. Outliers are
   investigated where the target chemical is much more toxic than its
   upstream building blocks (e.g., phosgene) and, conversely, where
   upstream chemical toxicity dominates (e.g., aniline). Values of i{*} are
   weakly correlated with values of conventional life cycle toxicity from
   the USEtox LCIA model, again suggesting that the new metric provides
   additional knowledge. A similar computational approach can be applied to
   examine other types of chemical hazards, such as corrosivity.},

Title = {An analysis to understand how the shape of a concrete residential
   building influences its embodied energy and embodied carbon},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The built environment is recognized as a major hotspot of resource use
   and environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been
   increasingly used to assess the environmental impacts of construction
   products and buildings and a new trend is characterized by the
   application of LCA to larger systems such as neighborhoods during early
   design phases. Assessing urban development projects at the master
   planning stage raises the issue of inventory data collection, especially
   for building materials which are reported to account for about 20\% of
   primary energy consumption in buildings, and up to 45\% of associated
   greenhouse gas emissions. Urban planners focus on the urban morphology
   and little information is known about the buildings characteristics
   apart from their general shape. This paper proposes a simplified model
   for the assessment of buildings embodied energy and embodied carbon in
   relation with urban planners' design levers. The model relies on the
   decomposition of buildings into functional elements in order to be
   sensitive to the shape of the buildings. A detailed sensitivity analysis
   and contribution analysis of the model is conducted on two types of
   generic building forms, in order to investigate the influence of
   parameters relating to shape on the embodied energy and embodied carbon
   of a building. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameters
   relating to shape (such as the dimension of the buildings) are more
   influential on the embodied energy and embodied carbon per square meter
   of building than the ones relating to the elements themselves (such as
   the wall thickness). The contribution analysis also brings evidence of
   the relation between the compactness factor and the embodied energy and
   embodied carbon of a building. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Life cycle management of energy-consuming products in companies using
   IO-LCA},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background, aim, and scope Today, the effective integration of life
   cycle thinking into existing business routines is argued to be the most
   critical step for more sustainable business models. The study tests the
   suitability of an input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) approach
   in screening life cycle impacts of energy-using products in companies.
   It estimates the life cycle impacts of three products and assesses the
   suitability of such approach in a company environment.
   Materials and methods The multiple case studies evaluate the suitability
   of an IO-LCA method in a company environment. A comprehensive life cycle
   cost and impact study of three product systems (building ventilation
   system, information and communication technology (ICT) network product,
   and welding machine) is conducted and the life cycle phases with highest
   economical and environmental contribution are determined. Scenario
   analysis is performed in order to assess the sensitivity of the results
   to major changes in the studied systems. Finally, the usability of the
   IO-LCA approach for environmental evaluations in companies is assessed
   by collecting data on workload and interviewing the participating
   workers and managers.
   Results The results showed that the use phase with operating energy was
   environmentally important in all evaluated energy-using products.
   However, only in one case (ICT network product) the use was the single
   most significant life cycle phase. In two other cases, the sourcing was
   equally important. The results also indicated that the IO-LCA approach
   is much easier to adapt by current management of companies because it
   automatically links life cycle costs to environmental indicators and, by
   order of magnitude, reduces the workload in companies.
   Discussion It appears that the IO-LCA approach can be used to screen
   environmentally significant life cycle phases of energy-using products
   in companies by utilizing readily available accounting or other
   documented data. The IO-LCA approach produced comparable results with
   the ones published in traditional process-based LCA literature. In
   addition to the main results, some practical benefits of using the
   IO-LCA could also be suggested: the approach was very fast to use and
   would thus allow an easier adoption of environmental evaluations in
   companies as well as wider environmental testing of products in early
   conceptual design phase.
   Conclusions The results indicated that the IO-LCA approach could clearly
   offer added value to the environmental management of companies. The
   IO-LCA was found to provide a very fast access to the key life cycle
   characteristics of products. Similarly, it offered practical means to
   integrate life cycle thinking into existing business routines and to
   activate the decision makers in companies by giving them easily
   comprehendible results.
   Recommendations and perspectives The results would suggest that similar
   environmental IO tables, besides the US ones used here, would have value
   and should be collected for other major geographical and economical
   regions. The tables would enable a much larger share of companies to
   manage their environmental issues. It also seems that, because the user
   profile is so dominant in the case of energy-using products, more
   studies, both theoretical (How to valuate the future behavior in
   environmental studies?) and empirical (What really creates value for
   users?), should focus on the behavior of users.},
