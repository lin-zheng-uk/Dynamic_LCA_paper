Title = {Autonomous, context-aware, adaptive Digital Twins-State of the art and
   roadmap},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Digital Twins are an important concept in the comprehensive digital
   representation of manufacturing assets, products, and other resources,
   comprising their design and configuration, state, and behaviour. Digital
   Twins provide information about and services based on their physical
   counterpart's current condi-tion, history and predicted future. They are
   the building blocks of a vision of future Digital Factories where
   stakeholders collaborate via the information Digital Twins provide about
   physical assets in the factory and throughout the product lifecycle.
   Digital Twins may also contribute to more flexible and resilient
   Dig-ital Factories. To achieve this, Digital Twins will need to evolve
   from today's expert-centric tools towards active entities which extend
   the capabilities of their physical counterparts. Required features
   include sensing and processing their environment and situation,
   pro-actively communicating with each other, taking decisions towards
   their own or cooperative goals, and adapting themselves and their
   physical counterparts to achieve those goals. Future Digital Twins will
   need to be context-aware, autonomous, and adaptive. This paper aims to
   establish a roadmap for this evolution. It sets the scene by proposing a
   working definition of Digital Twins and examines the state-of-the-art in
   the three topics in their relation to DTs. It then elaborates potentials
   for each topic mapped against the working definition, to finally
   iden-tify research gaps allowing for the definition of a roadmap towards
   the full realisation of autonomous, context-aware, adaptive Digital
   Twins as building blocks of tomorrow's Digital Factories. (c) 2021

   stress-strain-coping-support model},
Journal = {DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {36-43},
Abstract = {This article outlines the stress-strain-coping-support (SSCS) model
   which underpins the whole programme of work described in this
   supplement. The need for such a model is explained: previous models of
   substance misuse and the family have attributed dysfunction or
   deficiency to families or family members. In contrast, the SSCS model
   assumes that having a close relative with a substance misuse problem
   constitutes a form of stressful life circumstances, often longstanding,
   which puts affected family members at risk of experiencing strain in the
   form of physical and/or psychological ill-health. Coping and social
   support are the two other central building blocks of the model. Affected
   family members are viewed as ordinary people faced with the task of
   coping with such stressful life circumstances. It is an assumption of
   the model that, difficult though the coping task is, family members need
   not be powerless in maintaining their own health and helping their
   relatives. Good quality social support, in the form of emotional
   support, good information and material help, is an invaluable resource
   for affected family members, supporting their coping efforts and
   contributing positively to their health. The 5-Step Method, to be
   described later in the supplement, is based on the SSCS model. It can be
   seen as a way of increasing the positive social support available from
   professional sources.},

Title = {Managing information flow and design processes to reduce design risks in
   offsite construction projects},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-284},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Purpose Following the increasing need for faster construction, improved
   quality and evidence value propositions, offsite construction is
   increasingly being proffered as a viable contender to ``traditional{''}
   construction approaches. However, whilst evidence supports the move
   towards offsite, its uptake has been lower than expected. Whilst the
   precise reasons for this seem to be influenced by a number of issues,
   including contextual drivers and market maturity; some project
   stakeholders also view offsite as carrying greater risks. The purpose of
   this paper is to report on the quality of information flow, in
   particular, the impact and influence of this on design risks in offsite
   construction projects.
   Design/methodology/approach An existing design risk framework is used as
   the point of departure for this research. This is further expanded into
   a specific model for evaluating offsite construction projects design
   risks, the rubrics of which were informed by two case studies of offsite
   construction projects in Australia and the UK analysed with a
   process-tracing technique. Whilst these cases were geographically
   separated, the constructs were aligned to uncover fundamental design
   information requirements and concomitant risks associated with offsite.
   Findings The findings of the research reported in this paper include the
   crucial information feeding into the design process emanating from the
   lifecycle of offsite construction projects, namely, design, offsite
   (manufacturing), handling and transporting, site works and installation
   and also occupancy. These are contextualised within the four categories,
   namely, client requirements, project requirements, regulation aspects
   and social aspects and the final outcomes were summarised into a
   holistic diagram.
   Originality/value Given that the offsite construction has shifted the
   working paradigm into assigning a significant level of efforts and
   emphasis at the front end of the construction projects, the importance
   of its design process and hence design risks management has gone up
   significantly in construction projects delivered using this technique.
   This research and paper contributes significantly to the built
   environment domain by identifying the crucial aspects along the project
   lifecycle to be considered to minimise the potential occurrence of
   design risks and hence increasing the confidence of project stakeholders
   in adopting offsite construction techniques in their projects.},

Abstract = {Participants in online communities often enact different roles when
   participating in their communities. For example, some in cancer support
   communities specialize in providing disease-related information or
   socializing new members. This work clusters the behavioral patterns of
   users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles.
   Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, this
   research identified eleven roles that members occupy, such as welcomer
   and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics, including how roles
   change over members' lifecycles, and how roles predict long-term
   participation in the community. We found that members frequently change
   roles over their history, from ones that seek resources to ones offering
   help, while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's
   history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued
   participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for
   facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of
   community-building efforts.},

Abstract = {Building sustainability-aware software requires addressing
   sustainability early in the software development lifecycle. It can be
   ensured through Software Architecture (SA) evaluation for conformance to
   sustainability requirements. Typically, software sustainability needs to
   be assessed across four dimensions (4D): economic, environmental, social
   and technical. The current literature lacks information about
   4D-sustainability awareness of SA evaluation methods. In this paper, we
   present a systematic literature review to identify, categorize and
   characterize SA evaluation methods from 71 primary studies to ascertain
   their applicability for 4D-sustainability evaluation. Our results show
   that the majority of the methods are scenario-based, and provide support
   for technical sustainability but lack 4D-sustainability coverage. We
   conclude that extending the steps of an existing method for
   sustainability combined with metric-based modeling of 4D-sustainability
   QAs can aid in 4D-sustainability-aware SA evaluation. Also, continuous
   SA evaluation needs to be explored for the sustainability of SA over
   time.},

Abstract = {The recent manufacturing trend toward mass customization and further
   personalization of products requires factories to be smarter than ever
   before in order to: (1) quickly respond to customer requirements, (2)
   resiliently retool machinery and adjust operational parameters for
   unforeseen system failures and product quality problems, and (3)
   retrofit old systems with upcoming new technologies. Furthermore,
   product lifecycles are becoming shorter due to unbounded and
   unpredictable customer requirements, thereby requiring reconfigurable
   and versatile manufacturing systems that underpin the basic building
   blocks of smart factories. This study introduces a modular factory
   testbed, emphasizing transformability and modularity under a distributed
   shop-floor control architecture. The main technologies and methods,
   being developed and verified through the testbed, are presented from the
   four aspects of rapid factory transformation: self-layout recognition,
   rapid workstation and robot reprogramming, inter-layer information
   sharing, and configurable software for shop-floor monitoring.},

Abstract = {In the era of smart healthcare tremendous growth, plenty of smart
   devices facilitate cognitive computing for the purposes of lower cost,
   smarter diagnostic, etc. Android system has been widely used in the
   field of IoMT, and as the main operating system. However, Android
   malware is becoming one major security concern for healthcare, by the
   serious threat for our medical software assets, like the leakage of
   private information, the abusing of critical operations, etc.
   Unfortunately, the existing methods focus on building sustainable
   classification models, without fully considering system API which is the
   key to model aging. Compared to the traditional methods, we apply the
   lifeCycle of API as temporal metric. In addition to the temporal view,
   the ``sizes{''} of the APPs are utilized as spatial metric in the
   spatial view. Based on this, we firstly discuss the temporal and spatial
   metrics together in terms of clustering, and then propose our novel
   framework-TSDroid. In this framework, we use TS-based clustering
   algorithm to obtain clustering subsets to enhance the detection},

Title = {Process mining meets model learning: Discovering deterministic finite
   state automata from event logs for business process analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Within the process mining field, Deterministic Finite State Automata
   (DFAs) are largely employed as foundation mechanisms to perform formal
   reasoning tasks over the information contained in the event logs, such
   as conformance checking, compliance monitoring and cross-organization
   process analysis, just to name a few. To support the above use cases, in
   this paper, we investigate how to leverage Model Learning (ML)
   algorithms for the automated discovery of DFAs from event logs. DFAs can
   be used as a fundamental building block to support not only the
   development of process analysis techniques, but also the implementation
   of instruments to support other phases of the Business Process
   Management (BPM) lifecycle such as business process design and
   enactment. The quality of the discovered DFAs is assessed wrt customized
   definitions of fitness, precision, generalization, and a standard notion
   of DFA simplicity. Finally, we use these metrics to benchmark ML
   algorithms against real-life and synthetically generated datasets, with
   the aim of studying their performance and investigate their suitability
   to be used for the development of BPM tools.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Given the significant differences between discrete and process
   manufacturing industries, specific integration architectures are
   required to accommodate the unique characteristics of process
   industries. In this paper, an architecture that encompasses view models,
   flow models and O-O models is developed, which gradually specifies the
   evolving design details through successive lifecycle stages of process
   manufacturing systems. In the architecture, products are distinctly
   modelled to reflect the impact of product data and to facilitate the
   development of customized products. A combination of object and agent
   concepts is adopted for building the models of process manufacturing
   systems. System constituent elements are respectively modelled as two
   types of entities: namely the objects and agents. Objects are used to
   describe the passive constituent entities that possess no autonomy and
   conduct no functions, whereas agents are used to model the active
   entities that possess decision-making capabilities and perform
   operations on objects. One important advantage of the architecture is
   that it provides executable models at the implementation stage, which
   can be directly converted into application programs coded in
   object-oriented languages. Some models of the architecture are further
   discussed in depth and an information infrastructure based on CORBA
   standards is proposed for integrating the distributed data sources.},

Title = {The Importance of Creating a Reliability Network},
Booktitle = {2022 68TH ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM (RAMS 2022)},
Series = {Reliability and Maintainability Symposium},
Year = {2022},
Note = {68th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS), Tucson,
   AZ, JAN 24-27, 2022},
Abstract = {Two networks are important for reliability. There is a need to build a
   knowledge base covering reliability techniques and product awareness.
   There is also a need to grow and maintain a network of internal and
   external contacts.
   Many reliability tools and techniques are linked to one another. If the
   connections are not created and refreshed, opportunities will be lost
   for maximizing reliability. For example, technical risk, qualification,
   Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Reliability,
   Availability and Maintainability (RAM) analysis and life data analysis
   are all interlinked.
   Identifying technical risks at the start of product development or early
   in the project lifecycle is key to maximize the ability to address the
   risks. Knowing what is being changed or is novel will ensure actions can
   be completed so the changes will not negatively impact reliability.
   Applying appropriate effort to identify and mitigate risks through
   suitable qualification activities is possible if causes can be
   identified, by FMECA for example.
   RAM analysis is a useful tool to predict system performance. Developing
   RAM models in conjunction with FMECA allows the impact of failure to be
   documented and modelled correctly. Output from any RAM model is highly
   dependent on the quality of the inputs used. Capturing and analyzing
   actual product data for use in a RAM model is important. Revisiting a
   model over the operational life of a project as actual data becomes
   available allows validation of the model and the potential to address
   differences through refining the model inputs.
   Robust data capture, reporting and analysis of operational data is
   required to validate product and system performance. Reliability data
   from actual usage should be determined and used to reassess and verify
   earlier analysis and conclusions remain correct.
   As important as developing a network of tools, and arguably more
   critical, is the investment of effort into growing a network of people.
   Even with the advent of Big Data and the Internet of Things, knowing who
   can provide access to information is key. Also knowing and building
   trust with your sources and customers, internal and external to your
   organization, is essential. Building a robust relationship with the
   leadership team to ensure adequate resources are provided for
   reliability is essential.
   Continually pushing the boundaries of your network will help deliver
   robust products and systems by ensuring focus is given to reliability
   and the right information can be sourced.},

Title = {Design ontology for cognitive thread supporting traceability management
   in model-based systems engineering},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Industrial information integration engineering (IIIE) is an
   interdisciplinary field to facilitate the industrial information
   integration process. In the age of complex and large-scale systems,
   model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is widely adopted in industry to
   support IIIE. Traceability management is considered the foundation of
   information management in MBSE. However, a lack of integration between
   stakeholders, development processes, and models can decrease the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the system development. A modified MBSE
   toolchain prototype has been developed to implement traceability
   management; however, a lack of formal and structured specifications
   makes it difficult to describe the complex topology in traceability
   management scenarios using this MBSE toolchain, such as creating
   traceability between heterogeneous models, which leads to poor
   reusability of this MBSE toolchain in other traceability management
   scenarios. To formalize traceability management scenarios using the MBSE
   toolchain, a cognitive thread (CT) ontology is developed in this study.
   The CT ontology is a specification expressing the information of
   stakeholders, models, and development processes for traceability
   management, providing the cognition capability to analyze the
   interrelationships between them. Based on the implementation of the
   modified MBSE toolchain, the concepts and interrelationships in the CT
   ontology are identified. The CT ontology is designed to develop the MBSE
   toolchain prototype for building, managing, and analyzing traceability
   in various traceability management scenarios. A case study of an
   adaptive cruise control system design is used to evaluate the
   completeness of the CT ontology through qualitative and quantitative
   analyses. The results demonstrate that the proposed CT ontology
   formalizes the information related to traceability management while
   using the proposed MBSE toolchain and can also be used in common
   traceability management scenarios to design other complex engineered
   systems.},

Title = {Digital product data exchange in semantic service-oriented architecture},
Journal = {COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN

Volume = {28},

Pages = {1560-1578},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method of
   ontology-based digital product data exchange. The digital product data
   are enriched with virtual prototype (VP) model information and the
   designed exchange process is discussed. Additionally, an algorithm
   enabling the ontology-based data exchange method among missile guide
   systems is proposed and analyzed.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semantic sevice-oriented architecture
   (SSOA) is an innovative integration architecture for digital product
   information integration and process integration. In digital product
   ontology layer of SSOA, a new method of ontology-based product data
   exchange is proposed. Compared with traditional information exchange,
   the method adds the VP's information to general digital products'
   information. The VP's information is described by building VP static
   structure ontology and dynamic behavior ontology. The exchange process
   of the novel method is discussed in detail. Finally, an example
   illustrating the data exchange among missile guide systems is given and
   the merits of the proposed method is analyzed.
   Findings - Simulation information, especially VP information, is not
   always well defined and taken into account by product data exchange
   systems such as product data management or product lifecycle management.
   A formal description of VP information is often required in efficient
   and effective product data exchange. The goal is to define VP structure
   and behavior ontologies to enable ontology-based digital product data
   exchange.
   Originality/value - Using VP information including structure information
   and behavior information, the paper provides a new method of digital
   product data exchange.},

Abstract = {The power of artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with optimization
   algorithms can be linked to data-rich digital twin models to perform
   predictive analysis to make better informed decisions about installation
   operations and quality of life for the warfighters. In the current
   research, we developed AI connected lifecycle building information
   models through the creation of a data informed smart digital twin of one
   of US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) buildings as our test case.
   Digital twin (DT) technology involves creating a virtual representation
   of a physical entity. Digital twin is created by digitalizing data
   collected through sensors, powered by machine learning (ML) algorithms,
   and are continuously learning systems. The exponential advance in
   digital technologies enables facility spaces to be fully and richly
   modeled in three dimensions and can be brought together in virtual
   space. Coupled with advancement in reinforcement learning and computer
   graphics enables AI agents to learn visual navigation and interaction
   with objects. We have used Habitat AI 2.0 to train an embodied agent in
   immersive 3D photorealistic environment. The embodied agent interacts
   with a 3D environment by receiving RGB, depth and semantically segmented
   views of the environment and taking navigational actions and interacts
   with the objects in the 3D space. Instead of training the robots in
   physical world we are training embodied agents in simulated 3D space.
   While humans are superior at critical thinking, creativity, and managing
   people, whereas robots are superior at coping with harsh environments
   and performing highly repetitive work. Training robots in controlled
   simulated world is faster and can increase their surveillance,
   reliability, efficiency, and survivability in physical space.},

Abstract = {Our paperwork approaches the role played by the virtual organization
   (VO) as an instrument of digital economy, in the context of
   globalization paradigm. The VO is a specific tool and a chance for the
   development of emerging UE countries, like Romania, for capitalizing the
   market opportunities generated by more and more information and
   knowledge management policies employed by multinational organizations.
   The research we have conducted so far lead to identification of
   practical aspects of creating and managing the VO, both from structural
   and procedural perspective. The design and implementation of VOs imply
   changes of informational components, managerial structures and
   administrative entities. One solution to create and maintain virtual
   partnerships for stimulation of information production resides with
   intranet and extranet instruments. Informational reengineering consists
   of reviewing the architecture of informational flows, document content
   management, redesigning the data bases and data banks. We have noticed
   that with the VO, the processes of interrogating knowledge bases, mining
   data and multi-criteria analyses through specific instruments (data
   cubes, pivot tables, OLAP sequences etc.) become daily activities. From
   procedural perspective we have to focus on how the virtual organization
   grasps and reacts to its business environment. A VO has to dynamically
   adapt its place within this environment instead of building a certain
   position that it has to occupy for a while. A sustainable VO supposes a
   continuum of designing and implementing of economic processes
   fundamentally based on the information transfer, jointly knowledge
   creation, and building and sustaining of trust. Another part of our
   paper emphasizes the four stages of the lifecycle of the VO:
   identification, formation, operation and dissolution. The mechanisms of
   the VO were highlighted by adapting both a three layer model (modules
   universe, dynamic network, dynamic organization) and an integrated model
   (actors, members, and partners). Also, the information system for the VO
   has specific electronic management components for the informational
   content: electronic signature, digital certificate, and electronic
   workflows etc, which are analyzed in the third section of our paper. The
   virtual organization as a digital partner covers three application
   areas: knowledge management, resource planning and work management.
   Studying these areas in the fourth part of the paper has a great
   significance through the major implications on the existence and
   evolution of the real organizations (the support for the virtual ones),
   and also on the dynamics of their specific managerial and leadership
   techniques (section five of the paper). Also, the researches and
   practice in this field are of maximum importance nowadays: they are the
   fundament for building the Knowledge Based Economy.},

Abstract = {Language comprehension in everyday life requires the continuous
   integration of prior discourse context and general world knowledge with
   the current utterance or sentence. In the neurolinguistic literature,
   these so-called situation model building processes have been ascribed to
   the prefrontal cortex or to the right hemisphere. In this study, we use
   whole-head event-related fMRI to directly map the neural correlates of
   narrative comprehension in context. While being scanned using a
   spin-echo sequence, 20 participants listened to 32 short stories, half
   of which contained globally inconsistent information. The
   inconsistencies concerned either consistent temporal or chronological
   information or the emotional status of the protagonist. Hearing an
   inconsistent word elicited activation in the right anterior temporal
   lobe. The comparison of different information aspects revealed
   activation in the left precuneus and a bilateral frontoparietal network
   for chronological information. Emotional information elicited activation
   in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the extended amygdaloid
   complex. In addition, the integration of inconsistent emotional
   information engaged the dorsal frontomedial cortex (Brodmann's area
   8/9), whereas the integration of inconsistent temporal information
   required the lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. These results
   indicate that listening to stories can elicit activation reflecting
   content-specific processes. Furthermore, updating of the situation model
   is not a unitary process but it also depends on the particular
   requirements of the text. The right hemisphere contributes to language
   processing in context, but equally important are the left medial and
   bilateral prefrontal cortices.},

Title = {Likelihood of early contractor involvement (ECI) benefits in
   infrastructure versus building projects: the client's perception},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 21},
Abstract = {Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) is a feature that has been used in
   many construction projects to onboard contractor competence early in the
   project lifecycle. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
   testing whether ECI can also be useful for building projects. Following
   a systematic literature review approach, a comprehensive list of
   potential benefits of ECI was identified. This study utilizes empirical
   data collected from 91 respondents from three client organizations to
   explore the likelihood of these benefits in a project. In general, the
   results show that improved innovation, enhanced constructability, and
   greater collaboration are perceived to be the most likely benefits of
   ECI. The likelihood of ECI benefits is moderated by the type of project,
   with building projects more likely to benefit from ECI. Regarding job
   roles, project management professionals are the most optimistic about
   the likelihood of these benefits. The results also indicate that there
   is no significant difference in the likelihood of the benefits based on
   the respondents' experience with collaborative projects. However,
   respondents having prior experience with ECI have a different outlook
   than those without ECI experience for the better quality of solution and
   reduction in project cost dimensions.},

Title = {Developing a Secure Mobile Grid System through a UML Extension},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2333-2352},
Abstract = {The idea of developing software through systematic development processes
   to improve software quality is not new. Nevertheless, there are still
   many information systems such as those of Grid Computing which are not
   developed through methodologies that are adapted to their most
   differentiating features. A systematic development process for Grid
   systems that supports the participation of mobile nodes and incorporates
   security aspects into the entire software lifecycle will thus play a
   significant role in the development of systems based on Grid computing.
   We are creating a development process for the construction of
   information systems based on Grid Computing, which is highly dependent
   on mobile devices, in which security plays a highly important role. One
   of the activities in this process is that of analysis which is focused
   on ensuring that the system's security and functional requirements are
   elicited, specified and modelled. In our approach, this activity is
   driven by use cases and supported by the reusable repository. This
   obtains, builds, defines and refines the use cases of the secure Mobile
   Grid systems which represent the functional and non-functional
   requirements of this kind of systems. In this paper, we present the
   proposed development process through which we introduce the main aspects
   of the UML profile defined for building use case diagrams in the mobile
   Grid context through which it is possible to represent specific mobile
   Grid features and security aspects, showing in detail how to build use
   case diagrams for a real mobile Grid application by using our UML
   profile, denominated as GridUCSec-Profile.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We live in a technology driven era where each day new gadgets improve
   the way we live our lives. Many resources are being spent on building
   these devices that often turn obsolete overnight. Taking into account
   that these electronics have a long-term impact on the environment, a
   waste management system must be embedded in the electronic product
   lifecycle. In this paper, we propose a monitoring system for recycling
   batteries from electronic equipment and devices. This solution covers
   specific waste management issues to manage and reduce battery waste and
   to recover valuable materials and components. A solution for the
   continuous monitoring of each battery waste container is also proposed.
   The solution involves the storage of all information regarding the
   recycling process, such as pickup date and time, collector's name,
   quantity, and location. The research is also extended for smartphone
   usage. This is an important feature for collectors who need to access
   data in real time from any location. The mobile application directly
   reads the weight of battery waste, automatically saves the date and
   time, and stores the location along with any other useful information.},

Abstract = {Traditional quotation systems in most industries are paper-based system,
   which is expensive and time consuming. An economical secure and reliable
   system is required with the highest performance. This research is to
   reach a solution to expedite this process and aims to make a positive
   difference to the mechanical and manufacturing industry. A web-based
   database system has been created for ordering and generating
   non-standard 2D designs for flexible couplings via a series of
   predefined options and variable dimensional information. Flexible
   couplings measure output torque, transmit power, compensate for end
   movement and also protect equipment from overload. Evolutionary
   Prototyping Lifecycle Model - EPLM, Database Management systems - DBMS,
   and Client-Sever systems - CSS are implemented in this investigation. It
   is found that the system eliminated the attention of the drawing office
   for all couplings. The system would assist some industrial sales and
   engineering teams worldwide, by providing customers with up to date
   information and subsequently offering them the highest quality of
   service. It concluded that a reduction in lead-time (the amount of time,
   defined by the supplier that is required to meet a customer request or
   demand {[}5]) and engineering designs costs have been achieved from this
   investigation.},

Abstract = {In a software system's development lifecycle, engineers make numerous
   design decisions that subsequently cause architectural change in the
   system. Previous studies have shown that, more often than not, these
   architectural changes are unintentional by-products of continual
   software maintenance tasks. The result of inadvertent architectural
   changes is accumulation of technical debt and deterioration of software
   quality. Despite their important implications, there is a relative
   shortage of techniques, tools, and empirical studies pertaining to
   architectural design decisions. In this paper, we take a step toward
   addressing that scarcity by using the information in the issue and code
   repositories of open-source software systems to investigate the cause
   and frequency of such architectural design decisions. Furthermore,
   building on these results, we develop a predictive model that is able to
   identify the architectural significance of newly submitted issues,
   thereby helping engineers to prevent the adverse effects of
   architectural decay. The results of this study are based on the analysis
   of 21,062 issues affecting 301 versions of 5 large open-source systems
   for which the code changes and issues were publicly accessible.},

Title = {THE POST-OCCUPANCY DILEMMA IN GREEN-RATED BUILDINGS: A PERFORMANCE GAP
   ANALYSIS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {259-275},
Abstract = {The traditional construction industry has a significant and far-reaching
   impact on the environment, economy, and society. Green-certified
   buildings, with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design),
   BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment
   Method), DGNB (Deutsches Gutesiegel Nachhaltiges Bauen), or other
   certifications during the design stage, have great potential for
   increasing the effective use of resources and energy, reducing
   pollution, etc., and so their number has increased greatly in recent
   years. The post-occupancy evaluation (POE) of green buildings involves
   assessing whether they meet expected performance during the in-use phase
   and comprises four steps: (i) carrying out the research purpose/goal;
   (ii) determining the research objectives; (iii) conducting data
   collection, analysis, and visualization; and (iv) obtaining the results
   and drawing conclusions. However, there is a lack of reviews of POE
   research and analysis of reasons for actual performance gaps. In
   response and through a comprehensive literature review/analysis, this
   article summarizes the actual performance gaps of various
   green-certified projects, analyzes the reasons for failures, and
   proposes potential solutions. It is found that 74\%, 12\%, and 14\% of
   the projects perform better, similar, and worse, respectively, than
   their non-green counterparts. Future POE green building projects can be
   optimized from the perspective of the building, user, and POE system. To
   optimize green building actual performance, it is important to ensure
   the sufficient education of installation and maintenance personnel and
   occupants' green behavior, while interior design and decoration, the
   impact of user demographics, and POE performance indicators are key
   factors to be considered in green building design strategies and
   lifecycle evaluation systems.},

Title = {How to model and implement connections between physical and virtual
   models for digital twin application},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {B, SI},
Pages = {36-51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a virtual mirror (representation) of a physical
   world or a system along its lifecycle. As for a complex discrete
   manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or
   reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by
   giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real
   system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world
   system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing
   under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to
   effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex
   manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's
   lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some
   existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on
   the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the
   connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production
   system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach
   above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling
   theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally
   representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model,
   seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing
   entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been
   identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service
   cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second,
   for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection
   and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its
   virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With
   them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates
   input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are
   constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented
   digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data
   models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form
   a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated
   connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to
   demonstrate its practicality and usefulness.},

Title = {Using network motifs to characterize temporal network evolution leading
   to diffusion inhibition},
Journal = {SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Network motifs are patterns of over-represented node interactions in a
   network which have been previously used as building blocks to understand
   various aspects of the social networks. In this paper, we use motif
   patterns to characterize the information diffusion process in social
   networks. We study the lifecycle of information cascades to understand
   what leads to saturation of growth in terms of cascade reshares, thereby
   resulting in expiration, an event we call ``diffusion inhibition{''}. In
   an attempt to understand what causes inhibition, we use motifs to
   dissect the network obtained from information cascades coupled with
   traces of historical diffusion or social network links. Our main results
   follow from experiments on a dataset of cascades from the Weibo platform
   and the Flixster movie ratings. We observe the temporal counts of 5-node
   undirected motifs from the cascade temporal networks leading to the
   inhibition stage. Empirical evidences from the analysis lead us to
   conclude the following about stages preceding inhibition: (1)
   individuals tend to adopt information more from users they have known in
   the past through social networks or previous interactions thereby
   creating patterns containing triads more frequently than acyclic
   patterns with linear chains and (2) users need multiple exposures or
   rounds of social reinforcement for them to adopt an information and as a
   result information starts spreading slowly thereby leading to the death
   of the cascade. Following these observations, we use motif-based
   features to predict the edge cardinality of the network exhibited at the
   time of inhibition. We test features of motif patterns using regression
   models for both individual patterns and their combination and we find
   that motifs as features are better predictors of the future network
   organization than individual node centralities.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the use of integrated methods for the creation of
   three-dimensional models using laser scanning techniques, digital
   photogrammetry, 3D photomodelling and direct surveying. The
   three-dimensional models established using these methods constitute the
   basis for the construction of advanced information platform, able to
   represent the buildings under study with great accuracy at various
   scales, including both detailed elements and the monumental arrangement
   as a whole, as well as the textural features of the internal and
   external surfaces. The main aim of our studies is to enable the public
   to enjoy the results of archaeological and historical researches, via
   the web or stand-alone products, and to ``virtually visit{''} the
   monuments using RealTime 3D visiting systems. As well as showing the
   current state of the monuments, the visit includes reconstructions of
   previous phases in their history and examples of virtual restorations of
   the wall paintings. All the textures were obtained by processes of
   photomodelling and were applied to the geometrical forms in accordance
   with the radiosity algorithm, with lights and shadows of the `area'
   type. The result of this integrated approach is extremely life-like,

Abstract = {Accurate segmentation of infant hippocampus from Magnetic Resonance (MR)
   images is one of the key steps for the investigation of early brain
   development and neurological disorders. Since the manual delineation of
   anatomical structures is time-consuming and irreproducible, a number of
   automatic segmentation methods have been proposed, such as multi-atlas
   patch-based label fusion methods. However, the hippocampus during the
   first year of life undergoes dynamic appearance, tissue contrast and
   structural changes, which pose substantial challenges to the existing
   label fusion methods. In addition, most of the existing label fusion
   methods generally segment target images at each time-point
   independently, which is likely to result in inconsistent hippocampus
   segmentation results along different time-points. In this paper, we
   treat a longitudinal image sequence as a whole, and propose a
   spatial-temporal hypergraph based model to jointly segment infant
   hippocampi from all time-points. Specifically, in building the
   spatial-temporal hypergraph, (1) the atlas-to-target relationship and
   (2) the spatial/temporal neighborhood information within the target
   image sequence are encoded as two categories of hyperedges. Then, the
   infant hippocampus segmentation from the whole image sequence is
   formulated as a semi-supervised label propagation model using the
   proposed hypergraph. We evaluate our method in segmenting infant
   hippocampi from T1-weighted brain MR images acquired at the age of 2
   weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Experimental results
   demonstrate that, by leveraging spatial-temporal information, our method
   achieves better performance in both segmentation accuracy and
   consistency over the state-of-the-art multi-atlas label fusion methods.},

   bio-processes. Reasons for this situation can be found along the whole
   chain to set up and implement such approaches. In a time-consuming step,
   models are typically hand-crafted. Whether alternatives of better models
   exist to actually fulfill the final goals is undocumented, most often
   even unknown. In a next step, model-based process control methods are
   hand-coded in an error-prone procedure. For many of these methods given
   in the literature, only simulation studies are shown, leaving the
   interested reader with the unanswered question whether the
   implementation of a specific method in a real process is viable. As the
   potentially time-consuming implementation of such a method presents a
   risk for a rapid process development, promising candidates may be
   overlooked. To remediate this unsatisfactory situation, a combination of
   theoretical methods and information technology is proposed here. By an
   exemplarily realized software tool, it is shown how such an environment
   helps to promote model-based optimization, supervision, and control of
   bio-processes and allows for an inexpensive test of new ideas as well in
   real-life experiments. The contribution concentrates on an overview of a
   possible software architecture with respect to necessary methods and a
   meaningful information strategy, highlighting some of the more crucial
   building blocks. Experimental results exploiting parts of the proposed
   methods are given for a yeast strain synthesizing a product of
   industrial interest.},

Title = {Potential carbon emission reductions in australian construction systems
   through bioclimatic principles},
Journal = {Sustainable Cities and Society},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The building sector responsible for 40 per cent of energy use (UNEP SBCI
   Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative, 2010); by 2030, a total of
   60 Mt of carbon-reduction opportunities can be found in the Australian
   building sector (McKinsey, 2008). Reduction in the carbon emissions from
   Australian buildings is thus a priority for the Federal government. In
   Australia the government recently announced plan to cut emissions by
   26-28 per cent by 2030 (Federal Politics, 2015). This study concerns
   energy use in building construction and the degree of carbon emissions
   reduction that can be achieved through use of bioclimatic principles.
   Criteria of the model proposed in this research have been developed
   through analyzing bioclimatic principles to measure the potential
   construction carbon emissions that can be reduced in pre-construction
   and construction (cradle to site) stages during the lifecycle stages of
   a building. The developed model examines six case studies from Australia
   and the UK.
   The outcomes of this research clearly shows that by use of bioclimatic
   principles up to 65 per cent reduction in construction carbon emissions
   can be achieved for a whole building systems (floor, wall and roof),
   while current best construction practice (i.e. a graded by Green Star)
   at the highest level achieve less than 32 per cent reduction.
   However the future of the green construction industry lies on taking
   into account the bioclimatic principles- such as replacing conventional
   building materials with more energy efficient materials (i.e. replacing
   Portland cement with geopolymer based cement); reusing the recycled
   construction materials; reducing transportation and other similar
   initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A well-defined and flexible design chain reference model forms the basis
   for promoting collaborative design chain. The Special Interest Group
   under the Design Chain Council proposed the design chain operations
   reference (DCOR) in an attempt to assist enterprises building a design
   chain modeling frameworks. To date, DCOR version 1.0 only provides
   preliminary definitions, such as those for major design procedures, and
   lacks an example of best practices in the industry. Additionally, few
   studies have attempted this research issue. This study integrates the
   concepts of design chain, collaborative product design, and
   collaborative product commerce in a proposed collaborative design chain
   operations reference model (CDCORM) based on DCOR as a reference for
   developing a collaborative design chain system in the product lifecycle.
   The CDCORM consists of four hierarchical levels: collaborative design
   chain business model; collaborative design chain cooperative model;
   collaborative design-chain process model; and, a collaborative design
   chain operational model. Based on project management, the CDCORM has
   five core procedures-product plan, concept design, detail design, design
   review, and design amend. This study also assesses the effectiveness of
   the CDCORM by applying it to the motorcycle industry. In summary, this
   study extends the DCOR model and proposes a complete collaborative
   design chain reference model and implements a system in the motorcycle
   industry as a case study. This case study serves as a best practices
   example for the motorcycle industry.},

Abstract = {Traditional architectonic heritage elements are fragile and
   irreplaceable resources, signs of the ancient ways of life and the
   history of the modern societies, and essential valuable elements of the
   own landscape of a region. Accurate updated documentation might be the
   basis for any conservation or restoration intervention over
   architectonic heritage in order to ensure the conservation in its
   original appearance and in a collapse risk-free state, with the minimum
   intervention.
   This paper shows a multidisciplinary approach to heritage documentation
   involving close range photogrammetry and ground penetrating radar
   techniques, as well as the development of finite elements based
   structural models. Specifically this study is focused on the
   documentation of a mediaeval bridge concerning the geometric shape, the
   building material and the current damages and its causes. The usefulness
   of close range photogrammetry techniques in the accurate 3D modelling,
   cracks detection and mapping and exterior material characterization is
   analyzed. Further, a non-destructive test through GPR is employed for
   the interior material and zones description. For both techniques, the
   methodology followed for data collection and data processing aimed at
   minimisation of time consuming and optimisation of results is described
   in detail. Advantages and limitations of these techniques are displayed
   and the accuracy of the obtained results is also estimated. Resulting
   information related to the whole bridge geometry is taken as basis to
   develop a numerical analysis using the finite elements methods (FEM).
   Linear finite analysis provides useful information for diagnosis
   although non-linear methods should be used when the properties and
   geometry of the internal and external elements are well known.
   Photogrammetry provides the exact geometry needed to perform the FEM
   pre-process. Radar data provide approximate information about the
   different internal zones of the bridge. Finally, the FEM analysis leads
   to obtain a stress distribution compatible with the detected damages,
   allowing identifying its possible causes.
   Close range photogrammetry, ground penetrating radar techniques and the
   FEM analysis are proposed to perform a complete survey of the stability
   of the bridge and its accurate geometry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The development of an online game requires not only the content, visual
   and auditory design but also a considerable amount of effort for
   planning, creating and operating the infrastructure for exchanging
   information between players and backend. Within the context of building
   an own browser-based massively multiplayer online game, questions like
   how information of this kind can be exchanged arise. Within this paper,
   various strategies were planned, developed and evaluated to provide the
   helpful basis for a platform decision. These strategies do not feel very
   ``game-like{''}. As a result of this, we created an alternative approach
   as a runtime environment for games of this kind, which has to simplify
   the conventional strategies for making games: our GameEngine. This
   environment combines code generation for clients, automated data
   transformation, platform independent remote procedure calls and
   lifecycle management for entities. This paper targets to outline the
   different strategies for game realisation, and analyses the efforts in
   comparison to our approach in various applications. Proprietary
   TCP-based approaches are taken into account, as well as standardised web
   technologies and currently available runtime environments for game
   development. All approaches indicated a significant increase in effort
   for the implementation of various examples. An additional effort that
   can be nearly avoided, and is achieved with our approach.},

Abstract = {Building and information management techniques have significantly
   improved over the years. The need to improve the construction process in
   line with these improvements can therefore not be over emphasised.
   Traditionally, the industry has focussed solely on the functional
   (technical) performance of buildings, aesthetic values, time and cost
   requirements. Designers have failed in most cases to address the
   construction and fabrication problems and their implications for meeting
   clients' requirements. This has led to many problems in terms of
   litigation, extra cost and prolonged project duration. Although there
   has been significant research activity into buildability/
   constructibility, the underlying construction process has rarely been
   challenged. It is essential to use a component-based approach to
   construction, as is the case with the manufacturing sector.
   Specifically this research examines the implementation of hybrid
   concrete construction, which offers several alternatives to the client,
   consultant and contractor. Hitherto, performance of these alternatives
   during the construction process had only been assessed using traditional
   tools such as work-study, activity sampling and time studies. These
   methods, although effective in the evaluation of on-going construction
   activities, have been difficult to apply in the evaluation of the
   feasibility of a proposed construction. This is because they neither
   offer real time visualisation to the construction teams at the planning
   stages nor consider wholistic issues such as lifecycle costing, speed,
   fabrication, environmental impact and safety.
   As a result of these shortcomings, the application of virtual
   prototyping (VP) as a simulation tool is hereby proposed. This paper
   presents a conceptual methodology for selecting the most relevant
   criteria to hybrid concrete construction and also a conceptual VP model
   based on performance criteria established from literature review. The
   envisaged methodology should facilitate a means of developing a database
   for the proposed VP model. The paper concludes with a schematic
   description of the proposed overall development and future direction of
   the work.},

Abstract = {The globally complex trade practices have given rise to supply chain
   digitization for data storage and traceability of agricultural produce.
   However, these traceability systems suffer from issues such as
   scattering of information across multiple silos and susceptibility to
   erroneous or modified data which could lead to compromised food safety
   through fraud or counterfeiting. Ensuring the credibility of information
   about a product is another challenge as the available data may not be
   the true representation of the physical events in a product's lifecycle.
   Traceability and transparency come at the expense of sharing
   business-sensitive data. Exposure of product related data makes it
   difficult to protect trade secrets such as shipments, pricing and trade
   frequency while simultaneously ensuring the provenance/traceability to
   the consumers. In this paper, we highlight the need for agri-food supply
   chain traceability and present a generic framework for the traceability
   model with blockchain as a key component. The framework includes
   building blocks from data, storage, application and blockchain layers.
   Finally, we share our work in applying blockchain technology for supply
   chain management - with a focus on fresh produce as an example use-case.
   We also highlight the challenges and future opportunities in adopting
   blockchain for supply chain resilience.},

   technology, the emergence of extended reality (XR) has provided new
   ideas and options for sustainable construction (SC). Such technologies
   are applied in research and practice of the whole construction
   lifecycle, which can well meet the requirements of SC. This paper
   presents a critical review of XR applications in SC, aiming to
   systematically summarize the specific uses and advantages of virtual
   reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR)
   technologies. This study also examines the gap in research into the
   imbalance between the use of technology and the construction stages
   involved. Most XR applications focus on the preconstruction stage, while
   visualization and interactivity are the main features for further
   application. Through qualitative analyses, different applications of XR
   are introduced in stages throughout the entire lifecycle of building
   projects. In addition, the current challenges and limitations are
   presented, and several suggestions are proposed to facilitate further
   advancements in SC research and practice in the near future. This review
   provides valuable information to help stakeholders understand the
   advances in XR research and benefit future exploration and practice in
   the field.},

Abstract = {Design change (DC) which refers to any type of design or construction
   modification made once a contract is awarded is an important issue in
   today's construction. DCs usually would lead to an increase in the cost
   and time overrun of the project. It is thus important to manage them by
   using an effective management process. Various design change management
   processes (DCM) have been proposed by different research studies as well
   as different DCM processes are used in practice (real world). In
   addition, IT tools have an important role in the DCM process that could
   provide various functionalities to facilitate the DCM process. However,
   according to the scientific literature, there is still a need for
   improvement/offer of a collaborative platform in construction. This
   article aims to evaluate whether a platform, typically categorized as a
   PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) tool, is capable of meeting the
   collaboration requirements of DCM. 3DExperience is a cloud-based
   collaborative platform that is used in PLM-supported industry. This
   collaborative platform is a connected online environment where all the
   design, collaboration, and data management capabilities are stored in a
   single user interface. More precisely, this article investigates how PLM
   platform functionalities could address the needs of the DCM process in
   construction. By assessing the research findings of this article, it is
   demonstrated that PLM platforms have the potential to be utilized for
   DCM. Such an evaluation could lead to improved productivity in the DCM
   process within construction.},

Abstract = {3D point cloud data from sensing technologies such as 3D laser scanning
   and photogrammetry are able to capture the 3D surface geometries of
   target objects in an accurate and efficient manner. Due to these
   advantages, the construction industry has been capturing 3D point cloud
   data of construction sites, construction works, and construction
   equipment to enable better decision making in construction project
   management. The captured point cloud data are utilized to reconstruct 3D
   building models, check construction quality, monitor construction
   progress, improve construction safety etc. throughout the project
   lifecycle from design to construction and facilities management phase.
   This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art methods to acquire and
   process 3D point cloud data for construction applications. The different
   approaches to 3D point cloud data acquisition are reviewed and compared
   including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, videogrammetry, RGB-D
   camera, and stereo camera. Furthermore, the processing methods of 3D
   point cloud data are reviewed according to the four common processing
   procedures including (1) data cleansing, (2) data registration, (3) data
   segmentation, and (4) object recognition. For each processing procedure,
   the different processing methods and algorithms are compared and
   discussed in detail, which provides a useful guidance to both
   researchers and industry practitioners for adopting point cloud data in
   the construction industry.},

Title = {Quality of Big Data in health care},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Pages = {621+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The current trend in Big Data analytics and in particular
   health information technology is toward building sophisticated models,
   methods and tools for business, operational and clinical intelligence.
   However, the critical issue of data quality required for these models is
   not getting the attention it deserves. The purpose of this paper is to
   highlight the issues of data quality in the context of Big Data health
   care analytics.
   Design/methodology/approach - The insights presented in this paper are
   the results of analytics work that was done in different organizations
   on a variety of health data sets. The data sets include Medicare and
   Medicaid claims, provider enrollment data sets from both public and
   private sources, electronic health records from regional health centers
   accessed through partnerships with health care claims processing
   entities under health privacy protected guidelines.
   Findings - Assessment of data quality in health care has to consider:
   first, the entire lifecycle of health data; second, problems arising
   from errors and inaccuracies in the data itself; third, the source(s)
   and the pedigree of the data; and fourth, how the underlying purpose of
   data collection impact the analytic processing and knowledge expected to
   be derived. Automation in the form of data handling, storage, entry and
   processing technologies is to be viewed as a double-edged sword. At one
   level, automation can be a good solution, while at another level it can
   create a different set of data quality issues. Implementation of health
   care analytics with Big Data is enabled by a road map that addresses the
   organizational and technological aspects of data quality assurance.
   Practical implications - The value derived from the use of analytics
   should be the primary determinant of data quality. Based on this
   premise, health care enterprises embracing Big Data should have a road
   map for a systematic approach to data quality. Health care data quality
   problems can be so very specific that organizations might have to build
   their own custom software or data quality rule engines.
   Originality/value - Today, data quality issues are diagnosed and
   addressed in a piece-meal fashion. The authors recommend a data
   lifecycle approach and provide a road map, that is more appropriate with
   the dimensions of Big Data and fits different stages in the analytical
   workflow.},

Title = {A study on the adaptive approach to technology-driven enhancement of
   multi-scenario business processes},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {118-146},
Abstract = {Purpose Process-oriented organizations are compelled to be innovative
   and continuously implement changes to meet customer requirements and
   gain a competitive advantage in accordance with the business process
   management approach. In the digital age, organizations develop business
   process support systems using agile methods and introduce adaptation
   skills in order to support their core business. Seamlessly integrating
   both practices into a coherent and practically applicable solution
   supporting multi-scenario processes infallibly remains a challenge. The
   paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach The workshops identifying the key issues in
   an international capital group that consolidates facility management
   companies, as well as a related research review, have fueled a
   two-cycled Canonical Action Research (CAR) study.
   Findings The paper extends the current understanding of IT-enabled
   agility, proposing an adaptively improved infrastructure with a catalog
   of digital options that facilitates the composition of multi-scenario
   business processes.
   Research limitations/implications The CAR was limited to the members of
   management board and the managers constituting the focus groups. The
   agile business process management (ABPM) model proposed focuses on
   adding novel functionalities/building new processes, leaving
   functionality lifecycle out-of-scope. ABPM empirical validation is
   limited to a single business/technical case.
   Practical implications Real-life solution for supporting dynamic
   business processes was delivered, as rigid IT solutions do not support
   quick assembly of customized business processes with abundant number of
   scenarios. The infrastructure enables composition of customer-tailored
   services based on re-usable digital options directory as well as
   enhances business process discrepancies/software bugs detection,
   reducing the cost of maintaining IT infrastructure for entire customer
   portfolio. A number of issues resulting from building IT solutions
   within a series of isolated projects with no coherent overall
   development strategy are mitigated.
   Originality/value The ABPM acts as a reference model for focusing on
   developing critical functionalities and limiting resources consumed by
   redundant features.},

Title = {NetEye: a user-centered wireless sensor network testbed for
   high-fidelity, robust experimentation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1213-1229},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Experimentation infrastructures for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have
   been widely adopted over the past decade for high-fidelity validation
   and rapid prototyping of applications and for discovering and modeling
   phenomena that have led to improvements in analysis and simulation
   capabilities. Nonetheless, the community is still looking for more
   heterogeneous WSN testbeds for purposes such as federation, experiment
   regression analysis, and improved testbed availability. In addition,
   most existing WSN testbeds lack robustness and predictability in the
   presence of failures, and they do not provide user-friendly support for
   scientific experimentation (e.g., quick repetition of experiments). We
   develop the NetEye testbed as a high-fidelity, robust WSN
   experimentation infrastructure that provides the ease of scientific
   experimentation. Consisting of 130 TelosB motes with IEEE 802.15.4
   radios and 15 Linux laptops with IEEE 802.11a/b/g radios, NetEye
   provides a WSN deployment that enables high-fidelity experimentation
   with single-hop as well as multihop WSN networking, and the lab-scale
   deployment mimics network properties of building-scale and outdoor WSN
   deployments. Building upon the authors experience in developing and
   using WSN testbeds in the past years, NetEye also has enhanced features
   that enables easy, robust scientific experimentation. In particular,
   NetEye provides users with a simple, powerful web portal, which
   streamlines users experience in the whole lifecycle of scientific
   experimentation (e.g., experiment scheduling, status monitoring, and
   data exfiltration). NetEye employs a stable, fault-tolerant state
   machine to improve the robustness of the testbed in the presence of
   failures. NetEye also develops a health monitoring service NetEye Doctor
   that monitors hardware and software status; the real-time health
   monitoring information about the testbed is seamlessly integrated with
   the lifecycle of experiment scheduling, experiment status monitoring,
   and experiment data analysis for both robust experimentation and for
   informed experiment analysis. To address the log-data congestion problem
   in long-running, large scale experiments, NetEye employs a TDMA (Time
   Division Multiple Access) mechanism to ensure reliability in
   exfiltrating experiment data to users. To facilitate quick, repetitive
   scientific experimentation, NetEye also speeds up the mote programming
   cycle through fast job status transition and multi-thread-based mote
   programming. NetEye has been successfully running for over 3.5?years,
   and it has been integrated with the federated WSN experimental
   infrastructure KanseiGenie. NetEye is widely used by researchers from
   USA and Asia, and more than 10 experiments are executed through NetEye
   per day on average. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Background and evaluation design of a community-based health-promoting
   school intervention: Fit Lifestyle at School and at Home (FLASH)},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundA community-based approach can be a promising strategy for
   implementing school-based health promotion aimed at stimulating healthy
   physical activity and dietary behaviour. Such an approach builds on the
   community capacity of multiple stakeholders, empowering them to design
   and implement tailored activities, supported by the whole school
   community. This paper describes the background and evaluation design of
   the community-based school intervention Fit Lifestyle at School and at
   Home' (FLASH) in four prevocational schools. FLASH includes four
   strategies for building the community capacity of students, school
   personnel and parents: 1) identifying leaders in each stakeholder group,
   2) stimulating a school culture of participation, 3) having stakeholders
   design and implement tailored activities and 4) creating a network of
   local partners for structural embedding. The objective is to monitor the
   capacity-building processes of the FLASH intervention and to explore if
   these processes contribute to changes in community capacity. In
   addition, we will explore if the FLASH intervention is related to
   changes in PA, dietary behaviours and BMI of students.MethodsThis study
   has a mixed methods design and uses a participatory action-oriented
   approach to monitor and evaluate changes in community capacity, tailored
   health-promotion activities and implementation processes. Methods
   include semi-structured interviews, focus groups, journals, document
   analysis and observational scans of the physical environment. In
   addition, changes in BMI, physical activity and dietary behaviours of
   prevocational students will be explored by comparing the four
   intervention schools to four control schools. Data are collected by
   questionnaires and anthropometric measurements.DiscussionThe main
   strength of this study is its use of mixed methods to evaluate real-life
   processes of creating a healthy-school community. This will provide
   valuable information on capacity-building strategies for the structural
   embedding of health-promotion activities within school settings. The
   results could help schools become more empowered to adapt and adopt
   integral health-promotion interventions in daily practice that suit the
   needs of their communities, that are expected to be sustainable and that
   could lead to favourable changes in the PA and dietary behaviour of
   students.Trial registrationISRCTN67201841; date registered: 09-05-2019,

Title = {How to generate more value from hydrocarbon resources},
Journal = {OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {136-140},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the next decade, the E\&P industry will witness a revolution in the
   development and management of hydrocarbon assets. The integration of
   time-lapse seismic, subsurface modeling, dynamic reservoir simulation,
   smart wells and production facilities will yield significant
   improvements in recovery and productivity as well as a reduction in the
   environmental impact of oil and gas developments. Increasingly fields
   will become ``Smart{''}.
   ``Smartness{''} involves the systematic application and integration of
   control engineering and IT concepts to oil- and gasfield management. By
   combining data gathering, integrated modeling and control elements in
   so-called ``value loops{''}, optimization opportunities are created in
   every phase of the resource lifecycle. Different data sources may be
   combined to reduce uncertainties in reservoir models. Reservoir
   management may be improved by controlling individual zones in wells,
   acting on down-hole flow and pressure information. Another element of
   ``smartness{''} is introduced when in future the transport, separation
   and processing of well fluids can take place at surface, on the seabed
   or down-hole. This creates additional development options and
   flexibility. The paper proposes a conceptual framework for the
   understanding and design of E\&P ``smartness{''}. It covers the
   fundamental elements of smart developments and discusses Shell case
   studies and projects to show the value of using Smart Well and Field
   technology. Shell's approach to building an industry leading Smart
   Fields capability and stimulating the development of key technologies is
   discussed.},

Title = {Digital twin for decarbonizing operating buildings: A systematic review
   and implementation framework development},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {320},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology presents a transformative approach to
   retrofitting practices, with the potential of decarbonizing operating
   buildings (DOBs) by up to 30 \%. However, the fragmented nature of the
   extensive International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   guidelines for carbon assessment and the complexity of DT systems,
   hinder practitioners' efforts to fully realize DT's potential in
   achieving the 2050 zero-emission target for operating buildings. This is
   evident in the continuous increase in operational carbon emissions from
   buildings, which reached an all-time high of 10 gigatonnes (GtCO2) in
   2022, and the mere 13 \% global adoption rate of DT in building
   retrofitting. The aim of this review study is to develop a DT-driven
   Decarbonization Framework for Operating Buildings (DT-DeFOB) - a pathway
   for cohesive implementation of complex DT systems for DOBs. Using the
   inclusion and exclusion method, 243 relevant studies from 2018 to 2023
   were selected for scientometrics mapping and systematic literature
   review (SLR). Furthermore, 20 ISO guidelines were selected for
   comprehensive document analysis. The findings indicated a growing
   trajectory in DT literature; however, a limited definitive trend in its
   effectiveness for DOB was evident. The SLR highlighted a lack of dynamic
   carbon criteria tailored for operating buildings, as well as a notable
   absence of a cohesive pathway for implementing multifaceted DT systems
   in DOBs. Hence, the critical components of DT-DeFOB were established,
   including a Dynamic Operational Carbon Reduction Guide (DOCReG) - a
   crucial component of DT-DeFOB developed via document analysis of the 20
   selected ISO, Technology Interconnections, Human Engagement, Data
   Integration, and Lifecycle Management. DT-DeFOB provides a pioneering
   blueprint to help achieve the construction sector's 2050 net-zero carbon
   target, presenting a ground-breaking approach for impactful climate
   change mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin Technology has taken the place in top 10 strategic
   technology trends in 2017 termed by Gartner Inc. Digital Twin concept
   brings out the virtual depiction or the digital representation of the
   real world equipment, device or system whereas the real world and the
   virtual world gets the highest synchronization. The digital
   representation of the complete life cycle of a product from its design
   phase to the maintenance phase will give the prophetic analysis of the
   problems to the business. This greatest advantage of foreseeing problems
   in the development of a device will give early warnings, foil downtime,
   cultivate novel prospects and inventing enhanced devices or gadgets for
   the later use at the lesser expense by means of digital representations.
   Indeed, these will devise a larger influence on conveying superior
   consumer feeling also in the enterprise. The emerging trends such as
   Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Internet of
   Things and Big Data used in Industry 4.0 play a vital role in Digital
   Twin and they are mostly adopted in the world of manufacturing,
   Industrial Internet of Things, and automobile business world. The
   penetration, wide coverage and the advancement of the Internet of Things
   in real-world have elevated the power of Digital Twins more economical
   and reachable for the world of various businesses.
   1. Manufacturing: Digital Twin has brought out the change in the
   existing manner of the manufacturing segment. Digital Twins have a
   substantial influence on the design of products and their manufacturing
   and maintenance. Because of its influence the manufacturing more
   competent and augmented while dropping throughput times.
   2. Industrial IoT: Integrating digital twin with industrial firms will
   facilitate the activities such as monitoring, tracking and controlling
   industrial systems in digital means. We can potentially experience the
   power of digital twin since it captures environmental data such as
   locality, settings of the devices, financial frameworks, etc., other
   than the operational data, which benefits in foreseeing the forthcoming
   operations and incongruities.
   3. Healthcare: Since the healthcare sector demands higher accuracy in
   diagnosis and treatment, with the important data from IoT, digital twins
   can play a vital role by reducing the expense for the patient,
   precautionary alerts to avoid health deterioration and giving tailored
   health support system. This will be great support especially in
   developing countries like India.
   4. Smart cities: Digital Twin coupled with IoT data can augment the
   efficient planning of the smart city and execution of its building by
   supplementing financial progress, effectual administration of resources,
   lessening of environmental impression and escalate the complete worth of
   a resident's life. The digital twin prototypical can aid city organizers
   and legislators in the smart city planning by retrieving the visions
   from numerous sensor networks and smart systems. The information
   received from the digital twins supports them in reaching well-versed
   choices concerning the future as well.
   5. Automobile: Automobile industry can get voluminous benefits out of
   Digital Twins for producing the simulated framework of a coupled
   vehicle. It retrieves the behavioral and functional information of the
   vehicle and services in examining the inclusive performance efficiency
   of the vehicle as well as the features connected along with it. Digital
   Twin also supports in supplying a justly enhance support and service for
   the consumers.
   6. Retail: Alluring client satisfaction is a fundamental factor in the
   merchandising world. Digital twin employment can play a key role in
   supplementing the retail customer experience by forming virtual twins
   for customers and modeling fashions for them on it. Digital Twins also
   supports enhanced planning of stock maintenance, safekeeping procedures,
   and human resource administration in an augmented means.
   The word `digital twin' was, to begin with, devised in item development
   administration in 2003 when computerized illustrations of physical items
   were still in their infancy. With the development of computational power
   and the devices intertwined with the Internet, Digital Twins are
   presently picking up footing over businesses of various fields. They
   were as of late named one of the greatest 10 significant innovation
   patterns in 2018 by Gartner.},

Title = {A critical review of the developments in building adaptability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {284-303},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper provides a critical review of developments in the
   adaptability of buildings. The purpose of this paper is to determine the
   current ``state-of-the-art{''}, describe current thinking and trends in
   research and practice, and identify issues and gaps that further
   research can address. It provides a basis for a scientific and practical
   understanding of the interdependencies across different design
   criterion. This paper increases the awareness of architects, engineers,
   clients and users on the importance of adaptability and its role in
   lowering impacts over the lifecycle of buildings as part of the
   infrastructure system.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws mainly from the
   literature as its source of evidence. These were identified from
   established databases and search engines (e.g. Scopus, ISI Web of
   Knowledge and Google Scholar) using keywords such as adaptability,
   adaptable, adaptation, and flexibility. Over 80 sources including books,
   journal papers, conference proceedings, research reports and doctoral
   theses covering the period 1990 to 2017 were reviewed and categorised.
   An inductive approach was used to critically review and categorise these
   publications and develop a framework for analysis.
   Findings - The concept of adaptability includes many dimensions which
   can broadly fall into two categories: changes to buildings and user
   adaptations to buildings. However, previous research has mostly focussed
   on the former, with many attempts to identify building attributes that
   facilitate adaptability, and some considerations for its assessment. Key
   areas that have not been adequately addressed and which require further
   research include: user/occupant adaptations, cost, benefits and
   implications of various adaptability measures, and the development of a
   standardised assessment methodology that could aid in decision making in
   the design stage of buildings.
   Research limitations/implications - The adaptability strategies
   considered in this review focussed mainly on building components and
   systems, and did not include the contribution of intelligent and
   smart/biological systems. The coverage is further limited in scope due
   to the period considered (1990-2017) and the exclusion of terms such as
   ``retrofit{''} and ``refurbishment{''} from the review. However, the
   findings provide a solid basis for further research in the areas
   identified above. It identifies research issues and gaps in knowledge
   between the defined needs and current state-of-the-art on adaptive
   building for both research and practice.
   Originality/value - This paper is a review of research into a highly
   topical subject, given the acknowledged need to adapt buildings over
   their lifecycle to environmental, economic or social changes. It
   provides further insights on the dimensions of adaptability and
   identifies areas for further research that will contribute to the
   development of robust tools for the assessment of building adaptability,
   which will enhance the decision-making process of building design and
   the development of a more sustainable built environment.},

Abstract = {Landslide is the most dangerous type of natural hazard, with devastating
   consequences for human life and the economy as a whole. Landslides have
   become an essential responsibility to decrease their harmful
   consequences, which involves analyzing landslide-related information and
   anticipating prospective landslides. In this proposed work, the
   landslide susceptibility zones and the triggering factors were analyzed
   and classified using a deep neural network (DNNs). A geographical
   database is created in this study based on 2018 landslide potential
   points in Kerala, India. 13 districts and 10 parameters are used to
   create the geographic database: polygon length, polygon width, polygon
   area, buildings, roads, agricultural data, land use, land cover,
   longitude, and latitude. A DNN model is generated using fine-tuned
   parameter with 4728 historic landslide points. This proposed work
   predominantly concentrates on the experimental aspect, particularly the
   DNN architecture model has employed for training the dataset. This
   design employs the adamax optimizer, tanh as an activation function, and
   four hidden layers with a learning rate of 0.01 to get the highest
   accuracy with the minimum loss. We found 98.16\% as the maximum accuracy
   after numerous testing operations, implying that the landslide in Kerala
   was primarily caused by debris flow.},

Abstract = {Rising floodwaters in the Blue Nile (BN) and White Nile (WN) tributaries
   continually affects people's lives and the safety of infrastructures in
   Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Recently, floods have covered a wide
   area of Khartoum and destroyed many buildings and bridges. We conducted
   this study to evaluate and predict the flood effects around BN and WN in
   Khartoum to make recommendations in view of upcoming flood disasters.
   Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes after floods that occurred in 2014,
   2016, and 2020 were evaluated and LULC was predicted for 2024 by
   applying a combination of remote sensing (RS) and geographic
   information-system (GIS) techniques. We also evaluated the expected
   hazard due to floods. Our results showed that the agricultural,
   built-up, and water changes around BN were 0.30\%, 0.25\%, and 0.05\%,
   respectively, for the period 2014-2016, and, that changes for the period
   2016-2020 were 3.38\%, 3.68\%, and 7.28\%, respectively.
   Correspondingly, the agricultural, built-up, and water changes around WN
   were 5.56\%, 3.26\%, and 8.02\% during 2014-2016 and 13.79\%, 5.62\%,
   and 21.40\% during 2016-2020. The change estimation indicates that the
   most flood effects in the region occurred around WN, possibly covering

Title = {What Impact Does Training Have on Employment Stability?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1257-1265},
Abstract = {As consequence of constant changes and rapid expiration of knowledge
   that occur at all levels of the current information society, the
   education, training and selection of a profession is not a single
   decision for life which ends accessing at the first job, but a
   continuous process too. People who are seeking education and training
   try to take advantage of maximum benefit of their formation. In this
   context the aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence of the
   effects of continuous training on Employment Stability in the Spanish
   labor market. The dependent variable includes two situations of the
   active workers: continuous and discontinuous employability. To
   distinguish between them an Employability Index Stability was calculated
   taking into account two factors: employed time and job security. The
   data obtained from a survey of a nationwide sample of 918 employed
   individuals has been analysed through a binary logit model. The
   coefficients estimated have revealed a positive and significant
   relationship between the probability of employment stability and
   continuous vocational training received. The results obtained in this
   study showed that the whole process of education of people influences
   the career choices and work-life. So it is important to redefine the
   role of educators and trainers, and adapt new teaching-learning methods
   to promote awareness and capacity building and skills that enable
   workers to enter and stay in a new working environment conditioned by
   important changes in techniques of education and economic and social
   systems.},

Title = {Building Automation Pipeline for Diagnostic Classification of Sporadic

Journal = {DIAGNOSTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The microscopic diagnostic differentiation of odontogenic cysts from
   other cysts is intricate and may cause perplexity for both clinicians
   and pathologists. Of particular interest is the odontogenic keratocyst
   (OKC), a developmental cyst with unique histopathological and clinical
   characteristics. Nevertheless, what distinguishes this cyst is its
   aggressive nature and high tendency for recurrence. Clinicians encounter
   challenges in dealing with this frequently encountered jaw lesion, as
   there is no consensus on surgical treatment. Therefore, the accurate and
   early diagnosis of such cysts will benefit clinicians in terms of
   treatment management and spare subjects from the mental agony of
   suffering from aggressive OKCs, which impact their quality of life. The
   objective of this research is to develop an automated OKC diagnostic
   system that can function as a decision support tool for pathologists,
   whether they are working locally or remotely. This system will provide
   them with additional data and insights to enhance their decision-making
   abilities. This research aims to provide an automation pipeline to
   classify whole-slide images of OKCs and non-keratocysts (non-KCs:
   dentigerous and radicular cysts). OKC diagnosis and prognosis using the
   histopathological analysis of tissues using whole-slide images (WSIs)
   with a deep-learning approach is an emerging research area. WSIs have
   the unique advantage of magnifying tissues with high resolution without
   losing information. The contribution of this research is a novel,
   deep-learning-based, and efficient algorithm that reduces the trainable
   parameters and, in turn, the memory footprint. This is achieved using
   principal component analysis (PCA) and the ReliefF feature selection
   algorithm (ReliefF) in a convolutional neural network (CNN) named
   P-C-ReliefF. The proposed model reduces the trainable parameters
   compared to standard CNN, achieving 97\% classification accuracy.},

Title = {6-month-olds are sensitive to English morphology},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Each language has its unique way to mark grammatical information such as
   gender, number and tense. For example, English marks number and
   tense/aspect information with morphological suffixes (e.g., -s or -ed).
   These morphological suffixes are crucial for language acquisition as
   they are the basic building blocks of syntax, encode relationships, and
   convey meaning. Previous research shows that English-learning infants
   recognize morphological suffixes attached to nonce words by the end of
   the first year, although even 8-month-olds recognize them when they are
   attached to known words. These results support an acquisition trajectory
   where discovery of meaning guides infants' acquisition of morphological
   suffixes. In this paper, we re-evaluated English-learning infants'
   knowledge of morphological suffixes in the first year of life. We found
   that 6-month-olds successfully segmented nonce words suffixed with -s,
   -ing, -ed and a pseudo-morpheme -sh. Additionally, they related nonce
   words suffixed with -s, but not -ing, -ed or a pseudo-morpheme -sh and
   stems. By 8-months, infants were also able to relate nonce words
   suffixed with -ing and stems. Our results show that infants demonstrate
   knowledge of morphological relatedness from the earliest stages of
   acquisition. They do so even in the absence of access to meaning. Based
   on these results, we argue for a developmental timeline where the
   acquisition of morphology is, at least, concurrent with the acquisition
   of phonology and meaning.},

Title = {PoseidonDecision Support Tool for Water Reuse},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In an era when many water systems worldwide are experiencing water
   stress regarding water quantity and quality, water reuse has received
   growing attention as one of the most promising integrated mitigating
   solutions. Nevertheless, the plethora of technologies and their
   combinations available, as well as social, economic, and environmental
   constraints, often make it complex for stakeholders and especially
   decision makers to elicit relevant information. The scope of the current
   study is to develop a decision support tool that supports
   pre-feasibility studies and aims at promoting water reuse and building
   capacities in the field. The tool developed currently encompasses 37
   unit processes combined into 70 benchmark treatment trains. It also
   contains information on water quality standards and typical wastewater
   qualities. It estimates the removal performances for 12 parameters and
   the lifecycle costs including distribution. The tool and all underlying
   data are open access and under continuous development. The underlying
   systemic approach of the tool makes it intuitive also for users with
   limited prior knowledge in the field to identify most adequate solutions
   based on a multi-criteria assessment. This should help to promote water
   reuse and spearhead initiates for more detailed feasibility and design
   commissioning for implementation of water reuse schemes.},

Title = {Fast and curious: A model for building efficient monitoring- and
   decision-making frameworks based on quantitative data},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {132},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context: Nowadays, the hype around artificial intelligence is at its
   absolute peak. Large amounts of data are collected every second of the
   day and a variety of tools exists to enable easy analysis of data. In
   practice, however, making meaningful use of it is way more challenging.
   For instance, affected stakeholders often struggle to specify their
   information needs and to interpret the results of such analyses.
   Objective: In this study we investigate how to enable continuous
   monitoring of information needs, and the generation of knowledge and
   insights for various stakeholders involved in the lifecycle of
   software-intensive products. The overarching goal is to support their
   decision making by providing relevant insights related to their area of
   responsibility.
   Methods: We implement multiple monitoringand decision-making frameworks
   for six individual, real-world cases selected from three different
   platforms and covering four types of stakeholders. We compare the
   individual procedures to derive a generic process for instantiating such
   frameworks as well as a model to scale it up for multiple stakeholders.
   Results: For one, we discovered that information needs of stakeholders
   are often related to a limited subset of data sources and should be
   specified in stages. For another, stakeholders often benefit from
   sharing and reusing existing components among themselves in later
   phases. Specifically, we identify three types of reuse: (1) Data and
   knowledge, (2) tools and methods, and (3) concepts. As a result, key
   aspects of our model are iterative feedback and specification cycles as
   well as the reuse of appropriate components to speed up the
   instantiation process and maximize the efficiency of the model.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that knowledge and insights can be
   generated much faster and stakeholders feel the benefits of the analysis
   very early on by iteratively specifying information needs and by

Abstract = {Background: There is a growing interest in linking aspects of
   patient-provider communication to rehabilitation outcomes. However, the
   field lacks a conceptual understanding on: (a) how' rehabilitation
   outcomes can be improved by communication; and (b) through which'
   elements in particular. This article elaborates on the conceptual
   developments toward informing further practice and research.
   Methods: Existing models of communication in healthcare were adapted to
   rehabilitation, and its outcomes through a comprehensive literature
   review.
   Results: After depicting mediating mechanisms and variables (e.g.
   therapeutic engagement, adjustment toward disability), this article
   presents the 4 Rehab Communication Elements' deemed likely to underpin
   rehabilitation outcomes. The four elements are: (a) knowing the person
   and building a supportive relationship; (b) effective information
   exchange and education; (c) shared goal-setting and action planning; and
   (d) fostering a more positive, yet realistic, cognitive and
   self-reframing.
   Discussion: This article describes an unprecedented, outcomes-oriented
   approach toward the design of rehabilitation communication, which has
   resulted in the development of a new intervention model: the 4 Rehab
   Communication Elements'. Further trials are needed to evaluate the
   impact of this whole intervention model on rehabilitation outcomes.},

Abstract = {Recent work has attempted to deliver optimized distributed energy
   resource management, including the use of demand side management through
   smart homes. This aims to reduce power transmission losses, increase the
   generation share of renewable energy sources and create new markets
   through peak shaving and flexibility markets. Further, this leverages
   the development of product models at the device, building, and network
   level within the operational lifecycle stage, beyond the conventional
   role of BIM between design and construction stages. However, the
   management of heterogeneous software entities, incompatible data models
   and domain perspectives, across systems of systems of significant
   complexity, represent critical barriers to sustainable urban energy
   solutions and leads to a highly challenging problem space. The presented
   work describes a systemic approach based on the concept of holonic
   systems, which exemplify the role of autonomy, belonging, connectivity,
   diversity and emergence across entities. This reduces the decision
   complexity of the problem and facilitates the implementation of
   optimized solutions in real power systems in a scalable and robust
   manner. Further, the concept of a flexibility market is introduced,
   whereby smart appliance owners are able to sell load curtailment and
   deferment to a local aggregator, which interfaces between a small number
   of homes and a distribution system operator. Artificial intelligence is
   present at each of the entities in order to express constraints, trade
   energy and flexibility, and optimize the network management decisions
   within that entity's scope. Specifically, this paper focuses on enabling
   interoperability between system entities such as smart homes, local load
   aggregators, and last mile network operators. This interoperability is
   achieved through ontological modelling of the domain, based on the
   existing standards of CIM, OpenADR, and energy@home. The produced
   ontology utilizes description logic to formalize the concepts,
   relationships and properties of the domain. A use case is presented of
   applying the ontology within a multi-agent system, which enables the
   optimization of day-ahead markets, load balancing, and stochastic
   renewable generation, and closely aligns with the holonic approach to
   deliver a holonic multi-agent system. The use case assumes a scenario in
   line with the emerging energy landscape of a district of domestic
   prosumers, with a high penetration of micro-generation, energy storage
   and electric vehicles. Initial results demonstrate interoperability
   between heterogeneous agents through ontological modelling based on an
   integration and extension of existing standards, which acts as a proof
   of concept for the approach.},

Title = {The Mechanisms of Constructing the Image of the Far Eastern Provincial

Abstract = {The article presents an analysis aimed at identifying an axiological
   strategy of forming a positive image of Komsomolsk-on-Amur in different
   historical periods. When creating a positive image of a provincial city,
   a regional identity is formed, which contributes to solving one of the
   most pressing problems for the Russian Far East, related to the need to
   preserve human resources.
   The paper examines the modern stage of forming a positive image of the
   city based on the example of the electronic version of the newspaper
   ``Far East Komsomolsk-on-Amur{''}, since the media have different
   functions in the modern society, including the informative and
   ideological functions. The identified ways of creating a positive image
   include building a new model of life during the construction of the
   city, aimed at a bright future of the city which is full of cultural
   events, spreading information about happy life in the city by fixing and
   informing the whole country about the achievements of Komsomolsk-on-Amur
   residents and updating information about the heroic past of the city. So
   far, the methods influencing the image of Komsomolsk-on-Amur have not
   undergone significant changes since the Soviet times. Therefore, the
   analysis of the texts taken from the city's newspapers has made it
   possible to determine the leading dominants in the axiological strategy
   of creating a positive image of Komsomolsk-on-Amur.},

Title = {Identifying Risk Indicators for Natural Hazard-Related Power Outages as
   a Component of Risk Assessment: An Analysis Using Power Outage Data from
   Hurricane Irma},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Extensive use has been made of lifecycle-cost assessment to enhance the
   cost-effectiveness and resilience of facilities management. However, if
   such assessments are to be truly effective, supplemental information
   will be needed on the major costs to be expected over buildings' entire
   lives. Electricity generation and distribution systems, for example, are
   absolutely indispensable to industry and human society, not least in the
   operation of buildings and other infrastructure as networks. The
   widespread disruption that ensues when such power systems are damaged
   often carries considerable repair costs. Natural disasters likewise can
   cause extensive societal, economic, and environmental damage. Such
   damage is often associated with lengthy power outages that, as well as
   being directly harmful, can hinder emergency response and recovery.
   Accordingly, the present study investigated the correlations of natural
   hazard indicators such as wind speed and rainfall, along with
   environmental data regarding the power failure in Florida caused by
   Hurricane Irma in 2017 utilizing multiple regression analysis. The
   environmental data in question, selected on the basis of a thorough
   literature review, was tree density. Our analysis indicated that the
   independent variables, maximum wind speed, total rainfall, and tree
   density, were all significantly correlated with the dependent variable,
   power failure. Among these, rainfall was the least significant. Despite
   there being only three independent variables in the model, its adjusted
   coefficient of determination (0.512) indicated its effectiveness as a
   predictor of the power outages caused by Hurricane Irma. As such, our
   results can serve the construction industry's establishment of advanced
   safety guidelines and structural designs power transmission systems in
   regions at risk of hurricanes and typhoons. Additionally, insurance
   companies' loss-assessment modeling for power-system facilities would
   benefit from incorporating the three identified risk indicators.
   Finally, our findings can serve as a useful reference to policymakers
   tasked with mitigating power outages' effects on infrastructure in
   hurricane-prone areas. It is hoped that this work will be extended,
   facilitating infrastructure restoration planning and making societies
   and economies more sustainable.},

Title = {The role of process engineering in the digital transformation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The process engineering discipline has been largely excluded from
   Digital Transformation trends. The objective of this paper is to provide
   an overview of the obstacles to Digital Transformation for the process
   discipline and explain how these can be overcome. A special emphasis
   will be given on the role of the process simulation tool (white box
   modeling) as a catalyst for transformational change. The paper will
   examine several challenges specific to process engineering: 1) Process
   simulators are divided into single-purpose point solutions. Separate
   models may be cre-ated for process design, control strategy design,
   operator training simulation, performance monitoring and online
   optimization. 2) Process simulators are typically poorly integrated into
   engineering workflows beyond the process world, and if so, with a single
   directional information flow. 3) Legacy process simulators are
   overloaded with niche features and functions only usable by experts.
   Industry stakeholders see the Digital Twin as the most important
   building block for Digital Transfor-mation of the process industries.
   While legacy simulators are well-suited to accurately simulate
   processes, their decades-old architectures mean they are not ideal to
   serve the entire plant lifecycle and support the Digital Transformation.
   We will use the AVEVA Process Simulation as an example of how the
   identified obstacles can be overcome with a next generation process
   simulator. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predicting long-term average concentrations of traffic-related air

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {542-553},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Global regression models were developed to estimate individual levels of
   long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants. The models are
   based on data of a one-year measurement programme including geographic
   data on traffic and population densities. This investigation is part of
   a cohort study on the impact of traffic-related air pollution on
   respiratory health, conducted at the westerly end of the Ruhr-area in
   North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany.
   Concentrations of NO2, fine particle mass (PM2.5) and filter absorbance
   Of PM2.5 as a marker for soot were measured at 40 sites spread
   throughout the study region. Fourteen-day samples were taken between
   March 2002 and March 2003 for each season and site. Annual average
   concentrations for the sites were determined after adjustment for
   temporal variation.
   Information on traffic counts in major roads, building densities and
   community population figures were collected in a geographical
   information system (GIs). This information was used to calculate
   different potential traffic-based predictors: (a) daily traffic flow and
   maximum traffic intensity of buffers with radii from 50 to 10000m and
   (b) distances to main roads and highways.
   NO2 concentration and PM2.5 absorbance were strongly correlated with the
   traffic-based variables. Linear regression prediction models, which
   involved predictors with radii of 50 to 1000 m, were developed for the
   Wesel region where most of the cohort members lived. They reached a
   model fit (R-2) of 0.81 and 0.65 for NO2 and PM2.5 absorbance,
   respectively. Regression models for the whole area required larger
   spatial scales and reached R-2 = 0.90 and 0.82. Comparison of predicted
   values with NO2 measurements at independent public monitoring stations
   showed a satisfactory association (r = 0.66). PM2.5 concentration,
   however, was only slightly correlated and thus poorly predictable by
   traffic-based variables (r < 0.3).
   We concluded that NO2 and soot can be considered truly traffic-related
   pollutants, and that GIS-based regression models offer a promising
   approach to assess individual levels of exposure to these pollutants.

   Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from
   construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit
   CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and
   non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a
   decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of
   the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects
   lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and
   what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the
   adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of
   structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate
   the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework
   for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The
   findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs
   relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new
   dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2)
   Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is
   decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new
   level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance
   collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data
   sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main
   non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy,
   interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the
   decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed
   framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the
   key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks
   for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0
   to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united
   BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security,
   efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of
   projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE).},

Title = {Knowledge-Building Approach for Tsunami Impact Analysis Aided by Citizen
   Science},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Even though the impact from large tsunamis are limited to coastal areas,
   these events are still devastating. Knowledge is crucial in minimizing
   the losses from natural disasters, as it can aid in creating better and
   more proactive preparation. Focusing on natural hazards' mitigation in
   Asia, a collaboration between 10 Asian and two European countries, based
   on a deeper understanding approach, has been conducted since 2015.
   Deeper understanding aims to discover the physical mechanisms and
   drivers behind a hazard event. Innovative models and simulation
   facilities are developed correspondingly to achieve more accurate
   numerical simulations of the whole lifespan of the target event. An
   application framework composed from the knowledge, data, simulation
   facility, software tools, and case studies is designed to provide an
   advanced estimation of hazard risk and would be evolved progressively
   with more case studies and observation data. For tsunamis, based on the
   COMCOT (COrnell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami Model), the simulation portal
   (iCOMCOT) implementing parallelized tsunami wave propagation calculation
   over distributed clouds had been established. The iCOMCOT system
   finished the simulation of the whole lifecycle of the 2011 Great East
   Japan Earthquake Tsunami in 1 min. In this regional collaboration, case
   studies on historical events and tsunami impact analysis were conducted.
   The goal is to capture the physical characteristics of the tsunami as
   much as possible, such as tsunami wave propagation, tsunami refraction,
   and tsunami run-up on land, as well as their drivers and root causes.
   The whole processes of the tsunami, from its initiation to its impacts
   in selected locations, then could be simulated accurately by iCOMCOT
   based on the scientific explorations and the quantitatively revised
   models. The Sulawesi Tsunami (2018) case is presented to demonstrate the
   processes of the deeper understanding approach and how to achieve the
   capacity building. At the same time, ways to take advantage of citizen
   science are also explored. The citizen science model is valuable in
   supporting data collection, such as data of run-up height, inundation
   range, flow depth, disruption information, impact area, from
   publication, news reports, and interviews from local people. According
   to experiences on case studies, suggestions to simplify and optimize the
   integration of the citizen science model with the deeper understanding
   approach to result in a lower operation cost are provided.},

Abstract = {Soil andwater bio-engineering structures use live plants and parts of
   plants as a building material. One of the main features of these
   structures, and strategies in general, is the stabilization role
   transfer between the inert material used for achieving the initial
   necessary rigidity and stability and the evolving living material that
   contributes towards stability later on in the design life of the
   structure. This dynamic nature of the bioengineering structures can be
   reflected in terms of both the soil shear strength improvement and the
   structural deterioration processes of the biodegradable material used
   (e.g. timber elements) in the construction of the structure. A realistic
   and optimized structural design of these works must make allowance for
   these processes. An adapted design methodology addressing the preceding
   particularities is presented in this study, supported by a practical,
   real-life case study illustrating the proposed design methodology. In a
   novel approach, in this study, the mechanical behavior of rooted soil is
   simulated as composite material where plant root and soil have their
   mechanical properties synchronized in terms of stresses and strains.
   Additionally, the information collected during the monitoring stage of
   the bioengineering structure was used as a feedback and input into the
   calibration and enhancement of the modeled performance of the
   bioengineering work throughout its service life. Based on this, and
   given the semi-empirical nature of this type of works, we propose
   intrinsic adaptive management strategies that can be applied to the
   whole range of soil and water bio-engineering structures.},

   Contemporary methods of vocational training and academic education
   already realise the importance of combining instruments based upon all
   our senses to achieve optimal results in different subject areas. On the
   other hand, enhancing our knowledge of the history of humanity from
   deepest past to nowadays is a constant process of both formal and
   informal life-long learning.
   Key element in the learning process is the constantly developing tools
   based on Information Technologies. Virtual reality, computer animation,
   3D modelling, as well as the variety of devices and their increasing
   accessibility provide an ever-wider variety of learning experiences.
   From recreation of single objects of cultural heritage to astounding
   animated digital reconstructions of whole buildings and even cities, the
   IT tools become a powerful mean to improve the understanding and the
   ability to perceive the world.
   This paper aims at presenting an overview of the different 3D animated

Title = {Combining Trend-Based Loss with Neural Network for Air Quality
   Forecasting in Internet of Things},
Journal = {CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},

Pages = {849-863},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects things in a special
   union. It embeds a physical entity through an intelligent perception
   system to obtain information about the component at any time. It
   connects various objects. IoT has the ability of information
   transmission, information perception, and information processing. The
   air quality forecasting has always been an urgent problem, which affects
   people's quality of life seriously. So far, many air quality prediction
   algorithms have been proposed, which can be mainly classified into two
   categories. One is regression-based prediction, the other is deep
   learning-based prediction. Regression-based prediction is aimed to make
   use of the classical regression algorithm and the various supervised
   meteorological characteristics to regress the meteorological value. Deep
   learning methods usually use convolutional neural networks (CNN) or
   recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict the meteorological value. As
   an excellent feature extractor, CNN has achieved good performance in
   many scenes. In the same way, as an efficient network for orderly data
   processing, RNN has also achieved good results. However, few or none of
   the above methods can meet the current accuracy requirements on
   prediction. Moreover, there is no way to pay attention to the trend
   monitoring of air quality data. For the sake of accurate results, this
   paper proposes a novel predicted-trend-based loss function (PTB), which
   is used to replace the loss function in RNN. At the same time, the trend
   of change and the predicted value are constrained to obtain more
   accurate prediction results of PM2.5. In addition, this paper extends
   the model scenario to the prediction of the whole existing training data
   features. All the data on the next day of the model is mixed labels,
   which effectively realizes the prediction of all features. The
   experiments show that the loss function proposed in this paper is
   effective.},

Abstract = {The integration of blockchain and digital twins (DT) for better
   building-lifecycle data management has recently received much attention
   from researchers in the field. In this respect, the adoption of enabling
   technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
   (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and edge computing, Big Data
   analytics, etc., has also been investigated in an abundance of studies.
   The present review inspects the recent studies to shed light on the
   foremost among those enabling technologies and their scope, challenges,
   and integration potential. To this end, 86 scientific papers, recognized
   and retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, were
   reviewed and a thorough bibliometric analysis was performed on them. The
   obtained results demonstrate the nascency of the research in this field
   and the necessity of further implementation of practical methods to
   discover and prove the real potential of these technologies and their
   fusion. It was also found that the integration of these technologies can
   be beneficial for addressing the implementation challenges they face
   individually. In the end, an abstract descriptive model is presented to
   provide a better understanding of how the technologies can become
   integrated into a unified system for smartening the built environment.},

Title = {Skilled Embodiment in Emergency Medicine The ``interactivity turn{''}

Abstract = {This paper applies a multiscalar interactivity perspective in the study
   of how healthcare professionals enact skilled embodiment in ways that
   allow them to animate their rich environment during task performance.
   However, in focusing on interactivity, we are not only interested in the
   characteristics of embodiment as they are enacted in the here-and-now.
   While task performance involves not only the whole body (as a
   multi-sensory organ), but a historical, skilled body that affects the
   ecology in which a person is embedded, action-perception must be viewed
   as direct and distributed. That is, habitual performance and skilled
   embodiment emerge in coordination with lived experience and real-time
   affordances for action. Specifically, this paper investigates two
   real-life cases of how patients and medical staff engage in
   interactivity through rich embodiment including languaging. From an
   interactivity perspective, the first case indicates a novice doctor's
   inability to pick up relevant information in the emergency medicine
   ecology. The outcome can be crucial and span patient dissatisfaction,
   erroneous results, and generally insufficient, and unsatisfactory
   healthcare. The second case provides a counterexample and illustrates
   how novice doctors can be supported in picking up task-relevant
   information as they can rely on other team members' skilled embodiment.
   The article concludes that an interactivity perspective has implications
   not just for model-building in linguistics, semiotics and the cognitive
   sciences but also for practice where educational initiatives adopt the
   epistemologies behind such linguistic, communicative and cognitive
   models.},

Abstract = {Traffic assignment is of great importance in real life from foot traffic
   assignment of a building to vehicle traffic assignment of a city. With
   the rapid increase of the number of agents and the size of the traffic
   network, the problem becomes more and more challenging nowadays. To
   solve large-scale efficient dynamic traffic assignment, this article
   proposes a decentralized control approach to achieving this. First, we
   transform the traffic assignment problem into a routing rule generation
   problem by designing a corresponding simulation-based optimization
   framework that can evaluate the performance of routing rules. Then, we
   propose a genetic programming hyper-heuristic algorithm to generate the
   optimal routing rule. During execution, agents can collect environmental
   information and plan their paths when moving according to the generated
   rule. In this way, the proposed method can handle the dynamically
   changing traffic flow efficiently instead of pre-planing the whole path
   for each agent. The proposed method is verified on both synthetic
   networks and real-world networks in terms of sensitivity, generality,
   and scalability. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is
   effective in urban-scale traffic networks and outperforms the compared
   algorithms.},

Abstract = {This conceptual paper seeks to put forth a novel vision, namely the
   combined deployment of the Quadruple Helix Model (QHM) collaboration
   mooted by Agensi Inovasi Malaysia, a Whole-of-Government (WoG) concept
   of ICT implementation across the Malaysian government agencies mooted by
   Malaysia Administrative and Modernization Planning Unit (MAMPU) and the
   Network of Mosques (NoM). This will be accomplished through leveraging
   the advances in cloud computing and mobile applications in setting up a
   proposed conceptual MyMukim2Cloud Collaborative System. The QHM actors,
   namely the Government, Academia, Industry and Citizen need to
   collaborate and share resources in nurturing and addressing the needs of
   less privileged and less fortunate people holistically, rather than the
   current practice which is executed in silos, isolation or independently.
   This proposed collaborative inter-organizational system is to enable a
   WoG and consolidated approach for government agencies, NGOs, the private
   sector and individuals in building up a single and trusted national
   database based on three (3) focus groups of people proposed in this
   paper, namely the Orphanage, the Poor and the Disabled. This database,
   proposed to be co-owned and managed by government agencies such as
   Department of Social Welfare (DSW) and Department of Islamic Development
   Malaysia (JAKIM), can be accessed, used and updated by all other
   authorized and relevant organizations and individuals in making a
   consolidated contribution in nurturing and developing these groups.
   Thus, this System shall eliminate unnecessary and duplication in data,
   efforts and investments made by the various organizations. The expected
   outcome of MyMukim2Cloud System will be an enhanced quality of life for
   the proposed focus groups through the execution of social
   entrepreneurship concept in healthcare, education and financial
   activities provided by the QHM collaborators.},

Title = {Regional Atmospheric Aerosol Pollution Detection Based on LiDAR Remote
   Sensing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol is one of the major factors that cause environmental
   pollution. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an effective remote
   sensing tool for aerosol observation. In order to provide a
   comprehensive understanding of the aerosol pollution from the physical
   perspective, this study investigated regional atmospheric aerosol
   pollution through the integration of measurements, including LiDAR,
   satellite, and ground station observations and combined the backward
   trajectory tracking model. First, the horizontal distribution of
   atmospheric aerosol wa obtained by a whole-day working scanning
   micro-pulse LiDAR placed on a residential building roof. Another
   micro-pulse LiDAR was arranged at a distance from the scanning LiDAR to
   provide the vertical distribution information of aerosol. A new method
   combining the slope and Fernald methods was then proposed for the
   retrieval of the horizontal aerosol extinction coefficient. Finally,
   whole-day data, including the LiDAR data, the satellite remote sensing
   data, meteorological data, and backward trajectory tracking model, were
   selected to reveal the vertical and horizontal distribution
   characteristics of aerosol pollution and to provide some evidence of the
   potential pollution sources in the regional area. Results showed that
   the aerosol pollutants in the district on this specific day were mainly
   produced locally and distributed below 2.0 km. Six areas with high
   aerosol concentration were detected in the scanning area, showing that
   the aerosol pollution was mainly obtained from local life,
   transportation, and industrial activities. Correlation analysis with the
   particulate matter data of the ground air quality national control
   station verified the accuracy of the LiDAR detection results and
   revealed the effectiveness of LiDAR detection of atmospheric aerosol
   pollution.},

Abstract = {The transformation of the built environment requires more and more
   frequently the use of an intelligent management system that is able to
   offer multiple and simultaneous responses on the issues about the
   quality life of modern citizens : Economy, People, Mobility, Governance,
   Environment and Living.
   This paper pointes out some results of a research aimed to highlight,
   through the comparison of international experiences, the adaptability of
   smartness concept to a Mediterranean context area characterized by a
   great cultural value. There are several models of reference : some
   examples of sustainable neighborhoods in Europe, the smart street and
   the smart building in Northern Europe and the Action Plan of Copenhagen,
   Vancouver and London.
   The results achieved from the systematizing of these different study
   cases shows how the concept of smartness applied to the urban context
   isn't inclined to assert itself as a template to be replicated in a
   serial manner in all geographic areas.
   However, it is possible in every urban reality read the specifics of the
   area in terms of strengths and weaknesses; aim at the creation of
   networked integrative superstructures; focus the propulsion nodal
   centers of growth and ensure the continuity of the system through the
   collection of data and information used in short, medium and long term.
   In this sense Smart City is an opportunity for the city as a whole.
   Besides the tantalizing prospect of the access to funding available for
   the public authorities, it represents a real opportunity to open up to
   international experiences becoming the protagonist of the
   transformation.},

Abstract = {The process engineering discipline has been largely excluded from
   Digital Transformation trends. The objective of this presentation is to
   provide an overview of the obstacles to Digital Transformation for the
   process discipline and explain how these can be overcome. A special
   emphasis will be given on the role of the process simulation tool (white
   box modelling) as a catalyst for transformational change.
   The presentation will examine several challenges specific to process
   engineering:
   1) Process simulators are divided into single-purpose point solutions.
   Separate models may be created for process design, control strategy
   design, operator training simulation, performance monitoring and online
   optimization.
   2) Process simulators are typically poorly integrated into engineering
   workflows beyond the process world, and if so, with a single directional
   information flow.
   3) Legacy process simulators are overloaded with niche features and
   functions only usable by experts.
   4) The potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
   Learning for process engineering are not widely understood.
   Industry stakeholders see the Digital Twin as the most important
   building block for Digital Transformation of the process industries.
   While legacy simulators are well-suited to accurately simulate
   processes, their decades-old architectures mean they are not ideal to
   serve the entire plant lifecycle and support the Digital Transformation.
   We will use the AVEVA SimCentral Simulation Platform(4) as an example of
   how the identified obstacles can be overcome with a next generation
   process simulator. Case examples from leading companies will be
   outlined.},

Title = {Bibliometric review of improvements in building maintenance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {437-456},
Abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to review the status of knowledge
   on the subject of building maintenance from an integrated perspective
   that incorporates the building lifecycle, that is, from the design stage
   to the end of life. This work considered the main aspects to be taken
   into account in determining and implementing maintenance strategies,
   which requires a cross-sectional view of the entire construction
   process. At the same time, this approach contributes to the organisation
   of building management.
   Design/methodology/approach-Bibliometric review has been carried out to
   identify relevant subjects and topics about scientific production on
   building maintenance by analysing the contents of about 745
   publications, over the last 15 years, between 2000 and 2016 (first
   quarter). The survey results were gradually organised into a database
   grouped into seven main themes which were found to be more discussed and
   others six emergent themes with topics on building maintenance research.
   Findings-This research enabled a synthesis of the focal points in the
   literature on building maintenance, as well as debates among researchers
   and institutions in the field. The result is a view to the future
   regarding what issues merit further research and what content requires
   greater depth of understanding, allowing us to envision research
   directions that encompass topics and sub-topics for future development.
   To this end, this bibliometric study draws on knowledge developed over
   the last 15 years, using research studies published in refereed journals
   indexed in ISI/SCOPUS as its data source.
   Originality/value-The novelty of this topic, and the aspect in which it
   differs from existing studies, is that the researchers analysed a single
   sub-topic: that is, content regarding maintenance. Thus, this
   bibliometric literature review allows us to achieve a comprehensive and
   integrated view of key issues developed in the field of building
   maintenance. The results show which topics have been more thoroughly
   developed and which still exhibit gaps and weaknesses. This review
   allows us to envision well thought out guidelines for future development
   that have the potential to be relevant to progress in building
   maintenance research. It also contributes to our understanding of the
   state of the art in this field of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Contemporary precast large-panel buildings, due to their precise
   production, the usage of new generation materials and the latest
   technological solutions in the field of joints, allow on production of
   safe, functional and aestetics buildings. Prefabrication shorten time of
   building implementation, as well as make it possible to build in
   difficult conditions. It should be underlined, that this technology
   promotes construction of environmentally friendly structures throughout
   their lifecycle starting from reduction of CO2 emission in production
   process, trough the reduction of noise and dust emission on construction
   site, to the possibility of easy demolition and re-use parts of its
   components.
   The development of concrete precast construction in next years will be
   probably related with:
   - actions aimed at improving quality, where ``quality{''} means not only
   materials and production quality but also as a comfort of the building
   usage during its sustainability;
   - development and implementation of almost zero energy building,
   progress in the range of acoustics or vibrations protection;
   - implementation of BIM technology faciliting the cooperation between
   investor, designers of all branches, precast elements suppliers and
   general performer and others;
   - resignation of rigid dimensional modules and limitation of
   typification system mainly to solutions of joints or boundary
   dimensions;
   - the usage of differentiated types of facade layers;
   - limitation of the quantity or elimination of visible joints of precast
   elements;
   - introduction of more and more higher spans of floors;
   - construction of higher and higher buildings the highest large-panel
   building in Europe, ``Strijkijzer{''} built in Hague in 2007, has 42
   floors with total height of 132 m.
   Undoubtedly, from all construction fields, the prefabrication area is
   one of the most open to the creation and implementation of innovative
   solutions, both in the range of materials and accessories, which are
   used, and also in the improvement of production equipment, as well as in
   the new concepts concerning design and buildings construction. In
   developed countries, this fact is related with wide-scale collaboration
   of science centres with manufacturers of technology and materials on the
   one hand, and on the other hand-with investors, designers and building
   contractors. I am convinced, that the development of prefabrication on
   the Polish market, consisting in creating own, innovative solutions, and
   not only the implementation of foreign solutions, requires just such a
   lasting cooperation.},

Abstract = {The mission of state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) has evolved,
   and their perception has shifted from focusing on constructing new
   assets to managing and maintaining existing transportation assets and
   optimizing asset performance. In response to this change, state DOTs
   began adopting a ``transportation asset management{''} approach, an
   intensive data-driven decision-making process to maintain and extend the
   serviceability of transportation assets throughout their lifecycle.
   However, state DOTs continue to face challenges in conducting
   cross-asset system analysis and integrating data across systems
   throughout the asset lifecycle. Conversely, emerging technologies,
   namely Digital Twins, have the potential to leverage the value of asset
   data and transform data into valuable insights to inform
   decision-making. The definition of Digital Twins in the infrastructure
   industry is inconsistent, and the transition toward a digitized built
   environment-a preliminary step required for a successful implementation
   of Digital Twins-has not been investigated. Thus, this paper presents
   the burning platform for the need for Digital Twins and defines the
   concept. Additionally, this study investigates the current practices of
   state DOTs toward the digital transition of their transportation asset
   data and contextualizes the DOTs' maturity in the advancement of digital
   processes. This paper focuses on ancillary asset systems, particularly
   Roadside, Electronic, and Drainage Asset systems. A web-based survey was
   developed and distributed to state DOTs for data collection. For each
   asset, the perceived timeline for digitization was investigated, and
   three variables related to data digitization were explored: data format,
   data level of detail, and data collection technique.},

Title = {Development of a Multi-Criteria Design Optimization Methodology for
   Automotive Plastics Parts},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The plastic industry is undergoing drastic changes, due to the customer
   sustainability perception of plastics, and the eruption of new processes
   (such 3D printing) and materials (such as renewably sourced resins). To
   enable a fast transition to high-quality, sustainable plastic
   applications, a specific methodology could be a key competitive
   advantage. This novel methodology is focused on improving the
   objectivity and efficiency of plastic production and the design review
   process. It is applicable to discrete optimization events in any product
   lifecycle milestone, from concept design to serial production stages.
   The methodology includes a natural way to capture plastic-related
   knowledge and trends, oriented towards building a dynamic ``interaction
   matrix{''}, with a list of potential optimizations and their positive or
   negative impacts in a comprehensive set of multi-criteria evaluations.
   With an innovative approach, the matrix allows the possibility to
   incorporate a business strategy, which could be different at every
   lifecycle stage. The business strategy is translated from the common
   ``verbal{''} definition into a quantitative set of ``Target and
   Restrictions{''}, making it possible to detect and prioritize the best
   potential design optimization changes according to the strategy. This
   methodology helps to model and compare design alternatives, verify
   impacts in every evaluation criteria, and make robust and objective
   information-based decisions. The application of the methodology in real
   cases of plastic material design optimization in the automotive industry
   has provided remarkable results, accelerating the detection of
   improvement methods aligned with the strategy and maximizing the
   improvement in product competitiveness and sustainability. In comparison
   with the simultaneous application of existing mono-criteria optimization
   methodologies (such as ``Design to Cost{''} or ``Eco Design{''}) and
   subjective expert-based reviews, the novel methodology has a reduced
   workload and risks, confirming its potential for future application and
   further development in other polymer-based products, such as consumer
   goods or packaging.},

Abstract = {The information that is transferred among communication systems by using
   different technologies is the general telecommunication which helps in
   building the global business empires. As this infrastructure has good
   economic benefits, there is an increasing issue with the arbitrary
   access to these telecommunication services. It has a played a very
   predominant role in social Relationships. A customer is the one who
   plays the dominant role for every organization and he/she is the
   resource upon which the success of every business depends within the
   organization. Managing the customer Relationship is the important and
   the most efficient technique in creating and managing robust
   Relationships with customers. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is
   any method which determines the practices followed, strategies adopted
   and various technologies that organizations use to maintain and consider
   the customer interactions and data of the entire customer lifecycle,
   with the target of making better business Relationships with customers,
   assisting in customer confinement and driving thesales growth. The
   MicrosoftDynamics CRM focuses on three important modules namely
   marketing, sales and service thus focusing on the entire business
   process for an organization. The telecom services being provided now
   have a poor user interface and user experience thus lacks a real
   business process management. They don't support third party plugins
   which acts as a drawback for the system. Thus using Dynamics CRM for
   telecom services would achieve good results in practice.},

Abstract = {Today's feature-rich smartphone apps intensively rely on access to
   highly sensitive (personal) data. This puts the user's privacy at risk
   of being violated by overly curious apps or libraries (like
   advertisements). Central app markets conceptually represent a first line
   of defense against such invasions of the user's privacy, but
   unfortunately we are still lacking full support for automatic analysis
   of apps' internal data flows and supporting analysts in statically
   assessing apps' behavior.
   In this paper we present a novel slice-optimization approach to leverage
   static analysis of Android applications. Building on top of precise
   application lifecycle models, we employ a slicing-based analysis to
   generate data-dependent statements for arbitrary points of interest in
   an application. As a result of our optimization, the produced slices
   are, on average, 49\% smaller than standard slices, thus facilitating
   code understanding and result validation by security analysts. Moreover,
   by re-targeting strings, our approach enables automatic assessments for
   a larger number of use-cases than prior work. We consolidate our
   improvements on statically analyzing Android apps into a tool called
   R-DROID and conducted a large-scale data-leak analysis on a set of
   22,700 Android apps from Google Play. R-DROID managed to identify a
   significantly larger set of potential privacy-violating information
   flows than previous work, including 2,157 sensitive flows of
   password-flagged UI widgets in 256 distinct apps.},

Abstract = {Information Technology Outsourcing practice and research mainly
   considers the outsourcing phenomenon as a generic fulfilment of the IT
   function by external parties. Inspired by the logic of commodity, core
   competencies and economies of scale; assets, existing departments and IT
   functions are transferred to external parties. Although the generic
   approach might work for desktop outsourcing, where standardisation is
   the dominant factor, it does not work for the management of mission
   critical applications. Managing mission critical applications requires a
   different approach where building relationships is critical. The
   relationships involve inter and intra organisational parties in a
   multi-sourcing arrangement, called an IT service chain, consisting of
   multiple (specialist) parties that have to collaborate closely to
   deliver high quality services.
   To better understand the evolution of relationships in such an IT chain,
   we propose a modelling technique for the structure and evolution of the
   organizational aspects these relationships. Understanding this structure
   is relevant in discerning how interactions take place during the
   lifecycle of the outsourcing relationship. To validate the modelling
   technique we studied a Dutch provider of Mission Critical Outsourcing
   services, which is ranked independently as a quality market leader. In
   two international internet banking environments we analyse the evolution
   of the inter and intra organizational structure. The contribution of
   this paper is an approach to understanding the evolution of the
   organizational structure of collaborative multi-sourcing arrangements.
   Understanding the evolution of these structures is deemed relevant for
   the further study of successful high quality multisourcing arrangements.},

Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of Industry 4.0, the Asset
   Administration Shell (AAS) is a fundamental building block for
   developing digital twins. This paper presents an innovative approach to
   automatically generate Application Programming Interfaces (API) for
   AAS-based systems from a formalized specification. So far, the
   convention was to manually specify the API for AAS by tedious
   translation of the abstract specification published in form of a book.
   We propose, instead, to formalize the abstract specification, and
   automatically translate it into API. We thus streamline the development
   process, ensure effectiveness, and minimize the risk of errors in the
   representation of digital twins otherwise inherent in the manual
   procedure. Our proposed approach places great importance on automating
   the development of AAS APIs, using common and widespread YAML/OpenAPI as
   a serialization format due to its clarity and simplicity. Additionally,
   the paper examines other Interface Descriptions such as Protobuf, SOAP,
   GraphQL, and WSDL, emphasising the significance of clearly defined
   interfaces for efficient AAS API utilisation.
   Our method guarantees scalability and flexibility, specifically in
   relation to SDK generation, whereby different AAS interfaces are
   generated to support smooth integration within the constantly changing
   landscape of Industry 4.0. This comprehensive approach facilitates the
   entire lifecycle of digital twin development, spanning from API
   generation to SDK development, to ensure resilient and adaptable
   solutions agnostic to particular serialization formats.},

Abstract = {The growing trend for delivering physical products to customers as parts
   of product service systems (PSS) is creating a need for a new generation
   of Computer Aided Design (CAD) system to support the design of PSS:
   so-called ``PSS-CAD{''}. Key research issues in the development of such
   systems include building understanding of the kinds of applications that
   designers of PSS might need and the establishment of well-founded
   representation schemes to underpin and support communication between
   PSS-CAD systems. Recent literature includes numerous descriptions of
   integrated PSS development processes, PSS-CAD tools to support these
   processes and early meta-models to provide information support. This
   paper complements this work by proposing a representation scheme that is
   a key prerequisite to achieving the interoperability between PSS-CAD
   systems which would be necessary to support the deployment of integrated
   PSS development processes in industry.
   The representation scheme, a form of meta-model, draws on learning from
   the product definition community that emerged in the 1970s in response
   to a need for interoperability between the different shape-based CAD
   systems that were being developed at the time. The initial focus on
   shape representation has developed to digital product definitions that
   define the design of a product coupled with meta-data recording details
   of processes by which the design was created and, more recently,
   supported through-life. Similarly, PSS-related information includes both
   PSS definitions, to support the lifecycles of physical products and
   associated services, and meta-data needed to support the management of
   PSS development processes.
   This paper focuses on information requirements for the definition of
   service elements of PSS and relationships with product elements and
   service actors. These requirements are derived from earlier work on the
   use of service blueprinting for the visualisation and mapping of service
   activities to deliver different types of service contract. Key
   information requirements addressed include the need to represent service
   process flow and breakdown structures, relationships between service and
   product elements, substitution relationships, and service variants. A
   representation scheme is proposed and demonstrated through application
   to a PSS case study. The representation scheme is built on a generic
   information architecture that has already been applied to problems of
   product definition; as such there is an underlying compatibility that
   offers real promise in the future realisation of integrated PSS
   development processes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Modular integrated construction (MiC) is becoming a preferred
   construction approach for many types of building projects. However,
   several factors and conditions must converge to determine the success of
   MiC projects. This research identified and evaluated 25 critical success
   factors (CSFs) for implementing MiC projects. The dataset was generated
   through a structured questionnaire survey and analyzed using robust
   statistical techniques. Based on the mean scores, the top five CSFs for
   MiC projects include fabricator experience and capabilities in modules
   design and production; robust drawing specifications and early design
   freeze; good working collaboration, communication and information
   sharing among project participants; standardization and mass production;
   and effective coordination of the supply chain segments. An exploratory
   factor analysis generated four principal success factors (PSFs),
   comprising adequate technical capability and infrastructure; effective
   stakeholder and supply chain management; early commitment; and
   standardization and benchmarking. A fuzzy evaluation revealed that all
   the four PSFs are paramount to the success of MiC projects. As a
   contribution, the research has identified and prioritized the CSFs which
   may help MiC project managers and stakeholders in the appropriate
   allocation of limited resources. These shared CSFs may constitute
   forecasting and diagnostic tools for progressively measuring success
   along the MiC project lifecycle phases.},

Title = {A novel block-chain based secure cross-domain interaction approach for
   intelligent transportation systems},
Journal = {PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {63},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), secure and efficient
   data communication among vehicles, road testing equipment, computing
   nodes, and transportation agencies is important for building a smart
   city integrated transportation system. However, the traditional
   centralized processing approach may face threats in terms of data
   leakage and trust. The use of distributed, tamper-proof blockchain
   technology can improve the decentralized storage and security of data in
   the ITS network. However, the cross-trust domain devices, terminals, and
   transportation agencies in the heterogeneous blockchain network of the
   ITS still face great challenges in trusted data communication and
   interoperability. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous cross-chain
   interaction mechanism based on relay nodes and identity encryption to
   solve the problem of data cross-domain interaction between devices and
   agencies in the ITS. First, we propose the ITS cross-chain communication
   framework and improve the cross-chain interaction model. The relay nodes
   are interconnected through LibP2P to form a relay node chain, which is
   used for cross-chain information verification and transmission.
   Secondly, we propose a relay node secure access scheme based on
   identity-based encryption (IBE) to provide reliable identity
   authentication for relay nodes. Finally, we build a standard cross-chain
   communication protocol and cross-chain transaction lifecycle for this
   mechanism. We use Hyperledger Fabric and FISCO BCOS blockchain to design
   and implement this solution, and verify the feasibility of this
   cross-chain interaction mechanism. The experimental results show that
   the mechanism can achieve a stable data cross-chain read throughput of
   2,000 transactions per second (TPS), which can meet the requirements of
   secure and efficient cross-chain communication and interaction among
   heterogeneous blockchains in the ITS, and has high application value.},

Abstract = {Reconstructing a tree of life by inferring evolutionary history is an
   important focus of evolutionary biology. Phylogenetic reconstructions
   also provide useful information for a range of scientific disciplines
   such as botany, zoology, phylogeography, archaeology and biological
   anthropology. Until the development of protein and DNA sequencing
   techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, phylogenetic reconstructions were
   based on fossil records and comparative morphological/physiological
   analyses. Since then, progress in molecular phylogenetics has
   compensated for some of the shortcomings of phenotype-based comparisons.
   Comparisons at the molecular level increase the accuracy of phylogenetic
   inference because there is no environmental influence on DNA/peptide
   sequences and evaluation of sequence similarity is not subjective. While
   the number of morphological/physiological characters that are
   sufficiently conserved for phylogenetic inference is limited, molecular
   data provide a large number of datapoints and enable comparisons from
   diverse taxa. Over the last 20years, developments in molecular
   phylogenetics have greatly contributed to our understanding of plant
   evolutionary relationships. Regions in the plant nuclear and organellar
   genomes that are optimal for phylogenetic inference have been determined
   and recent advances in DNA sequencing techniques have enabled
   comparisons at the whole genome level. Sequences from the nuclear and
   organellar genomes of thousands of plant species are readily available
   in public databases, enabling researchers without access to molecular
   biology tools to investigate phylogenetic relationships by sequence
   comparisons using the appropriate nucleotide substitution models and
   tree building algorithms. In the present review, the statistical models
   and algorithms used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees are introduced and
   advances in the exploration and utilization of plant genomes for
   molecular phylogenetic analyses are discussed.},

Abstract = {Data visualization is an essential task during the lifecycle of any Data
   Science (DS) project, particularly during the Exploratory Data Analysis
   (EDA) for a correct data preparation and understanding. In
   classification problems, data visualization is useful for revealing the
   existence of class separability patterns within the dataset. This
   information is very valuable and can be later used during the process of
   building a Machine Learning (ML) model. High-Dimensional Data (HDD)
   arise as one of the biggest challenges in DS. HDD require special
   treatment since traditional visualization techniques, such as the
   scatterplot matrix (SPLOM), have limitations when dealing with them due
   to space restrictions. Other visualization methods involve
   dimensionality reduction techniques, which can lead to losing important
   information and reducing the interpretability of the data. In this
   paper, the Class Separability Visualization (CSViz) method is introduced
   as a new Visual Analytics (VA) approach to address the challenge of
   visualizing labeled HDD through subspaces. The proposed method enables
   an overview of the class separability offering a series of 2-Dimensional
   subspaces visualizations containing exclusive subsets of points of the
   original variables that encompass the most valuable and significant
   separable patterns. The proposed method is tested over 50 datasets with
   different characteristics providing promising results. In all cases,
   more than 90\% of the data observations are shown with three plots or
   less. Hence, the presented CSViz significantly eases the EDA by reducing
   the number of plots to be inspected in a SPLOM and thus, the amount of
   time invested in it.Graphical AbstractCSViz graphical abstract},

   Manufacturing involves and then identifies Digital Twin and the related
   Digital Thread as key elements. PLM and MOM solutions support the
   Digital Twin and the Digital Thread allowing the exchange of
   product-related information between the digital manufacturing model and
   the physical manufacturing execution. A Digital Twin of a wing box and
   its assembly process is created in PLM by building the bill of material
   and bill of process. Then it is shown how in MOM system the production
   phase is facilitated by managing production operations, advanced
   scheduling and supporting the execution of the processes and how the
   analysis of the manufacturing performance is possible. The result
   integrating these systems is to have the right information at the right
   place at the right time along with the related benefits in terms of
   costs, time and quality. The activity has been developed in Siemens

   prediction: A case study within the Turkish telecommunications industry},

Abstract = {Context: Building defect prediction models in large organizations has
   many challenges due to limited resources and tight schedules in the
   software development lifecycle. It is not easy to collect data, utilize
   any type of algorithm and build a permanent model at once. We have
   conducted a study in a large telecommunications company in Turkey to
   employ a software measurement program and to predict pre-release
   defects. Based on our prior publication, we have shared our experience
   in terms of the project steps (i.e. challenges and opportunities). We
   have further introduced new techniques that improve our earlier results.
   Objective: In our previous work, we have built similar predictors using
   data representative for US software development. Our task here was to
   check if those predictors were specific solely to US organizations or to
   a broader class of software.
   Method: We have presented our approach and results in the form of an
   experience report. Specifically, we have made use of different
   techniques for improving the information content of the software data
   and the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier in the prediction model
   that is locally tuned for the company. We have increased the information
   content of the software data by using module dependency data and
   improved the performance by adjusting the hyper-parameter (decision
   threshold) of the Naive Bayes classifier. We have reported and discussed
   our results in terms of defect detection rates and false alarms. We also
   carried out a cost-benefit analysis to show that our approach can be
   efficiently put into practice.
   Results: Our general result is that general defect predictors, which
   exist across a wide range of software (in both US and Turkish
   organizations), are present. Our specific results indicate that
   concerning the organization subject to this study, the use of version
   history information along with code metrics decreased false alarms by
   22\%, the use of dependencies between modules further reduced false
   alarms by 8\%, and the decision threshold optimization for the Naive
   Bayes classifier using code metrics and version history information
   further improved false alarms by 30\% in comparison to a prediction
   using only code metrics and a default decision threshold.
   Conclusion: Implementing statistical techniques and machine learning on
   a real life scenario is a difficult yet possible task. Using simple
   statistical and algorithmic techniques produces an average detection
   rate of 88\%. Although using dependency data improves our results, it is
   difficult to collect and analyze such data in general. Therefore, we
   would recommend optimizing the hyper-parameter of the proposed
   technique, Naive Bayes, to calibrate the defect prediction model rather
   than employing more complex classifiers. We also recommend that
   researchers who explore statistical and algorithmic methods for defect
   prediction should spend less time on their algorithms and more time on
   studying the pragmatic considerations of large organizations. (C) 2010

Title = {Otolith reading and multi-model inference for improved estimation of age

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of fish age and growth is crucial for species
   conservation and management of exploited marine stocks. In exploited
   species, age estimation based on otolith reading is routinely used for
   building growth curves that are used to implement fishery management
   models. However, the universal fit of the von Bertalanffy growth
   function (VBGF) on data from commercial landings can lead to uncertainty
   in growth parameter inference, preventing accurate comparison of
   growth-based history traits between fish populations. In the present
   paper, we used a comprehensive annual sample of wild gilthead seabream
   (Sparus aurata L) in the Gulf of Lions (France, NW Mediterranean) to
   test a methodology improving growth modelling for exploited fish
   populations. After validating the timing for otolith annual increment
   formation for all life stages, a comprehensive set of growth models
   (including VBGF) were fitted to the obtained age length data, used as a
   whole or sub-divided between group 0 individuals and those coming from
   commercial landings (ages 1-6). Comparisons in growth model accuracy
   based on Akaike Information Criterion allowed assessment of the best
   model for each dataset and, when no model correctly fitted the data, a
   multi-model inference (MMI) based on model averaging was carried out.
   The results provided evidence that growth parameters inferred with VBGF
   must be used with high caution. Hence, VBGF turned to be among the less
   accurate for growth prediction irrespective of the dataset and its fit
   to the whole population, the juvenile or the adult datasets provided
   different growth parameters. The best models for growth prediction were
   the Tanaka model, for group 0 juveniles, and the MMI, for the older
   fish, confirming that growth differs substantially between juveniles and
   adults. All asymptotic models failed to correctly describe the growth of
   adult S. aurata, probably because of the poor representation of old
   individuals in the dataset. Multi-model inference associated with
   separate analysis of juveniles and adult fish is then advised to obtain
   objective estimations of growth parameters when sampling cannot be
   corrected towards older fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Risk-Based Strategies for Upgrading Existing Nonconforming Wooden Houses
   and Risk Information for Promoting Upgrading},

Abstract = {There is widespread awareness in seismic-prone countries about the
   necessity to upgrade the seismic performance of old buildings and wooden
   houses for disaster mitigation; however, upgrading occurs at a very slow
   pace. At present, Japan has approximately 11 million nonconforming old
   wooden houses, but most of them remain without upgrade because of the
   large expenditure that would be incurred by both house owners and the
   local government. An owner would need to spend approximately US\$11,000
   on average to upgrade his/her house such that it satisfies the current
   design requirements. In Aichi prefecture alone, upgrading would cost
   approximately US\$10 billion in total, which is approximately 40\% of
   the annual budget. This study, therefore, investigates alternative
   strategies for upgrading existing nonconforming wooden houses more
   efficiently and cost-effectively. The seismic risks of wooden houses as
   a whole in Aichi prefecture are estimated, and then the effective target
   level for upgrading is discussed from the viewpoint of both economic
   loss and the number of fatalities. It is shown here that it is
   worthwhile from the viewpoint of life safety to consider a target
   upgrading level that is lower than the current design requirements.
   Although the analytical models discussed in this paper might be specific
   to Japan, the framework of the risk assessment is universal and the
   conclusions drawn from this analysis are applicable to other
   seismic-prone regions and countries. DOI:

Title = {A systematic literature review of actionable alert identification
   techniques for automated static code analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {363-387},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context: Automated static analysis (ASA) identifies potential source
   code anomalies early in the software development lifecycle that could
   lead to field failures. Excessive alert generation and a large
   proportion of unimportant or incorrect alerts (unactionable alerts) may
   cause developers to reject the use of ASA. Techniques that identify
   anomalies important enough for developers to fix (actionable alerts) may
   increase the usefulness of ASA in practice.
   Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research
   results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert
   identification techniques (AAIT).
   Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic
   literature review.
   Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques
   use alert type selection; contextual information: data fusion; graph
   theory; machine learning: mathematical and statistical models; or
   dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of
   the AAITs are evaluated via an example with a variety of evaluation
   metrics.
   Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the
   premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA
   with an MIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the precision of
   the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built
   models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well
   a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted
   actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable
   alerts missed by an MIT or how well an MIT identifies unactionable
   alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and
   ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the
   current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We
   propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for
   comparison and evaluation of MIT from literature on a standard set of
   subjects and utilizing a common set of evaluation metrics. (C) 2010

   (GeoKG) quality assessment},
Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},

Month = {2024 SEP 21},
Abstract = {High-quality Geographic Knowledge Graphs (GeoKGs) are highly anticipated
   for their potential to provide reliable semantic support in geographical
   knowledge reasoning, training Geographic Large Language Models
   (Geo-LLMs), enabling geographical recommendation, and facilitating
   various geospatial knowledge-driven tasks. However, there is a lack of a
   standardized quality assessment methodology and clearly defined
   evaluative indicators in the field of GeoKGs research. This research
   uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to conduct a systematic review of
   literature and standards in the field of GeoKG in an effort to fill the
   gap. First, using the lifecycle theory as a guide, we outline and
   propose five groups including twenty assessment criteria and their
   accompanying calculation techniques for evaluating GeoKG quality. Then,
   expanding on this foundation, we present a streamlined evaluation scheme
   for GeoKGs that relies on just seven key measures, discussing their
   applicability, utility, and weight scheme in greater detail. After
   applying the GeoKG quality framework, we stated three key tasks emerge
   as priorities: the creation of specialized assessment tools, the
   formation of worldwide standards, and the building of large-scale,
   high-quality GeoKGs. We believe this thorough and systematic GeoKG
   quality assessment technique will help construct high-quality GeoKGs and
   promote GeoKGs as an engine for geo-intelligence applications including
   Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) systems, Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) analyzers, and Virtual Geographic Environments

Title = {Advanced informatic technologies for intelligent construction: A review},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Number = {A},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since there is a growing interest in driving the digital transformation
   of the construction industry, the goal of this paper is to provide a
   full picture and understanding of the emerging research front on
   intelligent construction. Through the quantitative and qualitative
   analysis, relevant pieces of literature are thoroughly reviewed to
   extract useful knowledge to raise awareness of intelligent construction,
   resulting in the summary of research status and the determination of
   future needs. In light of the research findings, the rapid development
   of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization,
   digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and
   customization, which mainly support ``4S{''} technologies. The popular
   research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the
   project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which
   are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and
   automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for
   future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud
   platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability
   under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. As for the practical
   value, a synthesized point of up-to-date reference is created to guide
   managers to promote intelligent construction in real-world engineering.},

Title = {Digital twins for aircraft maintenance and operation: A systematic
   literature review and an IoT-enabled modular architecture},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Thanks to the rapid growth of the Industry 4.0 domain and the
   innovations brought by the Internet of Things paradigm, Digital Twins
   (DT) are increasingly gaining momentum in our society and various
   companies are moving towards their adoption in many application areas.
   One of them is the aerospace sector which has started to take advantage
   of their innovative services to enhance workers' daily duties. Although
   different works already proposed solutions to apply the Digital Twin to
   the industrial domain, the airspace area has not yet completely
   benefited from its advantages. Digital Twins carve out an important role
   in the entire aircraft lifecycle management, in particular they provide
   value in the maintenance process by gathering status information for
   optimizing aircraft operations. This article aims to comprehensively
   analyse, by applying the systematic mapping method, the current state of
   the art on Digital Twin technology applied to aircraft operation and
   maintenance. The results give an overview about the innovations that the
   Digital Twins can bring in the specific current state of the art, by
   highlighting the modelling approach used for building the DT, and the
   most important extracted common information related to the most
   frequently adopted tools and the covered subsystems. As a further
   important contribution to the research community, this work provides a
   comprehensive modular architecture that acts as a summarizing artifact
   able to serve all the analysed works and discusses the open issues by
   pointing out some interesting research directions, that could lead to
   new and interesting future works and collaborations.},

Title = {Patient-centric characterization of multimorbidity trajectories in
   patients with severe mental illnesses: A temporal bipartite network
   modeling approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Multimorbidity is a major factor contributing to increased mortality
   among people with severe mental illnesses (SMI). Previous studies either
   focus on estimating prevalence of a disease in a population without
   considering relationships between diseases or ignore heterogeneity of
   individual patients in examining disease progression by looking merely
   at aggregates across a whole cohort. Here, we present a temporal
   bipartite network model to jointly represent detailed information on
   both individual patients and diseases, which allows us to systematically
   characterize disease trajectories from both patient and disease centric
   perspectives. We apply this approach to a large set of longitudinal
   diagnostic records for patients with SMI collected through a data
   linkage between electronic health records from a large UK mental health
   hospital and English national hospital administrative database. We find
   that the resulting diagnosis networks show disassortative mixing by
   degree, suggesting that patients affected by a small number of diseases
   tend to suffer from prevalent diseases. Factors that determine the
   network structures include an individual's age, gender and ethnicity.
   Our analysis on network evolution further shows that patients and
   diseases become more interconnected over the illness duration of SMI,
   which is largely driven by the process that patients with similar
   attributes tend to suffer from the same conditions. Our analytic
   approach provides a guide for future patient-centric research on
   multimorbidity trajectories and contributes to achieving precision
   medicine.},

Title = {A Systematic Approach to Identify and Manage Interface Risks between
   Project Stakeholders in Construction Projects},
Journal = {CIVILENG},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-118},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Interface risks are inherent in every construction project from start to
   finish. Identifying and managing these risks effectively in every
   project phase is crucial for actualising project objectives. This paper
   shows a comprehensive framework showing several relationships between
   project stakeholders and how the interface risks between them that
   influence project execution are identified and managed for the overall
   construction project success. Firstly, a literature review on interfaces
   and interface risks and a discussion on how organisations managed
   interface risks were carried out, and secondly, the collection of
   quantitative data was conducted by means of structured online
   questionnaires. The sample consisted of 205 construction project
   professionals who were selected randomly. This group included
   individuals with various roles in the construction industry. The data
   were analysed using descriptive statistical methods, including factor
   analysis, reliability assessment, and calculations of frequencies and
   percentages. The results showed all the factors, work cultures, and
   organisational approaches that influence interface risk management and
   ways to identify and manage interface risks effectively. Effective
   stakeholder management is crucial for effective interface risk
   management since many interface risks are created by the numerous
   stakeholders involved in the project and the proposed frameworks will
   effectively mitigate the consequences and causes of interface risks.
   Effectively mitigating these risks involves effective stakeholder
   management, building information modelling volume strategy, and creating
   a virtual construction model during the construction phase; in addition,
   construction supply chain risks must be carefully identified during the
   interfaces establishment stages; interface risks must be carefully
   identified during the conceptualisation; and the planning, construction,
   and execution stages and standard methods and procedures must be defined
   to effectively identify and manage interface risks as the occur in the
   project lifecycle plus implementing the proposed risk mitigation
   frameworks.},

Title = {A comprehensive analysis of the benefits of integrated digital delivery
   in construction projects},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Purpose - Integrated digital delivery (IDD) is the use of digital
   technologies, data, and platforms to integrate work processes and
   connect all stakeholders working on the same project throughout the
   construction and building lifecycle. The benefits of digital
   technologies are often cited to justify the adoption of IDD in
   construction projects, but such benefits remain under-researched and
   unverified. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the performance
   improvements attributable to the IDD approach in construction projects.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study combined questionnaire surveys,
   statistical analysis, social network analysis, and fuzzy synthetic
   evaluation to investigate the benefits of IDD in Hong Kong construction
   projects. The methodology was applied to rank the benefits of IDD,
   assess the benefit categories of the IDD, and model the relationships
   between the benefits. Findings - The results showed twenty-two (22)
   significant benefits of the IDD approach, grouped into design, cost,
   collaboration, sustainability, procurement, and productivity benefits.
   Design and collaboration benefits were ranked at the top and ``high
   quality and faster preparation of designs{''} and ``improved information
   exchange and management{''} were the most important benefits in these
   clusters, respectively. The weighted network model showed that the
   benefits of IDD are significantly correlated, and ``cost savings
   associated with digital project delivery{''}, ``improved work and
   project quality{''}, and ``high quality and faster preparation of
   designs and calculation{''} were identified as the most influential
   benefits. Originality/value - The study outcomes offer the first
   empirical insights into performance gains achievable with the IDD
   approach in construction projects. Hence, this study, for the first
   time, identified and assessed the benefits and benefit categories as
   well as formulating the relationships between the benefits to suggest
   the most effective benefit pipeline.},

Title = {New shipyard layout design for the preliminary phase \& case study for

Abstract = {For several decades, Asian nations such as Korea, Japan and China have
   been leading the shipbuilding industry since the decline in Europe and
   America. However, several developing countries such as India, Brazil,
   etc. are going to make an entrance into the shipbuilding industry. These
   developing countries are finding technical partners or information
   providers because they are in situation of little experiences and
   technologies. Now, the shipbuilding engineering companies of
   shzpbuilding advanced countries are getting a chance of engineering
   business against those developing countries. The starting point of this
   business model is green field project for the construction of new
   shipyard. This business model is started with a design of the shipyard
   layout. For the conducting of the shipyard layout design, four kinds of
   engineering parts are required Those are civil engineering, building
   engineering, utility engineering and production layout engineering.
   Among these parts, production layout engineering is most important
   because its result is the foundation of the other engineering parts and
   it determines the shipyard capacity during the shipyard operation
   lifecycle. Previous researches about the shipyard layout design are out
   of the range from the business requirements because most research cases
   are in the tower of ivory, which means that there are little
   consideration of real ship and shipbuilding operation. In this paper, a
   shipyard layout design for preliminary phase is conducted for the target
   of newly planned shipyard at Venezuela of South America with an
   integrated method that is capable of dealing with actual master data
   from the shipyard The layout design method of this paper is
   differentiated from the previous researches in that the actual product
   data from the target ship and the actual shipbuilding operation data are

Abstract = {Marketing performance measurement is important in retail companies, it
   is critical for the budget planning and adjustment of marketing
   strategies and tactics over time. Compared to digital online marketing,
   such as social media advertisers where tagging techniques {[}1] can be
   applied to track the lifecycle of the consumption and the customer's
   behaviours, traditional TV and radio advertising will be harder to
   evaluate at the individual level. Instead, common approach in this
   scenario is to study the relationship between ads spend and sales. This
   paper presents a casual inference methodology - ``Difference in
   Differences{''}(DID) on the application of TV marketing measurement.
   Instead of building direct relationship between ads and sales, we
   attempt to create an experimental research design and study the
   differential effect on a `treatment group' versus a `control group'. In
   order to study the performance of advertising in a city, the treatment
   group is sales performance during and after TV advertisings and the
   control group is the statistical model that mimics the sales of the same
   city without ads influence. It is proved that the model can
   significantly predict the sales of city in nature by considering its
   past sales, the neighbourhood districts and weather conditions. And a
   case study in industrial data shows that DID methodology can effectively
   evaluate the TV advertising results on regions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {This paper will present the importance of the exterior design of books
   based on the needs of the visually impaired population. Based on the
   theories of book design, this paper will discuss about whether there is
   a need to focus on the exterior design of such books in real life and
   how to realize such design in order to achieve the consistency between
   the content and exterior form of such books. Meanwhile, this paper is
   expected to promote the study of book design for the disadvantaged.
   Books as a carrier of information transmission, more and more people
   become an indispensable part of daily life, especially in today's
   information age, there are plenty of books appear in front of us,
   concept books, electronic books, audio books, jumped out to challenge
   the traditional paper books, and so on from a technical means and
   different forms, special material and technology development trend to
   reflect the diversity of the books, in order to reveal the present rich
   and colorful art books, embodies the aesthetic and the pursuit of the
   vast number of people in this world. Usually, people in choosing a book
   is often decided by external form its purchase, collection, this also
   led to ignore the integrity of the internal structure of books, we can
   see from this form for the role of books in the ideology of people
   occupy the main determinants, and guides people's subjective judgment,
   and the understanding and evaluation of book design just stay on the
   pattern of beauty in appearance, and people also see to promote these
   new books to the form of excessive attention, so the content and form of
   relationship seems to be in a vague definition. Mr Lu jingren referred
   to in the ``calligraphic art asks:{''} books design is a kind of
   ``tectonics{''} is to build the external books formative physical ideas
   and rational thinking on the inner information of comprehensive
   knowledge, after the designer accurately grasp the content would then
   understanding of the subject from perceptual initiation, savvy and
   intellectual and overall, and after careful calculation, elaborate
   structure and logistically of rhythm and process steps such as organized
   and orderly construct designers' construct `{''} in the heart. Books
   design, therefore, is to build a whole structure, the concept of form a
   complete books are supposed to be external modelling of the structure of
   the building as well as the internal thoughts of emotional rendering,
   both through the analysis of rational conveys the connotation of books,
   finally to achieve the perfect fusion of books to read aesthetic and
   function, so that the content and form, art and function to achieve
   unification.
   So many books as designers started to explore in the field of theory and
   practice of these problems, will rise to the definition of the overall
   book design level, no longer the superficial appearance, to interpret
   the concept of overall structure, contents and forms of the dialectical
   relationship between the theory and practice together throughout the
   entire process of design, the design theory of ``functional{''} seems to
   play the biggest role here, lead the books design changes, thus in the
   great majority of the population of concern books design should not only
   have the beautiful external form, have coordinated with the internal
   emotional thought, the content of the book to the external form, the
   unity of form and content reflect the beauty of the books of the whole
   and the overall design concept of the trinity.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of ontic dispositions of modern
   reality. The modern reality is the post-, smart-, cyber-reality of the
   modern semi-artificial semi-living post-human cyborg. Imperatives that
   have been funding the cultural and ontic space of man for thousands of
   years, such as pain, fear, desire for pleasure, death, etc., are no
   longer in the zone of the sacred or metaphysical, but rather in the
   sphere of planned and pragmatically oriented technology. Modern cluster
   and virtual-based construction of the living world format the world
   around according to the patterns of information space, in which both
   time and space, technological or production chains, social ties, models
   of interaction and existence are formed in a smart and post-temporal and
   spatial paradigm that deconstructs the classical models of time, space
   and cultural environment as a whole. In the modern cultural environment
   and, accordingly, in the ontic space of the post-human cyborg, the logic
   of building a medial virtual-digital reality is incorporated. The
   article provides a cultural-philosophical and hermeneutical analysis of
   the main provisions of the new ontic space of modernity (logic of
   ``logistics{''}, binarism, ``logic of order{''}). It is shown that in
   the virtual and digital life world there is a transformation of personal
   parameters: structures of thinking, patterns of behavior, as well as
   ways of self-identification. To describe this phenomenon, the term
   ``digital identity{''} is proposed, and its characteristics are given:
   foundation by virtual-digital means, dematerialization of relationships
   and actions, prosthetics by network organs, subjective non-autonomy and
   obedience to orders. The authors draw conclusions about the nature and
   essential features of the posthuman cyborg as a natural product of the
   new virtual digital reality.},

Abstract = {The human-centric philosophy is considered a crucial development
   direction for smart Product-Service Systems (smart PSS). Smart PSS has
   effectively advanced the circular economy by enhancing user experience,
   incorporating servitization and digital servitization, and extending
   product lifecycle, among other key aspects of sustainable development.
   However, there is currently a lack of a reasonable, accurate, and
   actionable framework and methodology to express the human element,
   namely user profiling, within this philosophy. To address this gap, this
   paper utilizes statistical methods such as factor analysis, cluster
   analysis, and regression analysis, building upon the concept of
   traditional user profiling. The aim is to integrate the three prominent
   approaches of goal-oriented, scenario-based, and data-driven user
   profiling, with the goal of complementing each other and designing a
   top-level user profiling framework for smart PSS. Furthermore, Industry
   4.0 technologies and text mining techniques are employed to collect data
   on users ` product and service usage. As these data contain realtime
   information about user needs, behaviors and goals at different time
   periods, they can be used to construct dynamic features of user
   profiling, and ultimately achieve the construction of dynamic user
   profiling for smart PSS. To validate the proposed user profiling
   framework and dynamic user features of smart PSS, this paper presents a
   case study focusing on the user group of maternal women. This case study
   promotes the in-depth exploration of smart PSS research in expressing
   the human element.},

Title = {Assessing Accessibility and Social Equity of Tertiary Hospitals for
   Older Adults: A City-Wide Study of Tianjin, China},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building age-friendly cities with good accessibility and social equity
   can help improve older adults' well-being and quality of life. However,
   current accessibility analysis of service facilities tends to target
   most general users, while few studies have been conducted regarding
   hospitals from an age-friendly perspective. This study aims to measure
   accessibility to tertiary hospitals and conduct its equity analysis for
   older adults aged 65 years or over. First, the gravity-based model and
   geographic information system are utilized to measure accessibility to
   tertiary hospitals within regions and across regions, and the overall
   accessibility of a region. Second, coefficient of variation and global
   Moran's I are adopted to investigate differences in accessibility to
   tertiary hospitals by type among regions. Third, Lorenz curves and Gini
   coefficients are employed to analyze social equity of access to medical
   services for the elderly. Taking Tianjin, China as the case study, the
   results show that there exist spatial clusters in terms of accessibility
   to tertiary hospitals within districts, across districts, and of the
   whole district. Most districts in the city center have better access to
   these hospitals than the peripheral and suburban districts. The social
   equity of accessibility to tertiary hospitals is slightly better in the
   senior population than in the total population. This study can help the
   governments improve the spatial distribution and allocation of urban
   health care resources in a more equitable manner and promote the
   development of age-friendly cities in future.},

Title = {INTEROPERABILITY IN AECO AND THE OIL \& GAS SECTORS: OBJECT-BASED
   STANDARDS AND SYSTEMS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {312-334},
Abstract = {This research proposes recommendations that could improve
   interoperability in the architecture, engineering, construction and
   operations (AECO) sector, by connecting domains, building lifecycles,
   and software systems with each other and the web. The objective has been
   to identify methods that promote evolution from filebased formats by
   advancing object-based data exchange solutions. The research design is a
   mapping of standards and systems that have affected the nature of
   object-based data exchanges, and which have either been proposed or
   implemented in AECO and the Oil \& Gas sector. This is an approach which
   allows for the range and diversity of information to be examined. A
   review of the Oil \& Gas sector confirms a norm where object-based,
   rather than file-based, transactions have shaped data exchange models,
   formats, use case methodologies, and collaboration mechanisms, thus
   contributing towards semantic connectivity across its diverse systems.
   Key research questions address the nature of these sectors, the promise
   that object-based data exchange offers, and examine recommendations that
   would improve standards and systems. The paper affirms that measures
   taken to improve interoperability in the Oil \& Gas sector have
   relevance for the AECO sector, and that better understanding, and
   recognition of the structure of AECOs interoperability ecosystem is
   central to effecting lasting and significant change. Thus, we make
   recommendations that acknowledge the hybrid nature of AECO data
   exchanges and propose an interoperability ecosystem that connects both
   distributed and centralised federated models. Improved standards to
   define application programming interfaces (APIs) and adaptors, based on
   a modular approach, would be central to this proposal. We also make
   recommendations to improve use case definitions, and to ensure that
   semantic connectivity at the object level is scalable to web-based
   transactions. Finally, we assert that, to realise these changes, the
   developers and vendors of its systems should recognise and address the
   AECO sector's pressing needs and concerns.},

Abstract = {How do Estonians imagine themselves as a nation? According to a popular
   Estonian essayist, a proper Estonian digs his garden on Mondays and
   mines his bitcoins on Tuesdays. This article focuses on Estonian
   imaginaries to study the grounding structures of Estonian
   identity-creation in the 2010s and it articulates the core of a
   canonized understanding of Estonian identity as ``eco-digital
   nationhood.{''} The article explores Estonia's eco-digital national
   model as produced by an aesthetic screening, supported by a Western gaze
   adapted for local purposes of positive identity creation. In Estonia,
   international approval (for its reputation as a digital nation) has
   fostered a national self-image of living in a digital state.
   Technological advancement combined with idealizations of natural
   environments have sometimes produced ``eco-ambiguous{''} results, as in
   efforts to encounter nonhuman life-worlds without leaving one's own
   comfort zone. In other instances, the eco and the digital function as
   two alternating modes of selfhood, the eco-part sometimes finding
   expression in the narratives of ethnic particularism, the digital part
   figuring Estonia as a herald of western modernism prudently adapting
   itself to the digital future. Discrepancies between the eco-digital
   imaginary and the many less flattering elements of Estonian actuality
   highlight selective (self-)representative strategies in narratives of
   national success. Nation building here emerges as a metonymic process,
   wherein certain parts of culture are foregrounded to represent the
   whole-while other parts, including substantial parts of the Soviet
   heritage (material, demographic, social, psychological) languish as
   unsuitable to be framed.},

Abstract = {The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has created
   a transculturalized diabetes chronic disease care model that is adapted
   for patients across a spectrum of ethnicities and cultures. AACE has
   conducted several transcultural activities on global issues in clinical
   endocrinology and completed a 3-city series of conferences in December
   2017 that focused on diabetes care for ethnic minorities in the U.S.
   Proceedings from the ``Diabetes Care Across America{''} series of
   transcultural summits are presented here. Information from community
   leaders, practicing health care professionals, and other stakeholders in
   diabetes care is analyzed according to biological and environmental
   factors. Four specific U.S. ethnicities are detailed: African Americans,
   Latino/Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. A core set of
   recommendations to culturally adapt diabetes care is presented that
   emphasizes culturally appropriate terminology, transculturalization of
   white papers, culturally adapting clinic infrastructure, flexible office
   hours, behavioral medicine- especially motivational interviewing and
   building trust- culturally competent nutritional messaging and health
   literacy, community partnerships for care delivery, technology
   innovation, clinical trial recruitment and retention of ethnic
   minorities, and more funding for scientific studies on epigenetic
   mechanisms of cultural impact on disease expression. It is hoped that
   through education, research, and clinical practice enhancements,
   diabetes care can be optimized in terms of precision and clinical
   outcomes for the individual and U.S. population as a whole.},

Abstract = {The course taken by the Russian state to form and develop an innovative
   economy should significantly expand the development potential of
   society, which is reflected in the efficiency and quality of economic
   processes and characterizes the social orientation of the country.
   Improving the level and standard of life of the society as a whole plays
   the corresponding role in the model of economic development where the
   innovation component dominates. As evidenced in practice, the current
   state of the economy of any country in the world is characterized
   primarily by the level and standard of citizens' lives. Indicators of
   the population's standard of life are the most important indicators for
   assessing the real socio-economic effects of the transformations and the
   degree of social tension in society. Achieving the highest possible
   standard of life for the country's population is a priority task for the
   socially-oriented economy of modern Russia.Currently, the executive
   authorities in Russia do not draw a clear distinction between the
   notions of the level and standard of life of the population, presenting
   official information on the group of ``The Level of Life{''} indicators.
   The problem of improving the standard of life of the population is the
   most important strategic task of the development of the society at the
   current stage, which has determined the relevance of the research topic.
   The study of the concept of ``quality of life{''} in the modern economy
   of the Russian Federation allowed the authors to analyze the elements of
   an economic and social nature. Based on the available statistical data,
   the authors proposed directions to improve the quality of life of the
   population of the Russian Federation in modern economic conditions, and
   also provided a predictive assessment of the dynamics of changes in the
   main socio-economic indicators.The article deals with the actual problem
   of improving the standard of life of Russian people through implementing
   the priority areas for the development and modernization of healthcare,
   education, housing and demographic policies, presents an analysis of the
   definition of ``the standard of life{''} and its indicators, as well as
   the forecast study of socio-economic indicators. A theoretical approach
   to the formation of a people-oriented economy based on the innovation
   basis is proposed. It was concluded that in order to improve the
   standard of life of the population and overcome the differences in the
   socio-economic situation of the population having limited budgetary
   resources, the task of building a market economy that has a social focus
   is of particular importance.},

   Decentralized Applications in the Built Environment},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) can enable distributed collaboration,
   enhance data sharing, and automate back-end processes for digital twin
   (DT) decentralized applications (dApps) in the construction industry
   (CI) 4.0. The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture
   and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based
   digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI
   4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research
   interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems,
   functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to
   be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to
   design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the
   lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to
   identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software
   architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for
   developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings
   were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT
   dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related
   FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were
   designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT
   architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on
   blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed
   BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main
   requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the
   non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart
   contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry
   problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study
   also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching
   dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared
   the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed
   smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized
   building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of
   criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT
   applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks'
   properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and
   interoperability). Finally, this study resulted in a novel framework
   that included software architecture, smart-contract use cases, and
   selection criteria among blockchain networks for BCDT dApps in CI 4.0.},

Title = {Enhanced project brief: structured approach to client-designer interface},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {474-492},
Abstract = {Purpose - The focus of this work is on the client-designer interface
   where decisions have significant impact over the lifecycle of the
   project. Therefore, the briefing stage is examined in the context of
   clients' needs which is divided into project-based strategy and broader
   clients' strategy. The purpose of this paper is to address the pitfalls
   in the briefing process which has been attributed to the shortcomings in
   the client-designer communication interfaces. This will be achieved by
   developing an automated brief generation framework. The research
   examines the efficiency of standard approaches to modelling and design,
   and the benefits that these methodologies have offered to the computer
   industry. The work reviews the similarities between the two industries
   and argues in support of the potential benefits in adopting a standard
   methodology in the construction industry. The structure upon which the
   framework is developed is based on system analysis and design
   methodology (SSADM) which has proven to be an effective platform used
   within the software development industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - SSADM is an established methodology within
   the software development industry. The paper will demonstrate that due
   to fundamental similarities between the construction and software
   development industries, SSADM is likely to offer a viable platform upon
   which an automated enhanced brief generation model is developed for use
   in the construction industry. The construction design and construction
   process will be mapped on SSADM high-level definition before focusing
   and honing on the design phase. The methodology for the development of
   the framework will be based on the rationalist approach of generating
   knowledge through reasoning leading to model-building.
   Findings - A model that is based on SSADM is proposed for the design
   development phase of construction projects. In order to shape the
   project strategy, the model considers the combined role of clients'
   requirements with organisation strategy and environmental factors. The
   paper has shown that it is feasible to increase the automation of the
   briefing process and enhanced the briefing output. The model here does
   not diminish the importance of direct communication between the client
   and the design team. It provides a more structured way of doing so,
   while taking advantage of vast array of data and technology in order to
   improve the brief outcome.
   Research limitations/implications - From practical perspective, the
   proposed framework is in its formative stage, thus requiring incremental
   refinement through several case studies. This is particularly true about
   the AI components of the system which typically rely on extensive data
   representing the real-case scenarios. Therefore, the work invites
   further research into the examination of various parts as well as the
   overall system.
   Practical implications - There are several ways by which construction
   projects are procured. There may be fluctuation in their rate of usage,
   but while there is no indication of any procurement option fading, new
   ones such as PPP and PFI are periodically introduced. The existence of
   this diversity is indicative of the fact that the industry tends to
   respond to problems rather than attempting to instigate a measured
   solution supported by theoretical underpinning. Subsequently, there have
   been suggestions of a communication and information discourse between
   actors and within processes involved in project lifecycle. This project
   is aimed at addressing the gap in the client-designer communication. The
   automated approach to brief generation will lead to better briefs while
   reducing ambiguities as well as the overhead associated with brief
   generation.
   Social implications - The quality of project brief has a significant
   impact on decisions at the design stage. In turn, these decisions will
   influence all phases of construction project lifecycle. The briefing
   session and requirement analysis of a construction project can be very
   difficult for inexperienced clients particularly for complex projects.
   Therefore, there is potential for the process of
   client-requirement-analysis to be optimised. The work promises to
   improve the quality of the briefing process, thus helping clients to
   realise their intended objectives and minimise resource waste.
   Originality/value - The work builds on the commonalities of the
   construction and software development industries and takes advantage of
   the advancements in the latter. In doing so, project quality is defined
   quantitatively which is used to develop project strategy in a
   three-dimensional space. The development of the model was also
   contingent upon enhancement of artificial neural network structure.},

Title = {A machine learning approach for performance-oriented decision support in

Abstract = {Enterprise IT performance can be improved by providing reactive and
   predictive monitoring tools that anticipate problem detection. It
   requires advanced approaches for creating more agile, adaptable,
   sustainable and intelligent information systems. Service-oriented
   architecture (SOA) has been used in significant performance-based
   approaches by information system practitioners. Organizations are
   interested in performance-based decision support along the layers of SOA
   to maintain their sustainability for service reuse. Reusability is a
   very important aspect of Service-based systems (SBS) to analyze service
   or process reuse. This helps in achieving business agility to meet
   changing marketplace needs. However currently, there are many challenges
   pertaining tothe complexities of service reuse evolution along SBS.
   These challenges are related to the sustainability of service behavior
   during its lifecycle and the limitations of existing monitoring tools.
   There is a need for a consolidated classified knowledge-based
   performance profile, analytical assessment, prediction and
   recommendation. Therefore, this paper provides a semantic
   performance-oriented decision support system (SPODSS) for SOA. SPODSS
   provides recommendations for suggesting service reuse during its
   evolution. SPODSS is supported by five building blocks. These blocks are
   data, semantic, traces, machine learning, and decision. SPODSS classify
   data, validate (analytical assessment, traces, semantic enrichment) at
   different time intervals and increased consumption and prediction based
   on consolidated results. It handles the dynamic evolution of SBS and new
   or changed user requirements by ontology development. Finally, SPODSS
   generates recommendations for atomic service, composite service, and
   resourceallocation provisioning. To motivate this approach, we
   illustrate the implementation of the proposed algorithms for all the
   five blocks by a business process use case and public data set
   repositories of shared services. Sustainability and adaptability of
   service-based systems areensured by handling new business requirements,
   dynamicity issues and ensuring performance. Performance criterion
   includes functional suitability, time behavior, resource utilization,
   and reliability in terms of availability, maturity, and risk.},

Title = {Genome Evolution and the Future of Phylogenomics of Non-Avian Reptiles},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Non-avian reptiles comprise a large proportion of amniote vertebrate
   diversity, with squamate reptiles-lizards and snakes-recently overtaking
   birds as the most species-rich tetrapod radiation. Despite displaying an
   extraordinary diversity of phenotypic and genomic traits, genomic
   resources in non-avian reptiles have accumulated more slowly than they
   have in mammals and birds, the remaining amniotes. Here we review the
   remarkable natural history of non-avian reptiles, with a focus on the
   physical traits, genomic characteristics, and sequence compositional
   patterns that comprise key axes of variation across amniotes. We argue
   that the high evolutionary diversity of non-avian reptiles can fuel a
   new generation of whole-genome phylogenomic analyses. A survey of
   phylogenetic investigations in non-avian reptiles shows that sequence
   capture-based approaches are the most commonly used, with studies of
   markers known as ultraconserved elements (UCEs) especially well
   represented. However, many other types of markers exist and are
   increasingly being mined from genome assemblies in silico, including
   some with greater information potential than UCEs for certain
   investigations. We discuss the importance of high-quality genomic
   resources and methods for bioinformatically extracting a range of marker
   sets from genome assemblies. Finally, we encourage herpetologists
   working in genomics, genetics, evolutionary biology, and other fields to
   work collectively towards building genomic resources for non-avian
   reptiles, especially squamates, that rival those already in place for
   mammals and birds. Overall, the development of this crossamniote
   phylogenomic tree of life will contribute to illuminate interesting
   dimensions of biodiversity across non-avian reptiles and broader
   amniotes.},

Title = {The transition to the circular economy of the construction industry:
   Insights into sustainable approaches to improve the understanding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {364},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {In the context of shifting the built environment to a circular economy,
   this paper first provides a meta-synthesis of the literature that
   clarifies the strategies related to the asset lifecycle in the circular
   economy (CE) context. The definitions of forty-two approaches,
   classified into seven categories (A to G) were analysed to identify
   their differences and similarities using a text mining method.Based on
   the definitions, approaches', their needs and requirements, and their
   benefits and impacts have been listed. Four variables have been
   identified: the asset phases (V1), the sustainable approaches (V2), the
   benefits and impacts (V3) and the needs and requirements (V4). As the
   main contribution to knowledge, two diagrams have been drawn to picture
   the relationships between, first, V1, V2 and V3 and secondly V1, V2 and
   V4. An additional contribution is semantic information captured and
   drawn in a Force Directed Graph (FDG) to clarify the diversity of
   existing approaches and their relationships. More than a hundred
   approaches/concepts are staged in a diagram and their links are
   identified. Particularly the importance of the design phase and its
   related approaches are developed. The FDG illustrates the complexity of
   the building projects involving multiple stakeholders.The paper also
   provides the limitations of the variety of approaches that should be
   overcome to achieve CE. In particular, the limitations of reuse
   (components cannot be reused indefinitely) and limitations of
   design-only approaches (like prefabrication where deconstruction is not
   prepared). Further research is recommended about the Product Service
   Systems associated with Extended Producer Responsibility that appears to
   be key enablers for the CE. Work is also needed to define the
   circularity of buildings and the associated circularity assessment
   tools. The outputs could be used to rationalise policies to foster these
   approaches to enable the construction sector to develop strategies to
   overcome the current obstacles to the transition to a circular economy.},

Abstract = {PurposeIn today's global and competitive corporate environment
   characterised by rapidly changing information, knowledge and technology
   (IKT), researchers must be upskilled in all aspects of research data
   management (RDM). This study investigates a set of capabilities and
   competencies required by researchers at selected South African public
   universities, using the community capability model framework (CCMF) in
   conjunction with the digital curation centre (DCC) lifecycle
   model.Design/methodology/approachThe post-positivist paradigm was used
   in the study, which used both qualitative and quantitative
   methodologies. Case studies, both qualitative and quantitative, were
   used as research methods. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic rules and
   regulations, semi-structured interviews with 23 study participants were
   conducted online via Microsoft Teams to collect qualitative data, and
   questionnaires were converted into Google Forms and emailed to 30
   National Research Foundation (NRF)-rated researchers to collect
   quantitative data.FindingsParticipating institutions are still in the
   initial stages of providing RDM services. Most researchers are unaware
   of how long their institutions retain research data, and they store and
   backup their research data on personal computers, emails and external
   storage devices. Data management, research methodology, data curation,
   metadata skills and technical skills are critically important RDM
   competency requirements for both staff and researchers. Adequate
   infrastructure, as well as human resources and capital, are in short
   supply. There are no specific capacity-building programmes or strategies
   for developing RDM skills at the moment, and a lack of data curation
   skills is a major challenge in providing RDM.Practical implicationsThe
   findings of the study can be applied widely in research, teaching and
   learning. Furthermore, the research could help shape RDM strategy and
   policy in South Africa and elsewhere.Originality/valueThe scope, subject
   matter and application of this study contribute to its originality and
   novelty.},

Journal = {JAMIA OPEN},

Volume = {3},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective: Healthcare systems have adopted electronic health records
   (EHRs) to support clinical care. Providing patient-centered care (PCC)
   is a goal of many healthcare systems. In this study, we sought to
   explore how existing EHR systems support PCC; defined as understanding
   the patient as a whole person, building relational connections between
   the clinician and patient, and supporting patients in health
   self-management.
   Materials and Methods: We assessed availability of EHR functions
   consistent with providing PCC including patient goals and preferences,
   integrated care plans, and contextual and patient-generated data. We
   surveyed and then interviewed technical representatives and expert
   clinical users of 6 leading EHR systems. Questions focused on the
   availability of specific data and functions related to PCC (for
   technical representatives) and the clinical usefulness of PCC functions
   (for clinicians) in their EHR.
   Results: Technical representatives (n = 6) reported that patient
   communication preferences, personalized indications for medications, and
   end of life preferences were functions implemented across 6 systems.
   Clinician users (n = 10) reported moderate usefulness of PCC functions
   (medians of 2-4 on a 5-pointy -35t scale), suggesting the potential for
   improvement across systems. Interviews revealed that clinicians do not
   have a shared conception of PCC. In many cases, data needed to deliver
   PCC was available in the EHR only in unstructured form. Data systems and
   functionality to support PCC are under development in these EHRs.
   Discussion and Conclusion: There are current gaps in PCC functionality
   in EHRs and opportunities to support the practice of PCC through EHR
   redesign.},

Abstract = {We live in an era of unprecedented technology. Millions of users depend
   on information technology to carry out their daily lives and large-scale
   commercial and industrial operations are no exception. At the same time,
   the rapidly growing interconnectivity of IT systems and the surge in
   cybercrime since the pandemic have rendered industry-standard hardware
   and software components increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks.
   Cyber defense is a coordinated act of resistance that intends to
   understand the capabilities and motives of attackers in order to secure
   our country's data and more importantly, the livelihoods of our
   citizens. This research aims to contribute to the progress of
   cybersecurity and defense technology as a whole by focusing on a dynamic
   aspect of malware: digital unwanted advertisements. It presents a novel
   approach to automating the analysis of malicious content on the internet
   by web scraping ads of the popular search engine Google to extract
   relevant data (URL, Company, Title, Product Desc.), building machine
   learning models (supervised \& unsupervised) to classify and make
   predictions on that data, and creating a web application for end users
   to access. The results show that our tool can detect trends within the
   features with limited false positives, paving the way for us to make
   predictions on whether the advertisements are desirable or unwanted. The
   research concludes that in this time and age, it is extremely important
   to protect against fraud, especially by adhering to cybersecurity's best
   practices and to think about threats in more global terms. Our hope with
   this research is to prompt action to ensure society continues to improve
   in IT resilience.},

Abstract = {Water is a fundamental resource for human life and nature; flood
   management, water supply systems and water protection policies are a few
   examples of equally important disciplines across the whole hydrological
   cycle. The present work focuses on the creation and sharing of
   hydrological knowledge within public activities, with regard to
   materials and methods adopted for developing and supplying hydrological
   information, suitable to different stakeholders needs, throughout
   different disciplines and sectors of environment, economy, society, as
   well as research and analysis. The aim of this work is to better
   understand the market in order to increase the value of hydrological
   data, products and services, and to reduce potential gaps and
   overlapping areas. The method we developed is based on the example of
   the Hydrological Service of Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. Institutional,
   legal and territorial frameworks as well as agency organization,
   materials, methods, instruments, activities, products and results are
   briefly described, focusing on those supporting civil and environmental
   protection, water management, infrastructure design, climate change
   adaptation and mitigation measures. We discuss the role of a public
   Administration in interdisciplinary activities, the links between the
   general background (e.g., territory, society, rules), organizations,
   actors, resources, tools, processes and results, by highlighting, where
   possible, a potential starting point for future research studies.
   Finally, this paper adopts a novel linguistic style, based on an
   informal format, in order to explore the set-up and follow-up of the
   Hydrological Service's initiatives, with the final aim of sparking
   curiosity and building awareness, from different sectors and
   disciplines, which, ultimately, may benefit from the presented
   approaches.},

Abstract = {The chaotic and dynamic nature of heat transfer results is either
   time-consuming or inaccurate predictions of the temperature field in
   simulations. In particular, the simulation of burning buildings is
   complex and at the same time the key enabler in saving lives and keeping
   property damage to a minimum. Deep Learning Neural Networks are a
   possibility to speed up the simulation process and make real-time
   predictions of temperature behavior or even replace the simulation
   process as a whole in the long run.
   This paper proposes a novel procedure to create a convolutional neural
   network-based method CNN1D3D, that is capable of approximating the
   behavior of temperature in burning rooms. The data used for training is
   created with time intensive, numerical simulations. CNN1D3D's
   architecture consists of an convolution-based temporal and spatial
   encoding as well of a transposed convolution based decoder, that creates
   temperature predictions in real-time.
   The work shows a possibility for a distinct feature extraction for
   temporal and spatial features. It shows how solutions generated by
   simulations based on differential equations hold implicitly the
   necessary information needed for the method to recreate the context of
   the data set. This forms a basis for the abstraction onto further fluid
   dynamics applications. This work has several real-world applications and
   forms the basis for future rescue route calculations. The solution can
   be generalized on other applications with similar data structures. It
   provides the opportunity to capture the complexity of interdependencies
   and correlations in the field of fluid dynamics. Copyright (c) 2024 The

Title = {Envisioning a strategic framework to streamline building operation,
   sustainability and users' disease control},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-227},

Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to present a strategic framework aiming to streamline
   building operation and sustainability issues. To make available a
   further contribution to respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
   an operational prevention guideline relying on the level of spread risk
   has also been developed, primarily intended for users when accessing and
   circulating within common spaces of buildings in general.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research approach involved the development of a whole theory,
   essentially based on a qualitative design, by means of tree schematic
   representations and explanatory frames. It presents part of a model
   already developed (called SIAPME), although, in general, besides
   integrating the underlying aspects of the individual experience of daily
   life, it is based on insights and impressions taken from the literature
   review.
   Findings
   With an identity of its own, this study offers an overview of an
   alternative set of well-founded and integrated strategies to improve
   working processes in a number of fields of the building operation
   function. A structured vision has thus, been provided with interest in
   certain key topics of the present time, such as energy management,
   comfort and sustainability. Still, in this context, based on a frame of
   knowledge gathered to date, a current, innovative and simple guidance
   has also been designed to help prevent the contagion of COVID-19.
   Research limitations/implications
   The draft of procedures is part of an ambitious goal to serve as a
   well-founded strategic basis for the eventual development of an advanced
   software solution. As it is mainly limited to qualitative analysis, from
   which themes and generalisations have been arranged, this research may
   need more empirical evidence and additional work will be necessary to
   overcome any gaps that may be found.
   Practical implications
   An overall assessment of this study seems to corroborate the idea that a
   significant impact on the developments in building operation can occur
   if stakeholders seek a more integrated way of management, based on
   cross-referencing of current issues. At a time when great uncertainties
   remain and knowledge advances are in full swing, the designed framework
   aims to be an added input towards already existing research.
   Furthermore, it can be seen as a valuable contribution to improving
   related software applications.
   Originality/value
   The originality lies in trying to better understand how and in which
   aspects the general day-to-day management of building operation can be
   handled more effectively, sustainable and framed, following a reasoned
   scientific line, in addition of trying to figure out greater capacity to
   deal with users' contagions, especially in the existing context of the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Palazzo Ducale in Mantua is an emblematic case of complex architecture,
   in which the current configuration is the result of centuries of
   additions, modifications and substitutions. The understanding of
   buildings with such a degree of complexity is very difficult and
   requires, most of the time, a specialized training. Nevertheless, this
   understanding is also the necessary tool to recognizing the real value,
   not only architectural but also cultural, historic and documentary of
   Gonzagas' complex. This research project tries to build new forms of
   communication that will enable the non-specialist public to grasp the
   complexity of the Gonzaga palace. So it is necessary to merge the
   wellestablished languages with innovative elements that allow a clear
   and immediate reading. The maquette or plastic is one of the tools that
   best accomplishes this task. The model speaks an easy to understand
   language, by entrusting it to the common visual experience. Therefore,
   there is no need to use special regulations or specialized languages as
   in the architectural drawing. The plastic is also an interesting surface
   to represent other themes. In this case, the model allows to acquire two
   levels of information. At first, it is possible to recognize the shape
   of the architectural complex through an overall view, that of the
   observer the plastic, which, in reality, is accessible only by air. It
   appears impossible to recognize the complex in the same view of the
   Castle of San Giorgio along with Santa Barbara and the Domus Nova. The
   second content is given by light-mapping on the surface of the model.
   The different configurations of the Palazzo during the centuries are
   projected onto the plastic to let public understand immediately which
   building belongs to each historical period. The other communication tool
   that complements the plastic is the imagery. The images play an
   important role in the project as a form of projection; it enriches the
   information supplied by the plastic. In this project, we want to
   emphasize the extraordinary experience of the visitor to the discovery
   of the historical evolution of the building through a large projection
   on three walls. The visitor is surrounded in a virtual environment. In
   the center, there is the plastic and all images-movies are projected on
   the perimeter walls: they add details to the story of the historical
   development. The layout of the entire hall, the main entrance to the
   inside of the environment, wants to emphasize the exceptional nature of
   the experience and, at the same time, focus on the described elements.
   The third element that completes the communication project is the
   story-telling that implies the whole experience. Because the
   communication is effective, it has abandoned communication style of the
   documentary, embracing the metaphor of the story in the first person.
   Each visitor will feel guided in the visit by a well-built character and
   really identified. The figure chosen to accompany the discovery of the
   Doge's Palace draws directly to the history of Gonzagas. Rinaldo
   Bonacolsi, said Passerino, lord of Mantua, was killed in 1328 in a
   conspiracy organized by Cangrande della Scala and Luigi Corradi from
   Gonzaga. They latter becomes the lord of Mantua and Gonzaga will start
   the presence in the city. The Gonzaga have preserved the Passerino mummy
   in his palace, as a kind of good luck charm. The choice of Passerino as
   a guide allows you to tell the Palace by those who lived in life and as
   a ``ghost{''}.
   It allows to tell Gonzaga not aseptically, but rather to provide those
   details and anecdotes that make the story livelier. This choice also
   allows, even at a compositional level, greater freedom being able to
   move, like a shadow, over and into the palace. This form of
   communication, divided into plastic, images and video, and narrative,
   however, requires a historical base and very solid document. The story
   of Passerino and lived experience by the public is not a simple moment
   of leisure, but represents a true educational event. The
   multi-disciplinarity of the project is precisely recognized in the
   design attitude of each individual that contributed to the installation
   definition. This research project has been translated into reality
   through the realization of a permanent installation at Palazzo Ducale,
   which opened in May 2016},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential
   integration of deep learning (DL) and digital twins (DT), referred to as
   (DDT), to facilitate Construction 4.0 through an exploratory analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach A mixed approach involving qualitative and
   quantitative analysis was applied to collect data from global industry
   experts via interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey, with an
   emphasis on the practicality and interoperability of DDT with
   decision-support capabilities for process optimization. Findings Based
   on the analysis of results, a conceptual model of the framework has been
   developed. The research findings validate that DL integrated DT model
   facilitating Construction 4.0 will incorporate cognitive abilities to
   detect complex and unpredictable actions and reasoning about dynamic
   process optimization strategies to support decision-making. Practical
   implications The DL integrated DT model will establish an interoperable
   functionality and develop typologies of models described for autonomous
   real-time interpretation and decision-making support of complex building
   systems development based on cognitive capabilities of DT.
   Originality/value The research explores how the technologies work
   collaboratively to integrate data from different environments in
   real-time through the interplay of the optimization and simulation
   during planning and construction. The framework model is a step for the
   next level of DT involving process automation and control towards
   Construction 4.0 to be implemented for different phases of the project
   lifecycle (design-planning-construction).},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Coagulation monitoring capabilities during transport are
   limited. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole-blood clotting test
   measuring clot formation, stabilization, and fibrinolysis and is
   traditionally performed in a laboratory. We evaluated a new
   point-of-care TEG analyzer, TEG 6s (Haemonetics, Braintree, MA), in a
   large animal model of combat-relevant trauma managed with extracorporeal
   life support during ground and high-altitude aeromedical evacuation. The
   objective was to compare TEG 6s used during transport versus the
   predicate device, TEG 5000, used in the laboratory. We hypothesized that
   TEG 6s would be comparable with TEG 5000 during dynamically changing
   transport conditions.
   METHODS Thromboelastography parameters (R, K, angle, MA, LY30) derived
   by TEG 6s and TEG 5000 were compared during transport of 8 swine. TEG 6s
   was transported with animals during ground transport and flight. TEG
   5000 was stationary in an adjacent building. TEG 6s activated clotting
   time (ACT) was compared with a Hemochron Junior ACT analyzer (Accriva
   Diagnostics, San Diego, CA). Statistics were performed using SAS 9.4
   with Deming regressions, Spearman correlations, and average differences
   compared.
   RESULTS Correlation between devices was stronger at sea-level (R, r =
   0.7413; K, r = 0.7115; angle, r = 0.7192; MA, r = 0.8386; LY30, r =
   0.9099) than during high-altitude transport (R, r = 0.4787; K, r =
   0.4007; angle, r = 0.3706; MA, r = 0.6573; LY30, r = 0.8481). Method
   agreement was comparable during stationary operation (R, r = 0.7978; K,
   r = 0.7974; angle, r = 0.7574; MA, r = 0.7841; LY30, r = 0.9140) versus
   ground transport (R, r = 0.7927; K, r = 0.6246; angle, r = 0.6967; MA, r
   = 0.9163; LY30, r = 0.8603). TEG 6s ACT trended higher than Hemochron
   ACT when subjects were heparinized (average difference, 1,442 1,703
   seconds) without a methodological difference by Deming regression.
   CONCLUSION Mobile TEG 6s during ground and altitude transport is
   feasible and provides unprecedented information to guide coagulation
   management. Future studies should assess the precision and accuracy of
   TEG 6s during transport of critically ill.},

Abstract = {NODES ``New tOols for Design and OpEration of Urban Transport
   InterchangeS{''} is a collaborative project co-funded by the Seventh
   Framework Programme focused on building and testing a Toolbox to support
   European cities in the design and operation of new or upgraded urban
   transport interchanges. NODES thereby provides greater support, services
   and satisfaction to travellers and users, to interchange operators as
   well as those societal and economic actors depending on the efficiency
   of the interchange. NODES provides a helping hand for European cities
   striving for inclusive, multimodal and sustainable urban transport.
   NODES is able to supply solutions and methods for Local Authorities,
   Public Transport operators as well as interchange promoters to better
   and more effectively plan, design and manage multimodal transport
   interchanges in European cities and beyond. NODES uses an integrated
   approach balancing and integrating land use and transport planning,
   interchange design, intermodality and Information Communication
   Technologies (ICT), interchange management and business models, energy
   and environment issues.
   The developed Toolbox is a catalogue of integrated planning, design and
   management tools for new or upgraded efficient urban interchange
   enabling every interchange promoter to create a more efficient,
   effective and inclusive urban transport system, bringing together all
   elements of a clean, energy-efficient, safe and intelligent transport.
   The Toolbox consists in a set of tools including technical,
   organizational, legislative, financial, energy and environment tools.
   NODES successfully developed and tested tools and integrated
   methodologies based on the most innovative technique, methods, models,
   software and regulations aimed at boosting performance of urban
   transport interchange in the different lifecycle stages such as newly
   build, refurbishment, governance and management changes, etc.
   NODES has assessed the effects of the Toolbox in the areas of land use
   planning, transport, society, economy, energy and environment. Nine
   different European cities have successfully tested the tools and
   integrated methodologies included in the Toolbox covering different
   situations, transport patterns and local peculiarities. These cities
   are: Toulouse (France), Reading (UK), Budapest (Hungary), Rotterdam
   (Netherlands), Rouen (France), Rome (Italy), Thessaloniki (Greece),
   Osnabruck (Germany), Birmingham (UK). Despite of significant differences
   among the above cities and relevant interchanges involved in the
   demonstrations activities (e.g. small city interchange, central
   interchange in large city, etc.), all the involved sites achieved
   tangible results and benefits from the Toolbox's implementation,
   enabling to transfer results in other cities beyond the project.
   The main benefits can be measured in terms of increasing multimodal
   integration and integrated information provision, reducing time of
   transfer among different modes, enhancing liveability and experience
   from travellers' prospective, safety and security, enhancing energy
   efficiency, etc. The achieved results are the basis for a future further
   exploitation of the Toolbox towards a more technological and
   modelling-oriented solution based on multi-criteria, object oriented and
   agent-based approaches, enabling to deliver most effective and efficient
   combination of integrated tools and techniques, through an incremental
   and modular approach. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The development of the skills of employees of the Latvian Public
   Administration is becoming increasingly attentive. In order to improve
   the quality of work, develop creative thinking, knowledge, adapt to the
   developments and demands of the 21 st century, there is a regular need
   to improve personal and professional competences. Consequently, it is
   important to understand whether employees are in line with a specialised
   profession, how to develop and maintain the competences of employees,
   which, as a result of today's rapid development of technology, have
   played an imporrole in the process of day-to-day work. The importance of
   education is becoming increasingly focused, as life has become more
   dynamic and the expectations and demands of the employer have become
   greater, so employees must try to adapt to learning. When starting a new
   job, each person discovers gaps in both his or her skills and knowledge,
   but these gaps need to be improved in order to successfully fulfil their
   job responsibilities. Learning difficulties arise for the whole of
   society, because we now live in an information environment that needs to
   be adapted to all people. The effects of the development of information
   technology can be observed for people of different ages, and therefore
   the attitudes to change and training are different because of their
   values, resulting in decisions and changes. Therefore, the interests,
   objectives and values of employees, which lead to attitudes towards
   capacity building, play an important role in improving competence. If
   the values of institutions and employees match, the quality of work is
   improved, employee turnover is reduced and there is a desire for
   continuous development.
   The aim of the study is to develop a model for the interaction of
   individual values in the development of competence and to assess the
   impact of the values of employees on development.
   The above justify the choice and the spotlight of the subject of the
   study.
   The object of the study shall be employees of the Public Administration.
   Subject-matter of the study: the impact of the values employed by the
   institution in the development of competence. The methods used by the
   study are the analysis of scientific documents and the qualitative
   method.},

Title = {Effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields on flora and fauna, Part
   2 impacts: how species interact with natural and man-made EMF},
Journal = {REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Ambient levels of nonionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF) have risen
   sharply in the last five decades to become a ubiquitous, continuous,
   biologically active environmental pollutant, even in rural and remote
   areas. Many species of flora and fauna, because of unique physiologies
   and habitats, are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that surpass human
   reactivity. This can lead to complex endogenous reactions that are
   highly variable, largely unseen, and a possible contributing factor in
   species extinctions, sometimes localized. Non-human magnetoreception
   mechanisms are explored. Numerous studies across all frequencies and
   taxa indicate that current low-level anthropogenic EMF can have myriad
   adverse and synergistic effects, including on orientation and migration,
   food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial
   maintenance and defense, and on vitality, longevity and survivorship
   itself. Effects have been observed in mammals such as bats, cervids,
   cetaceans, and pinnipeds among others, and on birds, insects,
   amphibians, reptiles, microbes and many species of flora. Cyto- and
   geno-toxic effects have long been observed in laboratory research on
   animal models that can be extrapolated to wildlife. Unusual multi-system
   mechanisms can come into play with non-human species - including in
   aquatic environments - that rely on the Earth's natural geomagnetic
   fields for critical life-sustaining information. Part 2 of this 3-part
   series includes four online supplement tables of effects seen in animals
   from both ELF and RFR at vanishingly low intensities. Taken as a whole,
   this indicates enough information to raise concerns about ambient
   exposures to nonionizing radiation at ecosystem levels. Wildlife loss is
   often unseen and undocumented until tipping points are reached. It is
   time to recognize ambient EMF as a novel form of pollution and develop
   rules at regulatory agencies that designate air as `habitat' so EMF can
   be regulated like other pollutants. Long-term chronic low-level EMF
   exposure standards, which do not now exist, should be set accordingly
   for wildlife, and environmental laws should be strictly enforced - a
   subject explored in Part 3.},

Abstract = {For Romania, as for many European countries, the most damaging
   geophysical events are floods, which cause significant damage every year
   over large areas, with the loss of human lives and economic
   consequences. Flood forecasting, warning and emergency response play
   important roles ill reducing flood risk during the event. Options for
   flood risk management range from structural measures, such as raising
   dikes or channel enlargement, to non-structural measures to reduce
   exposure and vulnerability. The April 2000 floods in the western part of
   Romania (Crisuri River Basin) represented the starting point in creating
   a dedicated system for flood management using Earth Observation (EO)
   data. Starting from April 2005 this satellite-based surveillance system,
   connected to a dedicated GIS database, was extended to cover the whole
   Romanian territory. In order to obtain high-level thematic products, the
   data extracted from EO images were integrated with other spatial
   ancillary data (topographical, pedological, meteorological) and
   hydrological/hydraulic model outputs. A series of specific image
   processing operations were performed, using the ERDAS Imagine software:
   geometric correction and geo-referencing, image improvement, statistic
   analyses, etc. The optical and microwave satellite data supplied by the
   new European and American orbital platforms like the EOS-AM ``Terra{''}
   and EOS-PM ``Aqua{''}, DMSP, Quikscat, SPOT, ERS, RADARSAT, Landsat7
   have been used to identify and highlight flooded areas.
   This approach is used in different phases of establishing the sensitive
   areas such as: the database management; the calculation of risk indices
   from morpho-hydrographical, meteorological and hydrological data;
   interfacing with the models in order to improve their compatibility with
   input data; recovery of results and the possibility of working out
   scenarios; presentation of results as synthesis maps easy to access and
   interpret, adequate to also be combined with other information layouts
   resulted from the GIS database. The products which are useful for flood
   risk analysis include: accurately updated maps of land cover/land-use,
   comprehensive thematic maps at various spatial scales with the extent of
   the flooded areas and the affected zones, maps of hazard-prone areas.
   The satellite-based products contributed to a preventive consideration
   of extreme flood events by developing plans for flood mitigation,
   building infrastructure in flood-prone areas and by optimizing the
   distribution of spatial flood-related information to local and river
   authorities.},

Title = {TOWARDS NEXT GENERATION CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND DIGITAL TWINS FOR
   CONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {505-525},
Abstract = {The construction industry continues to seek innovative ways to safely,
   timely and cost-effectively deliver construction projects. Several
   efforts have been made to automate construction processes but marginial
   success has been achieved in effectively reducing the long standing
   risks suffered by the industry. While industry 4.0 promises to improve
   project efficiency, reduce waste and improve productivity, the
   transition to this will depend on the successful adoption of many
   emerging technologies such as virtual design modeling technologies,
   sensing technologies, data analysis, storage and communication
   technologies, human-computer interaction technologies, and robotics. To
   accelerate innovation, digital twins and cyber physical systems will be
   a necessity to advance automation and real-time control with these
   technologies. While digital twin represents a digital replica of the
   asplanned and as-built facility, cyber physical systems involve
   integration of physical systems with their digital replica through
   sensors and actuators. Despite evidence of the efficacy of
   cyber-physical systems and digital twins for reducing non fatal
   injuries, enhancing safety management, improving progress monitoring and
   enhancing performance monitoring and control of facilities, their
   adoption in the construction industry is still in its infancy. This
   paper sheds light on the opportunities offered by cyber-physical systems
   and digital twins in other industry sectors and advocates for their
   increased deployment in the construction industry. This paper describes
   cyber-physical integration of emerging technologies with the physical
   construction or constructed facility as the next generation digital twin
   and cyber-physical systems. Potential scenarios of next generation cyber
   physical system and digital twin for improving workforce productivity,
   health, and safety, lifecycle management of building systems, and
   workforce competency are presented.},

Abstract = {Introduction. The beginning of the third millennium is marked with the
   powerful implementation of IT technologies in all spheres of the modern
   society life, in particular, for the transformation of the spatial
   or-ganization of the city as a whole. Problem Statement. The functional
   and socio-planning organization of the territory of Ukrainian cities, as
   formed during the industrialization period of the 1930s and the
   restoration of the national economy period of the 1940s and 1950s, has
   been increasingly contradicting the general world trends in the
   formation of a modern comfortable living environment and needs to be
   reformed. Purpose. The purpose of this research is to identify trends in
   the formation of the urban space functional planning organization during
   the post-industrial period of society development and directions for the
   transformation of the territory and buildings from the existing
   condition into an innovation-based city. Materials and Methods.
   Systematization of results of the analysis of scholarly research
   pub-lications, legal framework, and information sources in the field of
   urban design during the post-industrial period of society development;
   graphoanalytic method of design and planning documen-tation analysis;
   structural and logical modeling. Results. The evolutionary stages of the
   transformation of the ideal city paradigm from Re-naissance cities to
   modern smart and innovation-based cities have been characterized. The
   con-ceptual differences in the formation of the spatial organization of
   the smart and the innovation-based city have been identified; the featu
   res of horizontal and vertical urban space polyfunctionali-zation have
   been formulated. The principles and recommendations for the possible
   transformation of the Ukrainian cities territory have been developed.
   Conclusions. The key principles for the formation of the human
   comfortable and safe living environment evol ve in strict accordance
   with the engineering, technological, and social basis of the society
   development. The current stage is characterized by the active
   implementation of the cutting-edge IT technologies in all spheres of
   life, causing the need to transform the urban space from the
   monofunctional use of territories to the horizontal and vertical
   polyfunctionalization. Such trends shall be enshrined in the legislative
   and regulatory framework of urban planning for the further
   im-plementation into the reconstruction practice of Ukrainian cities.},

Abstract = {During last decades, the international community has become aware of the
   need to adapt to the effects of climate change, as the sensitivity of
   natural and human systems gained relevance. Europe is one of the most
   urbanized regions, accounting for a 73\% of people living in urban
   areas. This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has
   concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are
   considered as one of the most vulnerable areas.
   European cities are characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage,
   which is commonly located in what is defined as the historic city. In
   order to protect urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis
   should be given to the integration of conservation management and urban
   planning strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable
   development.
   Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy
   and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to
   address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a
   sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing
   building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and
   social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a
   new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should
   be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole
   city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE
   project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate
   change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context.
   Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at
   urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the
   context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the
   overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive
   measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve
   resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with
   the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order
   to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of
   object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they
   are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in
   clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its
   stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability
   vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage
   and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the
   overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk
   scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures.
   Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an
   evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more
   educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit
   eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of
   climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and
   public authorities.},

Abstract = {The Knowledge Society made the concept of lifelong learning a continuous
   objective, necessity and challenge driving changes in the way we learn.
   Today lifelong learning became an essential ``way of life{''} for many
   individuals permanently engaged in personal self-development by seeking
   new ways of extending their knowledge and skills. For them lifelong
   learning is a tool for better and faster professional development thus
   building a sustainable career.
   In itself, lifelong learning sets new requirements to learning - to be
   faster, cheaper and better. But to be more efficient lifelong learning
   needs new concepts, approaches, integrated solutions and flexible tools
   that can be easily adapted to various informal training needs and
   models.
   Obviously today there is a critical need of significantly improved
   concepts and methodologies to guide a new instructional design and
   development of more efficient e-learning/e-training processes.
   The paper describes a new instructional design and its implementation
   into lifelong learning and vocational education and training. Course
   development and learning process management methodology based on Lean
   principles makes e-learning more efficient by:
   -shifting from the ``passive{''} book paradigm to a new ``active{''}
   e-learning content structure and information workflow conveying the
   knowledge,
   -integrating measurement and control elements into the digital content
   workflow and thus improve the efficiency of the whole e-learning process
   and its management,
   -designing knowledge maps by dynamically hyper linking ``active{''}
   knowledge and learning objects on them and charting shortest learning
   paths.
   -The major advantage of the proposed innovative methodology is that the
   well performed self-directed autonomous learners get the exact required
   outcomes (=knowledge) with no waste of time (=improved efficiency).
   The presented methodology is well suited to all learning areas, but it
   has clear advantages in learning applications with precisely predefined
   learning goals (the exact knowledge and skills to be acquired at the end
   of the course). From this point of view, the paper presents the way of
   integration of this methodology into learning/training process oriented
   on the improving knowledge in the area of renewable energies.},

Title = {Brain tumour segmentation with incomplete imaging data},
Journal = {BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Brain tumour segmentation models with incomplete sets of MRI
   sequences-common in clinical practice-still delineate lesions well and
   even identify enhancing tumour without post-contrast imaging. The
   observed marginal benefits of additional MR sequences-especially
   contrast-enhanced-suggest that the costs and risks of imaging ordinarily
   sufficient to permit high-definition quantitative analysis may be
   reducible.
   Progress in neuro-oncology is increasingly recognized to be obstructed
   by the marked heterogeneity-genetic, pathological, and clinical-of brain
   tumours. If the treatment susceptibilities and outcomes of individual
   patients differ widely, determined by the interactions of many
   multimodal characteristics, then large-scale, fully-inclusive, richly
   phenotyped data-including imaging-will be needed to predict them at the
   individual level. Such data can realistically be acquired only in the
   routine clinical stream, where its quality is inevitably degraded by the
   constraints of real-world clinical care. Although contemporary machine
   learning could theoretically provide a solution to this task, especially
   in the domain of imaging, its ability to cope with realistic,
   incomplete, low-quality data is yet to be determined. In the largest and
   most comprehensive study of its kind, applying state-of-the-art brain
   tumour segmentation models to large scale, multi-site MRI data of 1251
   individuals, here we quantify the comparative fidelity of automated
   segmentation models drawn from MR data replicating the various levels of
   completeness observed in real life. We demonstrate that models trained
   on incomplete data can segment lesions very well, often equivalently to
   those trained on the full completement of images, exhibiting Dice
   coefficients of 0.907 (single sequence) to 0.945 (complete set) for
   whole tumours and 0.701 (single sequence) to 0.891 (complete set) for
   component tissue types. This finding opens the door both to the
   application of segmentation models to large-scale historical data, for
   the purpose of building treatment and outcome predictive models, and
   their application to real-world clinical care. We further ascertain that
   segmentation models can accurately detect enhancing tumour in the
   absence of contrast-enhancing imaging, quantifying the burden of
   enhancing tumour with an R-2 > 0.97, varying negligibly with lesion
   morphology. Such models can quantify enhancing tumour without the
   administration of intravenous contrast, inviting a revision of the
   notion of tumour enhancement if the same information can be extracted
   without contrast-enhanced imaging. Our analysis includes validation on a
   heterogeneous, real-world 50 patient sample of brain tumour imaging
   acquired over the last 15 years at our tertiary centre, demonstrating
   maintained accuracy even on non-isotropic MRI acquisitions, or even on
   complex post-operative imaging with tumour recurrence. This work
   substantially extends the translational opportunity for quantitative
   analysis to clinical situations where the full complement of sequences
   is not available and potentially enables the characterization of
   contrast-enhanced regions where contrast administration is infeasible or
   undesirable.},

Title = {INTELLECTUALIZATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF TRADE ENTERPRISES ACTIVITIES},
Journal = {ACADEMY REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-59},
Abstract = {One of the directions of modern development of enterprises and
   organizations is the intellectualization of their activity as a
   condition of the efficiency of its functioning. Conducted content
   analysis on the definition of concepts and characteristics of
   ``management{''} and ``enterprise management{''} becomes the basis for
   the conclusion about the combination of the process of enterprise
   management with its main purpose - the development of
   intellectualization of its activities. According to the categorical
   analysis of the concept of ``management system{''} of the enterprise and
   certain key aspects of the investigated category, it is ascertained that
   the management of the system is, in particular, a process of
   ``adjustment{''} of all its elements in such a way that the ``output{''}
   receives the smallest deviations in comparison with the planned and
   actually obtained results. It is established that the fundamental
   difference between the management of intellectualization of activity as
   a resource lies in the fact that one of the results of the activity of
   the system, along with the traditional result as a product in the broad
   sense, is to improve the quality characteristics of employees. The basic
   axiom is taken: the initial characteristics of intellectual improvement
   of employees are education and morality, which determine the intrinsic
   values of individuals, which further shape the moral norms of economic
   behavior in various areas of social life. The article is devoted to
   substantiation of theoretical and methodological and practical
   recommendations for improving the intellectual property management
   system of trade enterprises. The initial thesis-axioms for
   substantiating the methodological foundations of building a system of
   management of intellectualization of trade enterprises became its
   provision of a triad of directions: management of intellectualization of
   activity as a resource, management of intellectualization of activity as
   a process, and management of the development of intellectual activity of
   personnel. The peculiarities of intellectualization of activity of
   trading enterprises are established: obtaining two independent results
   of work: information (newly created or transformed - produced) and human
   development; the probability of a high ``cost{''} error; temporal
   unlimitedness of the process as a whole and unpredictably discrete and
   unpredictably continuous in structure. A functional model of a real
   system of intellectual property management of trading enterprises has
   been developed. It is substantiated that the management of the
   intellectualization of trade enterprises is a system of harmonization of
   different interests within the enterprise due to the development of
   intellectual activity of the personnel, increasing the efficiency of the
   use of intellectual resources and intellectual labor processes.},

Title = {BASIC TRAITS OF CLINICAL HUMAN STRUCTURAL PSYCHOTHERAPY},
Journal = {DYNAMISCHE PSYCHIATRIE},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {In the introduction to the present paper the authors describe the
   development of the Berlin School of Dynamic Psychiatry, also defined as
   Human Structurology, in the last 25 years following Ammon's classical
   psychiatric and psychoanalytic training in Germany and the USA. This
   development was prompted by the insufficiency of traditional therapeutic
   thinking and practice, when confronted with severe borderline,
   psychotic, psychosomatic and obsessive-compulsive illness.
   The treatment of such patients calls for a deep change of approach,
   whose various facets can be summed up as a change of paradigm. It
   involves a new approach to science, to man and to illness, implicitly
   also to oneself and to society; further, a new conception of health and
   disease, of body, mind and spirit. Science is subordinated, in this
   conception, to the human being in all his dimensions, rendering dynamic
   psychiatry a true science of man.
   In its understanding of severe psychiatric disorders, as for example the
   psychoses, dynamic psychiatry follows a path opposed to the dogmatic
   belief defining them as unintelligible and untreatable. In this context,
   the therapeutic significance of the new paradigm is a consequence of
   Ammon's therapeutic optimism. >>Only he can heal, who believes in
   healing..<< The fundamental principle of human structural science is its
   own image of man. Man is, in this concept, a multidimensional being with
   healthy as well as pathological aspects, whereas the healthy elements
   are relevant for therapeutic work. Man is a being living in groups,
   whose dynamics condition the development of his personality. At the same
   time, he is, in Ammon's words, >>an individual being striving for
   identity, self realization and a sense of his existence.<< Accordingly,
   illness is defined as a loss of the homeostasis of body, mind and
   spirit, a restriction of multidimensionality and a development arrest.
   In the concept of dynamic psychiatry, identity is a group-related
   process dependent on social energy and involving continuous development
   during the whole life. Social energy replaces the Freudian libido
   concept. It is the energy inherent in human contacts and relationships.
   Social energetic exchange plays the main role in building up and
   structuring personality. Thus, personality structure can be visualized
   as manifested social energy.
   The human structural model described by the authors is based on their
   conception of identity and the image of man. Human structure contains
   the areas of primary (meaning organic), central (meaning mainly
   unconscious) and secondary human functions (meaning functions of
   behaviour). These three areas are synergistically and dynamically
   interconnected and related to surrounding groups, whose internalized
   dynamics in early childhood make up the major part of the unconscious.
   The spectrum of interaction of single human functions ranges from
   regulated and integrated to poorly regulated and desintegrated
   functions. According to Ammon's spectral theory, not only the three
   human structural areas, but also their constructive, destructive and
   deficient aspects are understood as lying on a continuum.
   A large part of the paper is consecrated to the conceptualization of
   illness within the framework of Human Structurology. Illness is
   structurally understood as a temporary loss of homeostasis and
   desintegration of personality functions, but at the same time it makes
   demands on the whole personality which cannot cope with its deficiently
   developed parts (>>holes in the Ego<<, in Ammon's words). Consequently,
   symptoms have the meaning of filling such deficits, in order to avoid a
   breakdown of the whole personality. Thus, the aim of treatment consists
   not in symptom alleviation, but rather in enabling the patient to
   develop his human structure by transforming destructive and deficient
   into constructive aspects. This therapeutic process must take place
   primarily in the nonconscious core of the personality. Clinical
   experience shows that symptom reduction occurs as a consequence of
   structural development. The ultimate goal of treatment is directed
   toward identity development, improving the contact ability of the
   patient. >>Identity therapy must reach man's inner core.<< This is
   achieved by constructive social energetic exchange processes within the
   groups, and this fact entails a definite therapeutic conception. Dynamic
   psychiatric therapy offers the patient, with his desintegrated
   personality, the possibility of taking up contact to his own
   non-conscious needs, to other people and to his surroundings.
   In the dynamic psychiatric hospital Menterschwaige, this therapeutic
   conception is realized by the multidimensional verbal and non-verbal
   methods integrated into a milieu therapeutic and social energetic field
   involving the whole hospital. The therapeutic program is individually
   planned for each patient and involves individual and group therapy,
   milieu therapeutic work on various projects, as well as dance therapy,
   music therapy, theatre and art therapy, riding and sport therapy. The
   single therapy forms are integrated on the level of control groups of
   the therapeutic team and of the plenary group of the whole hospital.
   In a short historical review, the authors show that psychotherapeutic
   treatment of severe ego disturbances, like the psychoses, cannot be
   achieved by individual therapy alone. Rather, it makes basic therapy in
   groups necessary, using the tod of group dynamics. In the therapeutic of
   the hospital, each patient has several therapists and is part of several
   groups. . The authors describe in detail the analytical group therapy
   and the milieu groups in their theoretical and practical aspects as a
   temporary therapeutic life community. The specific caracteristics of the
   non-verbal therapy forms are also described by the authors, for instance
   the enacting of the patient's own pathology in the theatre therapy, the
   importance of body language in dance therapy and the group dynamic
   polyphonic work in music therapy. However, non-verbal therapy is always
   connected with, and must lead towards, verbal expression of the patient;
   the integrating function of verbalisation is thereby emphasized.
   Fundamental for the whole therapy is the work with the healthy parts of
   the personality, while working through deficient and destructive human
   functions. Dynamic psychiatric treatment is centered around working
   through of the destructive aggression. Further therapeutic instruments
   are the systematic use of the mirror function within the groups and the
   social work with the family of the patient during the whole time of
   therapy. Exemplarily, the problem of paranoic patients is discussed,
   stressing the importance of the resistance triangle of aggression,
   paranoia and pathological narcissism, as described by Ammon in earlier
   works. Above all, therapy is understood as a process involving the whole
   person, based on the implicit image of man in his inherent capacity of
   further development. In this context, the authors emphasize that the
   therapist must be experienced by the patient in his true human wholeness
   as a partner in his relationship to the patient.
   The following chapter of the paper deals with the human structural
   diagnosing process, also based on holistic understanding. It involves
   not only psychiatric, but also psychogenetic, group dynamic and human
   strucutral assessment of the personality, completed by a number of
   standardized psychological tests, among which Ammon's Ego Structure Test
   (ISTA) is described in detail. Further diagnostic means include the
   Autokinetic Light Test (AKL), as well as sociometric and
   group-diagnostical investigations and electroencephalographic sleep
   registrations. The complexity of diagnostic results is integrated in the
   case conferences which allow a global understanding of the specific
   personality structure of the patient, his development and the planning
   of adequate therapy. Diagnostic work runs parallel to the therapeutic
   process and implies a continuous feedback of information, serving as an
   indicator of the treatment efficiency.
   The authors present the human structural model of personality
   assessment, as a hypothetical construction allowing an insight in the
   non conscious human structure by means of behavioural and experiencial
   secondary functions. This theoretical model constitutes the basis of
   efficiency investigations in the dynamic psychiatric hospital. The
   authors describe a shortcut of the results obtained in the course of
   efficiency investigations. These show a significant increase of healthy
   personality functions, expressed on the behavioral level, an increase in
   the capacity of tying relationships, in working and learning ability,and
   an improved contact to oneself and the environment. At the same time a
   decrease of deficient and destructive personality functions becomes
   evident. The paramount therapeutic importance of the work on destructive
   aggression is again emphasized.
   An extension of the efficiency research is provided by the catamnestic
   investigations of the Munich Catamnestic Project, whose first results
   are presented by the authors. The results confirm the importance of
   outpatient treatment after leaving the hospital.},

Abstract = {A few treatment options exist for patients experiencing xerostomia due
   to hyposalivation that occurs as a result of disease or injury to the
   gland. An opportunity for a permanent solution lies in the field of
   salivary gland replacement through tissue engineering. Recent success
   emboldens in the vision of producing a tissue-engineered salivary gland
   composed of differentiated salivary epithelial cells that are able to
   differentiate to form functional units that produce and deliver saliva
   to the oral cavity. This vision is augmented by advances in
   understanding cellular mechanisms that guide branching morphogenesis and
   salivary epithelial cell polarization in both acinar and ductal
   structures. Growth factors and other guidance cues introduced into
   engineered constructs help to develop a more complex glandular structure
   that seeks to mimic native salivary gland tissue. This review describes
   the separate epithelial phenotypes that make up the gland, and it
   describes their relationship with the other cell types such as nerve and
   vasculature that surround them. The review is organized around the links
   between the native components that form and contribute to various
   aspects of salivary gland development, structure, and function and how
   this information can drive the design of functional tissue-engineered
   constructs. In addition, we discuss the attributes of various
   biomaterials commonly used to drive function and form in engineered
   constructs. The review also contains a current description of the
   state-of-the-art of the field, including successes and challenges in
   creating materials for preclinical testing in animal models. The ability
   to integrate biomolecular cues in combination with a range of materials
   opens the door to the design of increasingly complex salivary gland
   structures that, once accomplished, can lead to breakthroughs in other
   fields of tissue engineering of epithelial-based exocrine glands or oral
   tissues. Impact statement Millions of people worldwide suffer from
   xerostomia/dry mouth owing to hyposalivation from disease, injury, or
   aging. Loss of saliva impairs eating, swallowing and leads to oral
   disease. Tissue engineering of salivary glands using primary adult
   stem/progenitor cell populations encapsulated in customized hydrogels
   offers a permanent solution. New materials are being developed to
   provide cues to encourage salivary cells to organize into functional
   structures that resemble acini connected to functional, branched ductal
   networks. Once formed, it is envisioned that these salivary neotissues
   can be implanted to restore salivation and improve the quality of life
   for xerostomic patients.},

Abstract = {Is it possible to investigate new scenarios for urban sustainability,
   using a service research approach to explore sustainable services based
   on participation, delocalisation, knowledge sharing and energy
   efficiency?
   CityLab, a course in Service Design held at the Design Faculty of
   Politecnico di Milano, has looked at sustainable urban changes in
   correlation to the city as a possible context of innovation.
   In this scenario it is possible to identify an important evolution: the
   transition from a model of innovation based on the relationship between
   people and products to one based on services and social relationships
   (related to the emerging needs of groups, networks and/or communities of
   citizens, workers, users, clients.). In particular, CityLab has focused
   on crucial opportunities for service design to intervene, which
   significantly affect the urban and metropolitan quality of life
   (welfare, energy, communication, food, work).
   Investigating such a complex context as the city requires the
   development of a specific teaching approach that considers the relevance
   of three factors:
   - the nature and typology of the teaching activities related to service
   design are changing: research activities are becoming as important as
   practice-based ones;
   - the impact of internet and communication technologies are redefining
   the method and the approach of teaching and research activities in the
   field of design;
   - the inclination to social networking and crowd-sourcing of the design
   students falls back on how they approach teaching activities.
   The teaching model here proposed is based on a collaborative approach
   aimed at creating a shared knowledge repository: the tool is an on-line
   platform dedicated to building a community of researchers/designers (the
   whole class) capable of envisioning service design scenarios.
   The activity has followed specific steps:
   1. Problem setting: creation of a set of focused mind maps describing
   the interesting theoretical fields and their connections;
   2. What if scenario: what would the services for the city look like if.
   3. Qualitative research: blue sky research and best practice analysis.
   CityLab community (students supported by professors) has shared all the
   information and results through a blog. The shared repository has
   enabled:
   - the creation of a rhizomatic map to distinguish areas for potential
   innovation, and to allow exchange of knowledge among professors and
   students;
   - a collective and continuous learning process on design topics and
   service design tools;
   - the creation of a place for discussion and research on service and
   sustainable design topics (research Lab).
   The adopted approach is innovative for its idea of collective and
   continuous learning, which has lead the class to work as a real research
   lab (or better, as a peer network), beyond the physical limits of the
   class itself (time and space) and with the development of a think tank
   based on the blog, of which all the students have been authors and
   contributors.},

Abstract = {In the age of information the concept of evaluation and efficiency come
   up quickly. The quality of our life highly depends on the quality of our
   thinking. Poor thinking proves to be expensive not only in money as
   mainly in the quality of life. Within such a context, the majority of
   the researchers who have treated critical thinking have focused to its
   skills as well as to the weaknesses that appear for its development.
   What is essential for the development of critical thinking are those
   skills related to the problem solving. In order that a person thinks
   critically, he must first learn general skills in problem solving and to
   be able to use the knowledge on a new basis. The educational method
   ``Problem-Based Learning{''} (PBL) has been presented as a promising
   strategy for the enchanting of critical thinking of students.
   In a parallel framework, many researches claimed that critical thinking
   skills can be better developed through the application of Web 2.0 tools.
   A division of Web 2.0 tools are the Wiki tools. The Wikis, when
   incorporated in the educational process, can support the collaborative
   activities that enchant critical thinking and problem solving. In any
   case, it is necessary to be incorporated into modern teaching strategies
   and techniques which can effectively maximize the ability of students to
   learn using mainly their critical thinking.
   In the present study, a double teaching application of a Web 2.0 tool
   has been promoted and specifically the Wiki tool PbWorks. At first level
   the specific tool supported the traditional teaching ``Discussion
   Model{''}. At a second level this Wiki tool was combined with the
   teaching method PBL. The aim in both cases was, through the above
   applications, to count and evaluate the development of critical thinking
   skills in primary education.
   Following the above guidelines, two educational scenarios were designed,
   implemented and evaluated, in which the students with the help of the
   Wiki tool PbWorks tried to give solutions to the problem of the
   ``environmental pollution{''}. The design and the implementation of the
   above procedure referred and applied to fifty six (56) students of sixth
   and fourth grade in primary school for the subject of English in
   2011-2012 and 2012-2013 respectively. The whole procedure lasted a
   period of six (6) weeks. The wiki tool PbWorks seems to be able to
   support effectively the PBL method as it incorporates the following
   characteristics: a) it is focused on the problem, b) it is student
   centered, c) the environment is active and not passive, d) the students
   control personally their understanding on the specific subject, e) the
   teacher plays the role of facilitator, f) in PbWorks pairs of students
   working together are formed.
   The study has been based in evaluation rubrics and resulted that in the
   second teaching scenario in which the teaching method PBL and the
   collaborative writing were used, those critical thinking skills related
   to the problem solving were developed in a higher degree. More
   specifically there developed the recognition of assumption, the
   inference, the evaluation of arguments as well as the interpretation of
   ideas. This significant difference was observed in both classes of
   primary education in which the study was carried out.},

Abstract = {The exchange of teaching and research in the field of knowledge
   Construction Economy, Site Management and Construction Management (BBB)
   has gained a remarkable development at the universities in Germany,
   Austria and Switzerland (D A CH) in the past 30 years. The establishment
   of the BBB Professors circle in October 1986 at the University of
   Wuppertal, a knowledge community through the annual meetings in
   uninterrupted sequence, this year in September for the 30th time at the
   RWTH Aachen, led to intensify acquaintance among colleagues, comparing
   and creating transparency. The focus is on new developments and the
   awareness of priorities at the individual university locations.
   Significant auxiliary position offered the BBB Professors circle after
   the reunification of Germany both the content and composition of the BBB
   professorships at the university locations in the new federal states.
   Since 1990, the BBB academic staff organizes annual BBB Assistants
   meetings for the scientific technical exchange and the discussion of
   their doctoral and research projects, most recently the 26th BBB
   Assistants meeting in June 2015 at the University of Stuttgart. During
   BBB Professors meeting 2005 in Kassel, the university teachers'
   Memorandum by F. Berner / H. Hahr, university of Stuttgart, was adopted
   by the BBB professors: Construction Management and Economics University
   Teaching and Research{''} {[}1]. The BBB Memorandum 2015: Mission of
   Construction Economy, Site Management and Construction Management{''} by
   A. Tautschnig, University of Innsbruck, R. Osebold, RWTH Aachen, and
   H.-1. Bargstadt, Bauhaus-University Weimar, will be released after
   voting in the BBB Professors Circle in September in this Bauingenieur.
   Since 2011, the day before the BBB Professors circle the International
   BBB Congress is held every two years in conjunction with the annual
   meeting, so 2011 at the TU Dresden, 2013 at the TU Darmstadt and on
   17.09.2015 the 3rd International BBB Congress at the RWTH Aachen.
   The main areas of teaching include in accordance to the BBB memorandum
   2015 in the core area the planning and construction management, real
   estate and construction planning, the Construction Management and Site
   Management, in the supplementary area subjects such as economics, real
   estate valuation, portfolio-, property- and asset management, turnkey
   construction, refurbishment, international construction and labor law,
   and in the interdisciplinary field construction law, corporate
   governance, accounting, project studies and teamwork, foreign languages,
   negotiation and personal development.
   The main areas of the BBB research topics include in the core area the
   project and corporate level, Construction Technology and the real estate
   industry, in the supplementary field, inter alia, risk management and
   sustainable building, in the interdisciplinary field among others BIM
   and lean management.
   The Logo BBB{''}, created 1986 in Wuppertal, for Housing and
   Construction, Site Management and Construction Technology has thus
   developed to BBBplus{''} for Construction Economy, Site Management,
   Construction Management, Construction Technology, Corporate Governance,
   Construction Law and Lifecycle Management.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the quality of a speech and language
   therapy (SLT) swallow service provided to adults with intellectual
   disability (ID) by exploring the process and outcome factors; to explore
   the process of what is done to and for the patient including identifying
   dysphagia, choking and pneumonia risk, typical interventions and
   management; examine clinical outcomes; and explore the relationship of
   outcomes with risk factors, satisfaction with the service and the impact
   of the service on the number of choking incidents and admissions to
   acute hospital with swallow concerns.Design/methodology/approachThere
   were three specific work packages: (1) collecting and scrutinising
   patient data from the clinical record for adults with ID referred to the
   SLT swallow service over a six-month period. The researcher created
   aims, defined the limits to achieve the aims, designed a standardised
   data collection form, set out where data was in the clinical record,
   piloted, set limits for collection and trained reviewers; (2) gathering
   experience and satisfaction surveys from patients, caregivers and
   referrers over the six-month study period; and (3) monitoring choking
   adverse incident reports and hospital admission with swallow concerns
   for the whole ID population.FindingsChoking and hospital admission were
   the main reasons for referral, and pneumonia risk significantly
   predicted dysphagia impairment. The research highlighted common
   dysphagia risk factors, interventions and recommendations for this
   population. The SLT swallow service is a quality service that is highly
   valued by patients, their caregivers and referrers. The service achieves
   significant clinical improvements, helps identify dysphagia and provides
   management to reduce associated risks.Research
   limitations/implicationsThis study found common dysphagia risk factors,
   interventions and recommendations; it also found that the therapy
   outcome measures/Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy online
   outcome tool was a meaningful outcome measure, and that pneumonia risk
   significantly predicted dysphagia impairment, all of which could inform
   the identified dysphagia research priorities for this
   population.Practical implicationsNaming usual care in treatment and
   recommendations could help ensure a fair service and could help form
   quality indicators. People with ID, their caregivers and staff generated
   valuable ideas for improvement, and further involvement work could
   create a logic model for the service. Other future work could explore
   the use of screening tools, increase multidisciplinary team working,
   improve access to instrumental assessments, raise awareness of
   swallowing and promote important oral health and medication reviews. By
   using this information to shape quality improvement work and policies,
   one can work toward addressing high health-related inequalities and
   preventable deaths associated with dysphagia in this vulnerable
   population.Social implicationsIt may be useful to raise awareness that
   adults with ID age earlier and that one should not exclude them from
   older people's services because of an age threshold, often set higher
   than their life expectancy. This study highlighted a possible inequality
   of access issue for adults with ID who do not have direct care or day
   care staff. There is a need to increase access to awareness training so
   caregivers and general practitioners can recognise swallow difficulties
   and know how to make a referral for a swallow assessment.
   Originality/valueOverall, the evaluation of the swallow service to
   adults with ID suggests that SLT have a quality service for adults with
   ID that is highly valued and provides significant clinical improvements.
   By building on these strengths, SLT could extend the reach, influence
   and impact of their services to help those adults with ID who have
   emerging swallow difficulties or who do not access the service.},

Abstract = {The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the
   healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully
   supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare
   providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care
   ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an
   appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation
   for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing
   shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human
   solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant
   others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills
   in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and
   equality by advocating `standing with' or aiding fellow community
   members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical
   needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake,
   when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of
   justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on
   solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my
   view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly
   restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on
   solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that
   supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import
   for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks,
   personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend
   solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal
   Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to
   solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles.
   Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare
   have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its
   traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity,
   or indeed, any use of the term that posits an `other' against which
   solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that
   the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of
   some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and
   especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the
   current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in
   healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight
   a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely,
   structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against
   adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic
   action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched
   inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of
   justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a
   rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill
   suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare
   in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare
   in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it
   applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the
   obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional
   notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states
   remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity
   needs to show how it is connected to justice.
   It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly
   interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation
   between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications
   we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer
   to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the
   existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant
   analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and
   without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the
   impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an
   understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with
   the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only
   our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of
   the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address
   here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the
   needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our
   obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts,
   but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and
   articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in
   calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for
   bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched
   several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely.
   They advance the following definition: `Solidarity is an enacted
   commitment to carry ``costs{''} (financial, social, emotional, or
   otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize
   similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop
   the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within
   three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the
   administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although
   it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call
   axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this
   latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance
   morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a
   gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic
   utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity
   from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of
   the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the
   context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like
   justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of
   solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most
   highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature,
   it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on
   and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their
   approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding
   solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states.
   Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others
   within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a
   `civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection
   with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be
   entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of
   that European model in their understanding (though their conception is
   supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity).
   Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice
   helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action
   orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other
   sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing `costs'
   with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian
   tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and
   aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual
   activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term
   `costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether
   easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of
   solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the
   alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where
   solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming
   domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this
   article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity
   introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity,
   one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although
   Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and
   charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their
   argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked
   by assistance for others who are perceived as `different' from oneself,
   rather than as being `similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is
   that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect,
   inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where
   people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition
   to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in
   solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would
   be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of
   what is perceived as `similar' and what counts as `a relevant respect,'
   remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of
   similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the
   perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be
   explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that
   is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid
   circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow
   citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others
   already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of
   our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such
   as these and also explicate what counts as `similar in a relevant
   respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own
   view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the
   distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection
   that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination
   and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense
   to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx
   sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the
   latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental
   reciprocity or `tit for tat' reciprocity.
   In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact
   takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that
   reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity.
   This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from
   charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from
   the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity
   actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of
   traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The
   mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but
   one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and
   Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are
   here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least
   partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of
   benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not
   explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and
   exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers
   for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched
   inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the
   problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well
   as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine.
   But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more
   as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional
   features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle.
   Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in
   regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for
   solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from
   contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use.
   This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural
   background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged.
   Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that
   may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a
   political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that
   solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of
   domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in
   doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an
   instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is
   properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather
   than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic
   account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement
   solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social
   movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at
   agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the
   form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with
   the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have
   implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and
   for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical
   notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading
   that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or
   community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to
   compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently
   does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside
   these groups' borders.
   Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are
   transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be
   found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational
   relationships take a networked form and involve relations to
   `outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both
   generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have
   recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human
   solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the
   notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as
   underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is
   explicitly understood as `weak solidarity,' namely, `the willingness to
   take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the
   requirement `to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic
   of `strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or
   in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson
   explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and `caring
   for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing
   inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the
   Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a
   notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is
   sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the
   appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we
   find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
   where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply
   certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A
   related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the
   Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes
   a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international
   cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health
   research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go
   further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize
   these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of
   solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely
   the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx
   emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of
   solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for
   healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense
   is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among
   citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among
   members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call
   networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not
   necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to
   work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The
   first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated
   with the motto of the three musketeers: `One for all and all for one,'
   but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it.
   Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as
   involving a clear awareness of a `we' or `us'. Although some sense of a
   `we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it
   applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see.
   In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by
   Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective
   activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with
   an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as
   `similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the
   first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in
   an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants
   necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally
   committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability
   as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a
   pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but
   may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing `we' in the context of
   collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not
   aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but
   arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of
   overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least
   partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are
   not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or
   institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception
   of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as
   will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social
   ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having
   normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an
   instance of what I have elsewhere called `common activities,' the norms
   go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group
   whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of
   the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the
   group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere
   that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in
   processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should
   also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This
   follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed `equal
   positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of
   self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these
   necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency,
   no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common
   activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them.
   In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set
   of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of
   these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the
   norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and
   majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining
   group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence
   and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group
   solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative
   activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We
   can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad
   range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's
   interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents
   requires a set of conditions, both material and social.
   Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized
   negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of
   conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as
   individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive
   freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as
   well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals'
   fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared
   needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not
   only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the
   Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity
   itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities
   that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely,
   but also can be said to constitute `the other side of justice' (in
   Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's
   pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function
   in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and
   their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals.
   The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political
   communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such
   communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the
   requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further,
   the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the
   shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of
   domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided
   forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as
   they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here
   are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large
   groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination
   on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics.
   Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the
   relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such
   demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not
   external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by
   Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely
   pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and
   community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it.
   These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more
   evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called
   networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social
   movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of
   labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these
   movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly
   evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking
   solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive
   relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also
   apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is
   generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but
   may also include networking to help alleviate suffering.
   As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have
   elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the
   understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such
   solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily
   involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in
   support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a
   common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to
   justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to
   involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged,
   we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an
   expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More
   direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as
   well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among
   people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of
   networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity
   requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves
   understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody
   democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their
   equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching
   goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that
   motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as
   they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to
   realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise
   or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate
   and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to
   have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity
   actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or
   set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or
   suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking
   and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they
   offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups
   or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be
   regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from
   an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the
   first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by
   the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former
   involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals)
   undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then,
   we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as
   manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The `we' in the
   case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by
   its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular
   cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination,
   oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly
   defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the `we' should
   remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor
   solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved
   shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as
   exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as
   group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to
   outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states.
   Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of
   solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive
   rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders
   are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be
   regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so
   than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in
   principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work
   toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be
   admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are
   unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global
   justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or
   systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many
   solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion
   of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking
   solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing
   justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of
   injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups,
   if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human
   rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice.
   That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce
   injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight
   the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the
   specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such
   exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight
   on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure
   and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the
   underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the
   requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor.
   Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of
   objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of
   intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by
   others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces
   elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether
   individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but
   the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect
   existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for
   action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes
   of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with
   prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the
   capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often
   only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always
   be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.)
   More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to
   injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris
   Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices
   through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens
   focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted
   consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and
   reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by
   impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the
   existing housing stock.
   According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people
   as a result of structural processes in which many people participate.
   These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to
   the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible
   to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions
   and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure,
   Young argues, turns our attention to `how the institutions of a society
   work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of
   domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social
   positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later
   work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that
   connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social
   and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which
   people stand give rise to what she calls a `forward looking' sense of
   political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with
   others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can
   observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social
   life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary
   political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the
   power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also
   criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether
   workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and
   practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather,
   some have substantial control over the processes to which others are
   subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take
   structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the
   formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism
   and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social
   life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of
   inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they
   produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a
   thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions
   have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those
   characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what
   Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of
   solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as
   described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts
   as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give
   way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance
   for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with
   the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may
   generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these
   injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways
   that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential
   if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where
   solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly
   attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of
   the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if
   the solidarity actions are to be effective.
   For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to
   mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions
   that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately
   affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the
   ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural
   events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and
   even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are
   insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the
   impacts of the structural features of political economy and the
   injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This
   is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly
   at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor.
   In such cases, effective action must not only support workers
   individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially
   critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the
   exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of
   how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in
   healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an
   expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and
   in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from
   its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here
   is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims
   only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that
   simply `incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the
   Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice,
   these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that
   social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to
   deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to
   pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development
   and for participating in processes of collective self-determination.
   This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking
   solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary
   contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g.,
   among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented
   over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that
   solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep
   social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global,
   justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity
   remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and
   specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of
   universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their
   particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader
   goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to
   empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of
   solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social
   context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural
   injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional
   context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity
   movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated
   within these movements themselves.
   I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective
   about these effects of the structural context in which they function,
   and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in
   its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be
   mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the
   impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although
   solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need
   to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity
   action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other
   solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional
   changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and
   various political and economic transformations are also needed. But
   solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or
   interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of
   constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some
   cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of
   solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on
   solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and
   Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further
   benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to
   justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or
   systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare
   and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on
   only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of
   healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of
   practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take
   seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the
   individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners
   or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the
   solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that
   understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not
   only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx
   consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely
   different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those
   authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to
   assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks
   to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving
   healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to
   protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of
   healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of
   structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies
   evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system).
   Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow
   citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes
   to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary
   considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded
   support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along
   with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the
   universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of
   people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an
   understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice.
   There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural
   provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order
   to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth
   mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do
   nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is
   particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that
   private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally
   at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European
   countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones
   in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States
   is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice,
   rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among
   compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance
   industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is
   immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As
   part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms
   also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug
   companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the
   `power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society,
   which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law.
   Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the
   wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can
   also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human
   needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the
   systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on
   their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic
   functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the
   redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities.
   Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce
   to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many
   adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic
   injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic
   identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the
   political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful
   change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to
   equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can
   probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background
   structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of
   genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic
   economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social
   movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United
   States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in
   solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health
   insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage
   altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in
   the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to
   develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required.
   Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and
   Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading
   the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts
   to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
   They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was
   under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in
   various locales across the United States, including rural areas and
   those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health
   insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing
   non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more
   global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been
   important for understanding and addressing the social and economic
   factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters,
   e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas
   solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and
   motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that
   exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations
   expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking
   justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural
   injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in
   insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the
   health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes.
   Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself
   has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only
   increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural
   injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to
   causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have
   responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well
   known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African
   Americans made up 80\% of the people in flooded low-lying communities,
   sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the
   means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car
   ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part
   of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced
   abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the
   grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered
   each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups
   like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including
   founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A
   related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New
   Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and
   helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various
   communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the
   storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly
   contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which
   over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than
   1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were
   impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly
   vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International
   Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding
   decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health
   systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where
   there were radically insufficient medical supplies available.
   In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75\% of Haiti's
   healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply
   system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved
   a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations
   (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian
   authorities, and over 90\% of the aid money went to international
   actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid,
   too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and
   between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In
   contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the
   quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in
   solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in
   Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of
   structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by
   Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017.
   This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and
   social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years
   of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along
   with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with
   inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the
   storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the
   recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were
   exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which
   was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under
   the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti,
   we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the
   capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare
   workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto
   Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts,
   but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S.
   government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires
   understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's
   life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by
   their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of
   capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete
   natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single
   solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects,
   establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper
   structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or
   vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going
   forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the
   present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the
   situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question
   but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going
   forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements
   and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would
   be necessary for the social transformative changes required.
   Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy
   structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central
   national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean
   water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water
   supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of
   Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in
   support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017.
   Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and
   cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of
   other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable
   epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of
   health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave
   labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up
   with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the
   profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social
   and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty.
   Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself,
   we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity
   movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and
   including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are
   the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org,
   among many others. In the international context, mention should also be
   made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising
   from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war
   and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts
   have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the `White Helmets'
   operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the
   rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is
   composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise
   eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's
   Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units
   operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case,
   since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full
   discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the
   present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases
   analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens
   of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation
   of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While
   less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity
   needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural
   injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues
   for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of
   governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine
   and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis,
   Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial
   uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of
   these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish
   to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ
   the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the
   use of these databases.
   For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at
   the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented
   purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also
   tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a
   given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of
   solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the
   present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private
   profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the
   scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and
   legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to
   implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is
   constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative
   structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to
   assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed,
   one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek,
   as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can
   actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident
   especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data.
   Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural
   feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the
   solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of
   these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they
   would decide against contributing their own information, despite
   assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward
   an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the
   very existence and continuation of these structural background
   conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice,
   if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of
   solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I
   have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and
   their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about
   dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute
   their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is
   supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these
   databases and they argue that only `broad consent' is needed for the use
   of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of
   informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly
   in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given
   to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential
   discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating
   or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of
   their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer
   efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead
   placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries
   arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of
   information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and
   practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be
   aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and
   limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal
   health data for use in medical databases.
   This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise
   people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these
   untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also
   essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame
   these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and
   their openness to corporate use of the included health information in
   the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in
   safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be
   meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow
   contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of
   possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research
   the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social,
   technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks
   requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides
   the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and
   Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included
   among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large
   databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up
   of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have
   conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks.
   This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed
   to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background
   functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and
   other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are
   also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are
   overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the
   specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance
   boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly
   solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be
   drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly
   also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other
   experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for
   the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them
   would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the
   feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an
   adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those
   one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs
   and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from
   them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps
   quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use
   the qualification `quasi' here to indicate that the input in question
   may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for
   formal rights of participation on governance boards by some
   representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of
   deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on
   the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the
   Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of `personalized
   medicine' or `precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of
   analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to
   individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of
   genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson.
   The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be
   important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the
   parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in
   personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the
   intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated
   individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the
   characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to
   include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal
   preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics
   and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly
   important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what
   constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account
   suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and
   potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for
   standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender,
   race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting
   groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians
   identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural
   preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account
   and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx
   propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of
   participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested
   follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and
   hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted.
   Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at
   evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large
   databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from
   patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the
   basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly
   shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input.
   This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine
   and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role
   of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that
   solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and
   goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their
   own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies,
   a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise
   therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of
   health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also
   require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's
   social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that
   social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and
   inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic
   institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice. The author

   Ibid., p. 115. Ibid., p. 119. INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF
   SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO
   JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR
   HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has
   recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the
   motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical
   needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a
   recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear
   costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for
   governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation.
   More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for
   `standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also
   distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in
   order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the
   understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is
   unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of
   structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding
   solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social
   movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group
   with `networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of
   structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including
   countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic
   exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare,
   discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the
   solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural
   disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by
   structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they
   engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health
   databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of
   solidarity in view.},
