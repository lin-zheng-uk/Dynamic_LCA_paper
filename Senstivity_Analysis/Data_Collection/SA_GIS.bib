Abstract = {Purpose This research presents a methodology to characterize life cycle
   impact data (LCIA) of alternative construction materials outside of the
   European context.
   Methods This methodology was based on the characterization of data and
   life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS),
   which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose.
   The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by
   different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by
   the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national
   transport at the country level; and local, represented by external
   factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A
   comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The
   functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m(2) core shelter unit
   consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five
   designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material:
   bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and
   soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions' variability and uncertainty
   analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The
   effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed,
   and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed.
   Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three
   levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for
   each country.
   Results and discussion The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block
   and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the
   construction materials' transport distance. Therefore, the level of
   impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a
   high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in
   most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be
   achieved with low environmental impacts.
   Conclusions The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA
   data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of
   consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately
   represent the range of production practices used outside Europe.
   Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment
   of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its
   highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design
   and recognising the structural needs in specific locations.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between energy use,
   geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied
   worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle
   impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed
   and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to
   the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life
   cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy
   consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable
   variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations
   (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The
   variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with
   life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better
   understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of
   building energy consumption in the context of green building rating
   systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems
   approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market
   transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into
   consideration both energy sources and building efficiency.},

Title = {A building information modeling-based tool for estimating building
   demolition waste and evaluating its environmental impacts},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {159-169},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The amount of building demolition waste produced in China is large, and
   waste treatment processes discharge many pollutants. Pre-evaluating
   waste's environmental damage at the design stage of building projects
   could provide an opportunity to understand and minimize potential
   environmental impacts. Tools that can conveniently estimate the amount
   of demolition waste and quantify its impacts are lacking. This study
   combines building information modeling (BIM), geographic information
   system (GIS), and life cycle assessment (LCA) to develop an estimation
   and evaluation system for building demolition waste. In this system, BIM
   digitizes the specific characteristics of the evaluated buildings and
   provides geometric and semantic information for waste estimation. GIS
   offers geographic information regarding waste treatment plants and
   landfill site, and is used to design waste transportation routes. LCA
   provides an environmental impact assessment framework and quantifies
   ecological damage impacts and resource depletion impacts due to
   demolition waste. The system includes five modules, which form the basis
   of an automated calculation tool. The evaluation tool can quickly
   quantify the amount of waste and assess its impacts, while achieving
   automated waste estimation and impact evaluation after a building is
   designed. A building in a middle school is taken as a case study to
   demonstrate and verify the system. This study provides an operable tool
   for waste evaluation and management at the design stage. With the
   increasing application of BIM technology in the construction industry,
   this tool is expected to gain popularity and promote efficient waste
   management.},

Title = {Climate Adaptation Heuristic Planning Support System (HPSS): Green-Blue
   Strategies to Support the Ecological Transition of Historic Centres},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The issue of climate has posed major and urgent challenges for the
   global community. The European Green Deal sets out a new growth strategy
   aimed at turning the European Union into a just and prosperous society,
   with a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy, which will
   no longer generate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cities in this
   context are committed on several fronts to rapid adaptation to improve
   their resilience capacity. The historic centre is the most vulnerable
   part of a city, with a reduced capacity for adaptation, but also the
   densest of values, which increase the complexity of the challenge. This
   study proposes an integrated tool, Heuristic Planning Support System
   (HPSS), aimed at exploring green-blue strategies for the historic
   centre. The tool is integrated with classic Planning Support System
   (PSS), a decision process conducted from the perspective of heuristic
   approach and Geographic Information System (GIS). It comprises modules
   for technical assessment, environmental assessment Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA), economic assessment Life Cycle Cost (LCC), Life Cycle Revenues
   (LCR), and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) extended to the life
   cycle of specific interventions, the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT)
   for the assessment of energy, environmental, identity, landscape, and
   economic values. The development of a tool to support the ecological
   transition of historic centres stems from the initiative of researchers
   at the University of Catania, who developed it based on the preferences
   expressed by a group of decision makers, that is, a group of local
   administrators, scholars, and professionals. The proposed tool supports
   the exploration of green-blue strategies identified by decision makers
   and the development of the plan for the historic district of Borgata di
   Santa Lucia in Syracuse.},

Abstract = {City informationization is the future trend of urban planning and city
   management, in which the concept of digital cities in recent years been
   repeatedly mentioned. 3D models and geographic information system (GIS)
   are the most important parts to describe a digital city in multi-rate,
   multi-scale and space-time dimensions, namely the use of information
   technology to simulate city's past, present and future on digital and
   virtual implementation. However, 3D models without the buildings'
   internal information cannot provide sufficient information support to a
   digital city. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has complete
   information of a building's whole life cycle. Therefore, integration of
   BIM and GIS is the future trend of urban management.
   This paper reviews the features of BIM and GIS, discusses their
   advantages and weaknesses in this context, and then proposes the concept
   of integration of BIM models and GIS. However, there will be many
   problems to face in order to combine BIM and GIS. An Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) standard has been proposed to solve these problems. This
   paper also reviews the IFC standard and its application in conversion of
   BIM models. By comparison of three different IFC formats which were
   converted from a BIM model established by Autodesk Revit Architecture,
   some significant losses of details have been found in the converting
   process. Meanwhile, how to integrate BIM models and GIS has been
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40\% of the final energy use and one third
   of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. At the city scale, a quantitative
   assessment of the environmental impact of buildings is essential to
   support sustainable energy policies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has
   been widely used to assess building related environmental impacts;
   however, its extension to the urban scale is still hampered by several
   operational challenges. Coupling LCA and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) has been identified as a promising solution but developments are
   still needed.
   This paper presents an automated approach for the energy modelling and
   LCA of urban housing stocks based on GIS. The main steps of the approach
   are the following: (i) GIS-based building stock characterization; (ii)
   automated building-by-building energy analysis; (iii) Environmental
   impact calculation via LCA. The approach was applied to the test case
   city Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) to assess the potential environmental
   impact reduction driven by housing retrofitting.
   Results were provided building-by-building and displayed as maps for
   improved communication. An energy savings potential of 35.3\% and a
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) reduction of 30.8\% were calculated as
   results of retrofitting. The average contribution of the retrofitting
   stage on the residual life of the building stock is 4 to 10\% of the
   GWP, depending on the building type.
   The study provided one of the first models able to perform a
   fully-fledged LCA of buildings at the urban scale in a bottom-up
   fashion. The results are meant to support local authorities in setting
   priority strategies for environmental impact reduction.},

Abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable
   materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of
   carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural
   resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major
   contributor towards climate change and given that the construction
   industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial
   to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the
   context of developing countries. This research presents a novel
   framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information
   modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information
   systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize
   construction's design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and
   waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in
   Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and
   a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have
   been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of
   available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied
   emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to
   disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses.
   Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an
   optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization
   tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The
   case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the
   results show that 29.35\% of the materialization stage, 16.04\% of the
   operational stage, and 21.14\% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions
   can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental
   degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle
   might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective
   environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {The building sector represents one of the major sources of environmental
   impact due especially to space and domestic hot water heating and
   construction works. A number of studies focused so far on estimating the
   energy savings and carbon emissions reduction potential achievable by
   retrofitting urban building stocks, nevertheless a shift to life cycle
   assessment is needed to properly assess the environmental impacts in a
   more holistic way.
   The aim of this study is to develop a geospatial data model for the life
   cycle assessment of environmental impacts of building stocks at the
   urban scale. The methodology includes: geospatial processing of
   building-related data to characterize urban building stocks; a
   spatio-temporal database to store and manage data; life cycle assessment
   to estimate potential environmental impacts.
   The methodology was tested for a case study in Luxembourg and
   preliminary results regarding the retrofitting stage of residential
   buildings were provided for one entire city. The data model is part of a
   wider bottom-up framework being developed to support decision about
   building stock retrofitting for sustainable urban planning.},

Abstract = {The integration of building information modelling (BIM) and geographic
   information system (GIS) in construction management is a new and fast
   developing trend in recent years, from research to industrial practice.
   BIM has advantages on rich geometric and semantic information through
   the building life cycle, while GIS is a broad field covering
   geovisualization-based decision making and geospatial modelling.
   However, most current studies of BIM-GIS integration focus on the
   integration techniques but lack theories and methods for further data
   analysis and mathematic modelling. This paper reviews the applications
   and discusses future trends of BIM-GIS integration in the architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry based on the studies of 96
   high-quality research articles from a spatio-temporal statistical
   perspective. The analysis of these applications helps reveal the
   evolution progress of BIM-GIS integration. Results show that the
   utilization of BIM-GIS integration in the AEC industry requires
   systematic theories beyond integration technologies and deep
   applications of mathematical modeling methods, including spatio-temporal
   statistical modeling in GIS and 4D/nD BIM simulation and management.
   Opportunities of BIM-GIS integration are outlined as three hypotheses in
   the AEC industry for future research on the in-depth integration of BIM
   and GIS. BIM-GIS integration hypotheses enable more comprehensive
   applications through the life cycle of AEC projects.},

Title = {The role of interdisciplinarity in evaluating the sustainability of

Journal = {FUTURE OF FOOD-JOURNAL ON FOOD AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Recently, urban agriculture (UA) has expanded throughout cities of the
   developed world as a response to social injustices and environmental
   gaps of the globalized food system (including food security, economic
   opportunities and community building). Due to the limiting factors of
   the urban environment (e.g., land availability), UA often occupies the
   roofs of buildings as vacant space to further develop local food
   production through so-called urban rooftop agriculture (URA). This paper
   presents an interdisciplinary scheme employed to evaluate the
   sustainability of URA as a complex system while investigating the
   potential of URA in quantitative and qualitative terms as well as the
   environmental and economic impact of different types of URA. The
   implementation of URA, as a specific form of UA, in a Mediterranean
   context was assessed using Barcelona, Spain and Bologna, Italy as case
   studies. Interdisciplinary methods from four disciplines were combined:
   (a) qualitative research to identify the potential of URA by evaluating
   the perceptions of different stakeholders; (b) geographic information
   systems (GIS), to quantify the potential area for implementing URA; (c)
   life cycle assessment (LCA), to quantify the environmental impacts of
   URA forms; and (d) life cycle costing (LCC), to quantify the economic
   costs of URA forms. According to the results, a combined GIS-LCA tool is
   useful in evaluating the implementation of URA and the consequent
   environmental benefits at the city scale. Stakeholders highlighted the
   contribution of URA to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well
   as the potential risks tied to its complexity and novelty. Comparing
   different urban spaces, the implementation of URA is more feasible in
   the short-term on the roofs of retail parks than industrial ones. At the
   system scale, soil cultivation with compost in open-air rooftop gardens
   resulted in the most eco-efficient cultivation option. Open-air rooftop
   gardens had lower environmental impacts and economic costs than rooftop
   greenhouses. LCA and LCC results outlined the relevance of decisions in
   the design phase regarding cultivation technique, crop choice and
   management.},

Abstract = {An analytical approach is often taken to predict the performance of
   renewable energy systems at a site, but an analytic approach requires
   detailed information on the system to be modeled that is better
   determined during schematic design than guessed-at during pre-design.
   This paper describes a heuristic approach to identify and prioritize
   renewable energy project opportunities before detailed system
   information is available. The method determines the combination of
   renewable energy technologies that minimize life-cycle cost at a
   facility, often with a specified goal regarding percent of energy use
   from renewable sources. Technologies include: photovoltaics (PV); wind;
   solar thermal heat and electric; solar ventilation air preheating; solar
   water heating; biomass heat and electric (combustion, gasification,
   pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion); and daylighting. The method rests upon
   the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) capabilities in:
   characterizing of the empirical cost and performance of technologies;
   geographic information systems (GIS) resource assessment; and life-cycle
   cost analysis. For each technology, simple heuristic algorithms relate
   renewable energy resources at a site to annual energy delivery with
   coefficients that are determined empirically. Initial cost and operation
   and maintenance (O\&M) cost also use empirical data. Economic
   performance is then calculated with a site's utility rates and
   incentives. The paper discusses how to account for the way candidate
   technologies interact with each other, and the solver routine used to
   determine the combination that minimizes life-cycle cost. Results
   include optimal sizes of each technology, initial cost, operating cost,
   and life-cycle cost, including incentives from utilities or governments.
   Results inform early planning to identify and prioritize projects at a
   site for subsequent engineering and economic feasibility study. Case
   studies include industrial sites, military bases, and civic buildings.},

Title = {Carbon emission evaluation of prefabricated concrete composite plates
   during the building materialization stage},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Modern prefabricated building technology can save resources, shorten the
   construction period, improve quality, and reduce pollution and carbon
   emissions. This study investigated the carbon footprint of prefabricated
   con-crete composite (PCC) plates at the project materialization stage.
   The joint application of three techniques conducted data analysis and
   computation: (a) the life cycle assessment (LCA) method providing the
   overall conceptual framework, building information modeling (BIM)
   technology designing the PCC-plates and gener-ating the component list,
   and geographic information system (GIS) software computing the spatial
   distribution of carbon footprint. A holistic carbon footprint accounting
   model was established for PCC plates' three materiali-zation substages
   (component-production, transport-logistics, and
   construction-installation) to comprehensively evaluate their quantity
   and distribution of carbon emissions. A detailed case study was
   conducted to test the proposed method and verify empirical findings. The
   results indicated: (1) the maximum difference between cases amounted to
   92.72 kgCO2/m2; (2) the carbon intensity per unit height was about
   18,182.15 kgCO2/m, and the unit cost was about 8469.01 kgCO2/10,000
   Yuan; and (3) the prefabrication rate, carbon emission per unit area and
   per unit cost were significantly correlated, indicating quantitative
   contributions of using more PCC to carbon footprint reduction. This
   research can assess the carbon emission of PCC at different construction
   substages with a good confidence level. The findings can provide a
   policy reference for the government and the industry to promote and
   rationalize PCC use and offer the basis to reduce the carbon footprint
   and sustainability of pre-fabricated construction.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global
   construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time,
   improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It
   is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However,
   there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced
   technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in
   prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi
   -information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG
   emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the
   production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The
   results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for
   the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77
   kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively,
   with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated
   components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest
   share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11\%, while the transportation
   and construction phases contribute 3.30\% and 0.59\% of the total
   emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of pre-fabricated
   construction can lead to a 31.62\% reduction in total GHG emissions per
   square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to
   traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study
   contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for
   calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of
   GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings.
   These findings can serve as practical references for future research to
   achieve the construction industry's green and low -carbon goals.},

Title = {A spatiotemporally differentiated product system modelling framework for
   consequential life cycle assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {333},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) applied to systems under
   continuous evolution, such as cities, usually disregard interactions
   among local components, how policy decisions influence them, and the
   value of spatial data. As a result, local environmental impacts might
   not be well-considered. This paper investigates how a spatially explicit
   system dynamics (SD) modelling approach can overcome such limitation,
   contributing to the advancement of CLCA. First, a novel CLCA conceptual
   framework is presented combining consequential life cycle inventories,
   SD principles and the use of spatially explicit data. Second, its
   innovative value is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept SD-CLCA
   model. This model evaluates the environmental impacts of changes in
   electricity supply-demand in the market due to an increasing adoption of
   solar photovoltaic panels (SPV) in residential buildings. It allows
   traceability of both system changes and their environmental
   consequences. For demonstration purposes, the SD-CLCA model is applied
   to Lisbon municipality and the broader electricity market of Portugal.
   Results showcase how SD-CLCA models could provide a closer
   representation of the real effects of predicted changes in the
   electricity market due to different SPV adoption scenarios. They also
   illustrate that changes in gross domestic product, population and
   precipitation provide a diversified set of impact scores. As a
   methodological advancement, and to the net of a few shortcomings, the
   proposed SD-CLCA model is able to capture the complexity of cause-effect
   dynamics determining environmental impacts, which currently represents a
   research gap in LCA.},

Title = {Tradeoff optimization of urban roof systems oriented to
   food-water-energy nexus},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {380},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Urban roof development serve as a form of urban tinkering that could
   provide favorable conditions to meet wicked food, water, and energy
   challenges. In this research, three urban roof systems are designed
   featuring food production, rainwater collection, building energy saving,
   and photovoltaic power generation, which are named the bare roof system,
   green roof system, and open-air farming roof system. Here we establish a
   generalizable framework to reveal the multifaceted tradeoffs of urban
   roof schemes integrating geographic information system, life cycle
   assessment, and multi-objective optimization and decision-making.
   Testing the framework in a typical compact city Shenzhen, China, results
   show that the rooftop suitability for food-water-energy function
   development within the city ranges from 26.21 \% to 42.83 \%. When
   implementing a city-wide roof system upscaling, the harvested rainwater
   on rooftops would contribute to 82.5 \% of urban recycled water
   utilization target in 2035 and exhibit the fewest economic costs, but
   comes at the cost of life cycle carbon emissions and land occupation
   with 1850 kt and 140 km2. City-wide roof farming scenario shows
   potential to achieve the local selfsufficiency of vegetables, and stands
   out as the avoided transboundary energy footprints which are 4.5 times
   greater than life cycle energy consumption. Our research can foster the
   multiple tradeoff understanding between upscaling roof systems and urban
   food-water-energy nexus. The findings will assist in multi-objective
   decisionmaking for roof planning and sustainable transition in cities.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of building stocks from urban to transnational
   scales: A review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {316-332},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy consumption
   and environmental impacts worldwide. An assessment of the energy demand
   and environmental performance of building stocks at large spatial scales
   is increasingly needed for decision support in sustainable planning and
   policy making. While current bottom-up building stock models mainly
   focus on the operational energy use, a new research trend has introduced
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a more holistic environmental
   performance assessment including several stages of the building life
   cycle.
   This paper reviews a set of selected bottom-up LCA studies evaluating
   the environmental impact of building stocks at several scales, from
   urban to transnational. The selected studies were analyzed according to
   three common elements: building stock aggregation model, energy analysis
   and LCA. Two main stock aggregation approaches, archetypes and
   building-by-building, are applied to model individual buildings and
   extrapolate results at the stock level. Bottom-up energy models, either
   statistical or engineering-based, provide energy profiles for the
   operational phase of buildings. LCA is subsequently performed to assess
   the building environmental performance and support policy decisions.
   Current limitations and opportunities for the improvement of the LCA of
   large building stocks are finally addressed and discussed to support
   future works. Building stock aggregation models may be enhanced by
   addressing model calibration, integration with Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) and stock dynamics models. Uncertainty propagation,
   sensitivity analysis and model simplification are recommended for energy
   models and LCA to bridge data gaps and reduce computationally intensive
   models. Future research is encouraged on the inclusion of climate
   change, evolution of the energy supply and integrated modeling for the
   LCA of building stocks.},

Title = {Coupling geospatial suitability simulation and life cycle carbon
   emissions towards uncertain optimization planning for
   wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {321},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Building clean and modern multi-energy complementary systems is a direct
   path to decarbonization in energy sector. The introduction of hydrogen
   energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy
   complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key
   issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen
   multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to
   finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system,
   consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process,
   and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the
   planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the
   following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation
   based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on
   probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration
   optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes
   the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective.
   The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization
   from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the
   system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon
   emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained
   only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional
   distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in
   this study decreased by 82.75 \%. In addition, considering that the
   system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can
   reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 \% but only increase costs by
   about 29.4 \%. The computational results justify the proposed
   optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the
   system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference
   for practice.},

Abstract = {Utility tunnel should be well maintained for it services public
   pipelines and city operation. In the recent time, utility tunnel has
   been operated via computer maintenance management systems (CMMS) or
   building automation systems (BAS). However, CMMS or BAS lack of
   convenient visualization and interoperability. This paper aims to
   propose an integrated system of building information modelling (BIM) and
   geographic information system (GIS) to improve the performance of
   current maintenance management system. A system framework of BIM-3DGIS
   is proposed and required maintenance management functions are also
   developed based on practice demands. A real case of utility tunnel is
   used to demonstrate the system. Two scenarios and a questionnaire survey
   are conducted to validate the applicability and practicability. Results
   show that the proposed BIM-3DGIS system can ensure effective maintenance
   works and have well potential applications.},

Title = {High-resolution temporal and spatial evolution of carbon emissions from
   building operations in Beijing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {376},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Building, a main greenhouse gas source, accounts for approximately 38\%
   of all carbon emissions, and whole-life -cycle carbon emissions from
   building operations account for 60\%-80\% of construction-related
   emissions. However, the high-resolution spatiotemporal distribution of
   building-operation carbon emissions is unclear. We developed a top-down
   method to calculate and map carbon emissions by (1) compiling a
   building-operations carbon-emission inventory that includes direct
   energy consumption and calculating the carbon emissions of four key
   energy-intensive sectors via an emissions-factor approach; (2) cleaning,
   reclassifying and assigning weights to POI data obtained from AutoNavi;
   and (3) using a GIS to obtain sectoral carbon emissions in each grid
   according to the POI weights and to overlay and map the total carbon
   emissions. In Beijing, overall carbon emissions peaked at 95.87 million
   tons (2012). Emissions showed a clustered core with a multicenter
   discrete radial distribution pattern. Additionally, the carbon emissions
   intensity peaked at 487.44 kg/m(2) (2015). The per -unit-grid carbon
   emissions distribution range was generally normally distributed, and the
   range of 10(3)-10(5) kg/ grid had the widest distribution and largest
   number of associated grids. Southeastern carbon emissions hotspots
   developed, and cold spots appeared along the periphery. This research
   could help planners quickly zone and reduce carbon emissions, leading to
   improved future development strategies.},

Abstract = {As the key for building the new power system and achieving the
   ``dual-carbon{''} goal, the development of electric vehicle industry is
   closely connected with the supporting and improvement of charging and
   swapping infrastructure. However, the difficult cost recovery and
   unbalanced regional development appeared due to the low utilization as
   well as nonstandard siting and sizing of charging and swapping
   infrastructure. In order to guide the investment and construction of
   charging and swapping infrastructure correctly and effectively, it is
   essential to conduct in-depth research with respect to siting and sizing
   of charging and swapping infrastructure at this stage. On the basis of
   Particle Swarm Optimization, this paper builds an optimization model of
   siting and sizing for the fast charging stations through dividing
   regions in accordance with the charging demand of electric taxi, the
   geographical information of inapplicable location and other factors. The
   case result indicates that the model proposed herein is capable of
   improving economic benefits of investment operators and guiding the
   investment and construction of AC charging piles by means of maximizing
   the net income of the charging station throughout full life cycle, and
   determining the geographic location of charging stations and the
   quantities of charging piles to be configured. After optimizing the
   location of charging stations, it can maximize life-cycle net incomes of
   675.86 million yuan and determine the optimized amounts of charging
   piles in each charing station are 159, 339 and 563, respectively.},

Abstract = {The Italian residential building stock consists of 12.2 million
   buildings, with 7.2 constructed post-World War II during the economic
   boom. These structures were designed without specific regulations for
   seismic safety, fire resistance, and energy efficiency, and today lies
   the current state of strong obsolescence. Therefore, energy
   refurbishment may not always be the best cost/benefit solution due to
   these intrinsic issues. Consequently, the transition to construction
   systems based on circular economy principles brings new opportunities
   and becomes key to proposing replacement interventions for this
   heritage. This paper presents a comparative GIS-based bottom-up approach
   to evaluate the lifecycle impact of residential building blocks,
   encompassing energy, environmental, and economic aspects. Two tools are
   introduced: one for measuring energy consumption and the other for
   quantifying the quantities of materials stored in buildings. This
   methodology permits comparing the new circular buildings and different
   refurbishment scenarios to identify the most suitable solution from an
   environmental impact and financial point of view. The application of a
   case study, a residential urban block in Bologna, built in 1945-1965,
   highlights how the demolition and reconstruction scenario based on
   circular economy principles presents the lowest environmental impacts
   and is economically competitive compared to standard deep renovation
   techniques.},

Abstract = {The environmental impacts of noise and vibration are becoming
   increasingly important in the assessment of new and upgraded railway
   routes. Vibration from railways propagates through the ground to nearby
   buildings where it may cause annoyance as feelable vibration or as
   re-radiated noise. To tackle the adverse effects of ground-borne noise a
   range of possible interventions are available, including softer rail
   pads, under-sleeper pads and under-ballast mats. The installation costs
   of such interventions are generally higher for the higher-performing
   track types. Additionally, there are potential effects on track
   maintenance costs which may be positive or negative, for example by
   reducing sleeper damage or increasing the need for ballast tamping. This
   study presents a socio-economic analysis of the effects of several
   interventions to reduce ground-borne noise. By selecting a whole route,
   the installation and whole-life costs are assessed using Network Rail's
   Vehicle-Track Interaction Strategic Model (VTISM) and these are offset
   against benefits in terms of reduced social costs. Ground-borne noise is
   predicted at various distances from the alignment using the Modelling of
   Train Induced Vibration (MOTIV) model and the effect of track
   interventions is determined as insertion loss spectra. The re-radiated
   noise within a typical domestic building is then estimated using generic
   building transfer functions. Geographic Information System tools are
   used to estimate the population affected by ground-borne noise and their
   expected level of exposure. The methodology is illustrated using a case
   study route between Brighton and Portsmouth in the South of England.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming a standard tool for
   information management throughout the life cycle of a construction
   project. Elements in BIM are designed in a Cartesian coordinate system
   (Engineering system) with no direct relation to the project's geographic
   location. Accurate georeferencing of BIM data is required both for
   construction and integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
   as improperly treated or neglected scale distortions can lead to costly
   delays in construction as problems requiring ad hoc solutions may arise
   on site Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is an open BIM standard
   developed by buildingSMART, and the current version IFC 4 has recently
   been extended with IFC Alignment, which includes support for alignment
   geometries used for infrastructure design. This paper investigates the
   geographic capabilities of IFC 4 and its extension IFC Alignment. The
   study identifies a lack of support for non-uniform scale factors and
   object-specific map projections as the largest weaknesses.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of information technology has brought several
   innovations to the field of civil engineering. BIM (Building Information
   Modeling) technology places emphasis on information integration and the
   establishment of a database. It also aims to realize the building
   life-cycle management. BIM technology is exerting a significant and
   profound impact on the design, construction, management, operation, and
   maintenance of building projects. In this study, the value of BIM in
   construction projects was analyzed, and the significant meaning of this
   study was elaborated. BIM standards and the data standard of IFC were
   discussed, and the important concepts of 4D-BIM and 5D-BIM were also
   presented. The key technologies like parameterization, visualization,
   geographic information system, building life cycle management, and
   clouding computing were analyzed. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviour
   of the building was analyzed, and the value of BIM in construction was
   expounded. Particularly, the application of BIM in bidding, BIM virtual
   construction, clash detection, and refined calculation about resources
   as well as materials were analyzed in this paper. Also, the construction
   dynamical management system of 4D-BIM was discussed. Finally, the
   coordination, which acts as an important issue between the BIM design
   and BIM construction, were analyzed comprehensively.},

Title = {Spatially optimized distribution of household rainwater harvesting and
   greywater recycling systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {312},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Household decentralized water systems, including rainwater harvesting
   and greywater recycling, are often touted as a means to improve the
   sustainability and resiliency of centralized municipal systems. This
   research is focused on the spatial distributions of life cycle energy
   savings, consumer cost savings, and percent demand met of decentralized,
   household rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater recycling (GWR)
   system adoptions when they are being optimized for either life cycle
   cost or energy savings. The city of Boston was used as a testbed for
   applying the modeling framework in this study. A dynamic model was
   developed for both RWH and GWR systems to simulate daily water and
   energy usages and savings over a 30-year time frame using Python. The
   cost and energy optimal sizes of the RWH and GWR systems for each
   residential building in Boston were calculated using the Brent's method.
   Household characteristics such as distance from the centralized plants,
   number of tenants, and roof size were either directly obtained through
   Boston GIS data or approximated based upon existing data. Overall, GWR
   systems were found to perform generally better than RWH systems across
   the entire Boston. An average life cycle cost saving of \$909-948/year
   and an average life cycle energy saving of 586-622 MJ/year can be
   achieved via installing cost- or energy-optimized GWR systems. The
   middle city area is generally good for both RWH and GWR system adoptions
   from both cost and energy perspectives. Incentives might be provided to
   foster decentralized system adoptions with infrastructure renovation
   efforts in this area. On the other hand, the southern sub-urban areas
   are generally the most suitable for installing RWH systems, while the
   downtown and its surrounding areas are generally the most suitable for
   promoting GWR systems. When taking stormwater management into
   consideration, the downtown area can also benefit from combined RWH and
   GWR systems as well as shared systems with local parks or other
   buildings with larger irrigation demands.},

Abstract = {SF6 gas insulated high voltage switchgear (GIS) has been installed in an
   increasing number over the last three decades. GIS covering the voltage
   range from 72,5kV to 800kV are now in service worldwide.
   The driving forces for installing GIS instead of traditional air
   insulated switchgear (AIS) were, among other the needs
   to cope with space limitation in densely populated urban areas
   (installations in buildings and underground)
   to increase availability in areas exposed to high atmospheric stress
   (pollution, extreme climatic conditions)
   to improve safety of operation in earthquake areas
   to meet special requirements of hydroelectric plants.
   Economic considerations and the progress in GIS technology have reduced
   the gap in the overall cost relationship between AIS and GIS and thus
   increased the application range of this technology. Besides the economic
   aspects such issues as the space saving potential, improved safety and
   reliability, favourable maintenance, increased service availability, and
   insensitivity to external disturbances have played a key role.
   This paper comparatively presents the major layout and design features
   of GIS and AIS and the related performance characteristics. These allow
   to determine functional advantages, to carry out life cycle cost (LCC)
   comparisons, and to assess environmental issues (LCA - life cycle
   assessment). For the value based comparison exemplified LCC has been
   given the main impact followed by performance issues and environmental
   impact.
   As a result GIS and AIS technology achieve similar ranking values,
   depending on the specific assessment. The optimisation of GIS technology
   with respect to lowest life cycle cost, highest availability and
   zero-maintenance has made GIS competitive with AIS not only at special
   application fields.},

Title = {Multi-sourced data modelling of spatially heterogenous life-cycle carbon
   mitigation from installed rooftop photovoltaics: A case study in
   Singapore},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {362},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Accurately quantifying carbon mitigation of operational photovoltaics
   (PVs) influenced by dynamic geoenvironment is crucial for developing
   suitable initiatives on renewable energy transition. However, previous
   studies made strong assumptions to avoid modelling spatial heterogeneity
   of carbon footprints or ignore weather and shadowing effects on PV
   electricity generation, making the estimated results unreliable and even
   causing false policymaking. To tackle this challenge, we developed a
   novel model coupling multi -sourced data modelling and life -cycle
   assessment to estimate spatially heterogenous carbon mitigation of all
   the operational rooftop PVs in an entire city. It is built by three
   hierarchal modules: (i) segmenting PV areas from high -resolution
   satellite imagery, by using Deep Solar PV Refiner, an advanced semantic
   segmentation network; (ii) estimating electricity generation in the
   segmented PV areas, by using a well -developed 3D solar irradiation
   model that considers the effects of land surface solar irradiation
   influenced by weather and shadowing effects produced by 3D buildings;
   (iii) quantifying carbon mitigation potential of PVs, by developing a
   spatial -aware life -cycle model to track the life -cycle carbon
   footprints of PVs from production, transportation, operation, to
   decommission. Investigating Singapore by 2020, we reveal that
   industrial, airport, and residential areas have the largest rooftop PV
   installation. We also suggest a carbon emission rate of 13.20 g-CO 2
   /kWh, a carbon payback time of 0.81 years, and an energy payback time of
   0.94 years, showing an improved carbon mitigation capability compared to
   the past years. This study contributes to GIS data modelling and helps
   understand the geospatial characteristics of urbanscale PV carbon
   mitigation.},

Title = {Life cycle inventory regionalization and uncertainty characterization: A
   multilevel modeling approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases are essential to evaluate the
   environmental burden of a product or service using life cycle assessment
   (LCA). The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results
   has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and
   quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is
   proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and
   uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to
   retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between
   the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and
   material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather
   than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The
   uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction
   interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer
   application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states
   from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed
   approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods.
   For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively,
   around 60\% and 80\% of variations within the datasets are explained by
   MLM, and 86.1\% and 96.8\% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the
   MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3\% and 70.5\% when
   traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95\% prediction
   intervals cover more than 95\% of measurement data in both input cases.
   It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for
   future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical
   information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. (c) 2019

Title = {Evaluation of the impact of urban morphology on commercial building
   carbon emissions at the block scale-A study of commercial buildings in
   Beijing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {408},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of cities, the proportion of building carbon
   emissions in the total carbon emissions of cities is increasing, and the
   carbon emission intensity of commercial buildings is higher than that of
   other building types. The relationship between commercial building
   life-cycle carbon emissions and urban form factors at the block scale
   and the spatial differentiation of building carbon emissions in
   commercial blocks remain unclear. In this study, a calculation method
   for building life-cycle carbon emissions in urban commercial blocks was
   established using (1) GIS technology to establish a commercial district
   building model and urban form factors and (2) block model classification
   according to architectural layout and combination as well as typical
   layout pattern extraction through morphological type. Additionally, (3)
   building life-cycle boundary and scenario parameters were determined,
   and the urban modeling interface (UMI) platform was used to numerically
   simulate block samples and typical layout modes for carbon emission
   calculation model construction. Beijing was chosen as a calculation and
   analysis example. The results indicated that building shape factor (BSF)
   is an important indicator of carbon emissions and that the impact of
   building density (BD) on carbon emissions is twosided. The spatial
   differentiation of carbon emissions is obvious, which could provide
   effective suggestions for target building planning. By studying carbon
   emission indicators under typical layout modes, we found that lowrise
   building + tower-enclosed (L + T-E) and low-rise building +
   tower-determinant (L + T-D) are the best layout modes.},

   environmental impacts of buildings. In order to investigate impacts of
   materials on a building level, we present a bottom-up building stock
   model that uses three-dimensional and geo-referenced building data to
   determine volumetric information of material stocks in Swiss residential
   buildings. We used a probabilistic modeling approach to calculate future
   material flows for the individual buildings. We investigated six
   scenarios with different assumptions concerning per-capita floor area,
   building stock turnover, and construction material. The Swiss building
   stock will undergo important structural changes by 2035. While this will
   lead to a reduced number in new constructions, material flows will
   increase. Total material inflow decreases by almost half while outflows
   double. In 2055, the total amount of material in- and outflows are
   almost equal, which represents an important opportunity to close
   construction material cycles. Total environmental impacts due to
   production and disposal of construction material remain relatively
   stable over time. The cumulated impact is slightly reduced for the
   wood-based scenario. The scenario with more insulation material leads to
   slightly higher material-related emissions. An increase in per-capita
   floor area or material turnover will lead to a considerable increase in
   impacts. The new modeling approach overcomes the limitations of previous
   bottom-up building models and allows for investigating building material
   flows and stocks in space and time. This supports the development of
   tailored strategies to reduce the material footprint and environmental
   impacts of buildings and settlements.},

Abstract = {Existing building stocks (BS) were not designed or constructed with
   circular economic (CE) strategies. Hence, recycling is vital in enabling
   CE in such BS. However, the lack of information about the scale and
   scope of the forecasted BS waste and its geo-located data hinders
   decisions on the selection of locations for recycling centres and proper
   landfills and evidence-based policy developments. BS mining, assisted
   with geographic information systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data are
   ideal for generating BS data and assisting end-of-life decisions for CE.
   However, the number of studies that have compared different BS data
   collection methods and analysis techniques is limited. This study
   investigates the research maturity of GIS, remote sensing, spatial
   analysis, and complementary methods adopted in BS mining and CE studies
   using a systematic literature review. As a critical outcome, a
   conceptual framework was developed to assist future BS mining, CE
   studies and industry practice.},

Title = {Developing a BIM GIS-Integrated Method for Urban Underground Piping
   Management in China: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Underground piping remains one of the key uncertain infrastructures in
   urban development. Because they are buried underground without a clear
   vision, the management of the underground piping system is more
   complicated than other infrastructure. Their records are not usually
   fully available or accurate, and excavation to validate underground
   structures is often needed in infrastructure projects. Detection of
   unexpected obstacles may lead to project delay, increased time spent,
   and risk of damaging existing piping. The traditional underground piping
   system management relies on computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and
   historical empiricism. Still, it cannot meet the strict requirements of
   infrastructure management nowadays or make the management efficient and
   sustainable because of the technical limitations and conceptual
   obsolescence. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper proposes an
   innovative method that aims to manage the underground piping life cycle.
   This method is to develop a building information model (BIM) in a
   geographic information system (GIS) environment by integrating
   heterogeneous data from both BIM and GIS, which not only achieves
   three-dimensional (3D) visualization but also seamlessly connects to
   portfolios, programs, projects, and assets throughout the life cycle of
   urban underground piping. This is a critical development to integrate
   and analyze geometric and nongeometric information of aboveground and
   subsurface building assets and the surrounding environment to stimulate
   interaction with real-world context. This paper also introduces a case
   study in China to further prove the feasibility of this method and the
   format based on it in practice. In the case study, the proposed method
   is implemented together with a piping sensor to further illustrate the
   effectiveness of the method over trenchless detection and real-time
   monitoring for daily management of underground piping. Because the model
   is visible and the monitoring is in real time, the management would be
   straightforward. At the same time, this method can analyze, plan, and
   monitor activity, so the management of urban underground piping systems
   would become smart. Therefore, an efficient and sustainable management
   performance can be achieved. This method is meaningful for managing the
   urban underground piping system, especially for those with expansion,
   refurbishment, or maintenance for an urban underground piping system.},

Title = {Optimal planning of a rooftop PV system using GIS-based reinforcement
   learning},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {298},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This study aimed to develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based
   reinforcement learning (RL) model for optimal planning of a rooftop PV
   system, considering the uncertainty of future scenarios throughout the
   life cycle of buildings. To that end, GIS was used to establish the
   spatial data for the rooftop PV installation, and an RL model was
   developed to maximize the economic profit of the rooftop PV installation
   in various locations and future scenarios. The developed model was
   applied to residential buildings in Nonhyeon district, South Korea to
   evaluate their economic profitability and to compare the model with the
   existing planning methods. With the use of the developed GIS-based RL
   model, the rooftop PV system became economically feasible, achieving
   average economic profit of 539,197 USD over all scenarios for all target
   buildings which was higher than that of the existing models by 4.4\% and
   4.3\%. Furthermore, the developed model outperformed the existing models
   especially in volatile scenarios with lower solar radiation. Therefore,
   the use of the proposed GIS-based RL model can optimize the economic
   feasibility of rooftop PV systems for buildings, which will benefit
   building owners and community-level energy business owners. In
   conclusion, the developed model can promote the adoption of rooftop PV
   systems, which have 91.8\% lower global warming potential than the
   Korean mixed grid, without additional subsidies to achieve Korea's
   national CO2 emission reduction plan.},

Abstract = {Tangerang local government's housing policy states that settlement area
   has to be rejuvenated through the `green housing' development. This
   study suggest that urban planning policy has to consider about carbon
   footprint as one of sustainability indicator. Many studies reviewed from
   socio-economic issues to figure whether the policy is sustainable whilst
   there is lack of consideration about carbon footprint per-capita
   emitted. Employing carbon metric, GIS and system dynamic methods, carbon
   footprint per-capita was estimated based on the implementation of green
   housing development. This study was focus on whole life cycle of
   building: construction phase, operational phase and demolition phase.
   Demolition would be conducted to settlement area which is not suitable
   with RTRW (urban land use planning). The result show that in the early
   year of policy implementation, there would be an increasing number of
   carbon footprint per capita due to the demolition and construction
   phases. However, in the long term carbon footprint per capita would be
   less cause by implementation of green housing. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {The stages of building construction vary with respect to activities and
   procedures. Execution schedules and two-dimensional (2D) drawings are
   commonly used to identify hazards in construction. Geographic
   information systems (GISs) can provide stakeholders, construction
   engineers and contractors with the required data during building
   construction. Planners can visualise 2D drawings and three-dimensional
   (3D) models using a GIS model that logically links their components with
   the activities in the schedule to establish the construction sequence.
   This study suggests the use of a GIS in building information modelling
   to construct a building construction information system by integrating
   2D drawings and 3D models with the activities database in the GIS model.
   GIS modelling can be used to generate and update schedules, databases
   and geospatial analyses within a single platform, which is a major
   requirement in the construction industry. Combining a GIS model in
   construction with its surrounding topography by linking 2D drawings and
   databases of activities or components of a building can produce a safe
   execution sequence. If a hazardous situation is identified during the
   analytical review process, it can be prevented within the GIS platform
   prior to the actual implementation. If defects are identified during and
   after construction, the cause of the defects and suitable mitigation can
   be determined. The methodology is tested using a real-life project in
   Riyadh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results conclude that GIS
   modelling can be employed to establish an information system for all
   stages of building construction and to create an archived system for
   efficient project documentation.},

Abstract = {Demolition waste represents a significant portion of the total generated
   waste and has a high importance from both a waste management and a
   resource efficiency perspective. The urban context is highly relevant to
   assess the environmental impact of the end-of-life stage of buildings
   and potential for future reduction to properly design corresponding
   demolition waste management strategies.
   The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the
   characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the
   potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of
   buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management
   strategies. The methodology combines a bottom-up material stock model
   based on geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial temporal
   database with life cycle assessment (LCA) for the evaluation of
   end-of-life scenarios.
   The approach was tested for the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg)
   and provided significant results on the quantity and the composition of
   the housing material stock. Two alternative scenarios involving
   recycling rates of respectively 50\% and 70\% for inert materials were
   assessed and an average reduction potential of 25.6\% on abiotic
   depletion potential and 9.2\% on global warming potential was estimated.

Abstract = {The present work is aimed at evaluating the influence of various factors
   - mainly number of users - on both energy and environmental features of
   a Health Centre by quantifying their incidence on the sizing of the
   building, as well as on energy consumption and its management.
   A total of 70 Health Centres located in eight Health Areas of
   Extremadura (a south western Region of Spain) were analyzed from both
   energy and environmental perspectives. In particular, the most
   influential parameters on buildings' daily management were studied.
   Also, a sensitivity analysis to establish empirical connections between
   energy indicators and the operating parameters was carried out. Finally,
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to explore possible
   correlations with other factors related to buildings' location. (C) 2011

   Analysis (LCA) tracks production, consumption and reuse of materials

   an emerging procedure to benchmark building relative to the environment
   using some techniques mentioned above but correlates them to a GIS
   input/output based modeling framework so that location sensitive issues
   regarding material and energy flows relative to environment and resource

   performance system in a site sensitive context. Site is defined in a
   multiple scalar measurement depending on resource and technology.},

Title = {``Papering{''} Over Space and Place: Product Carbon Footprint Modeling

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS},

Volume = {101},

Pages = {730-741},
Abstract = {We are witnessing an explosion in carbon calculators for estimating the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., carbon footprint) of households,
   buildings, cities, and processes. Seeking to capitalize on the emergent
   ogreeno consumer, corporations are leading the next iteration in carbon
   footprinting: consumer products. This potentially lucrative low-carbon
   frontier, however, faces steep challenges due to complexities of scale,
   largely a function of the number of actors and geographies involved in
   globalized commodity and energy networks, and scope, which increasingly
   demands inclusion of emissions due to land use change (e.g., biofuel
   production, timber harvest, livestock grazing, mining). Life cycle
   assessment (LCA)the principal method behind product-level GHG emissions
   footprint protocolsfrequently avoids these challenges by narrowly
   delineating system boundaries, thereby excluding the omessinesso of
   space and place. Through a comparative model of energy sources and
   emissions in the globalized paper industry, this article reveals how
   complexities associated with geographic variation and land use change
   create indeterminacy in footprints based on these protocols. Using
   industry and trade data, the authors develop geographic information
   system transportation and energy models to map the globally dispersed
   pulp supply networks and to rescale Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change GHG inventory guidelines to include carbon loss associated with
   land use change in the carbon footprint of coated paper. Given their
   integrative abilities to conceptualize and model coupled
   human-ecological systems, sophisticated understanding of time-space
   dynamics and critical theoretical insights, geographers have much to
   contribute to the LCA and product carbon footprinting enterprise, which
   to date has been largely the intellectual domain of engineers.},

Abstract = {The increasing global industrialization and over-exploitation of fossil
   fuels has induced the release of greenhouse gases, leading to an
   increase in global temperature and causing environmental issues. There
   is therefore an urgent necessity to reach net-zero carbon emissions.
   Only 4.5\% of countries have achieved carbon neutrality, and most
   countries are still planning to do so by 2050-2070. Moreover, synergies
   between different countries have hampered synergies between adaptation
   and mitigation policies, as well as their co-benefits. Here, we present
   a strategy to reach a carbon neutral economy by examining the outcome
   goals of the 26th summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference
   of the Parties (COP 26). Methods have been designed for mapping carbon
   emissions, such as input-output models, spatial systems, geographic
   information system maps, light detection and ranging techniques, and
   logarithmic mean divisia. We present decarbonization technologies and
   initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, and we discuss carbon
   trading and carbon tax. We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as
   shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, and the
   development of low-carbon technologies, low-carbon agriculture, changing
   dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste.
   Developing resilient buildings and cities, introducing decentralized
   energy systems, and the electrification of the transportation sector is
   also necessary. We also review the life cycle analysis of carbon neutral
   systems.},

Title = {Material Classification and Reuse Framework Based on the Reverse

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {After natural resources are mined, they are stored in cities in the form
   of urban minerals through the construction of buildings. However,
   buildings have many negative impacts on nature from the time they are
   constructed and used to the end of their life cycles when they are
   demolished and discarded. At present, many researchers have conducted
   research on the recycling of buildings, including the whole life cycle
   of buildings, the value assessment of the construction waste, the
   recycling boundary of the construction waste, and the way building waste
   could be reused. These studies all need to discuss the types of
   construction waste and their total volume. Urban mining uses GIS data
   (top-down) and the same type of building material per unit area
   (bottom-up) to provide a broad calculation method for the construction
   waste, but it fails to accurately obtain the exact amount of each
   material of the building. From the perspective of architectural design,
   the same type of buildings tend to have different spaces and structures
   due to factors such as the site, orientation, and function. These all
   affect the way construction waste is reused. This paper aims to create a
   framework for the reuse of construction waste to improve the accuracy
   and diversity of the reuse of construction waste in the future. The main
   purpose of this article is to provide a more accurate assessment of the
   material which is contained in a building. Using a 48-year-old office
   building in the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Laboratory (TCCLab) as the
   research case study, the paper compares the data calculated by different
   methods and verifies the difference between the bottom-up and the
   disassembly classification method proposed in this study. According to
   the architectural design principles, the authors first carried out a 3D
   digital modeling of the office building (including the building
   structure) using a forward construction sequence and then they proposed
   the framework of the material classification and the reuse of the
   reinforced concrete (RC) of the office building using the method of
   reverse disassembly, hoping to provide a reference for the reuse of
   construction waste.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) data provide geospatial data on
   cities and spatial analysis functions that are essential for urban
   design. Building information modeling (BIM) includes a digital entity of
   construction, a passive presentation of micro-digital information on
   real entities, and an active application of models in the entire life
   cycle realization of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industries. A combination of these technologies could provide a core
   technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city
   design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes
   the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional
   integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the
   ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in
   the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart
   cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and
   co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and
   BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional
   disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of
   GIS and BIM integration. Future research should focus on smart city
   planning, updating, management; ontology-based GIS and BIM data
   integration platform; and operation; and the collaborative management of
   urban rail transportation engineering.},

Abstract = {The residential heritage that was built during the great expansion of
   real estate after the Second World War has severe deficiencies in
   structural safety, fire resistance, energy efficiency, and accessibility
   and these cannot be solved with sustainable renovation measures. This
   study focuses on replacement interventions and promotes a management
   model that addresses three areas (technical, social, and economic) and
   it refers to the application of the circularity principle to the
   construction sector for the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The
   final objective is to define a protocol-namely, the guidelines-to
   reference in a decision-making process that promotes urban regeneration
   by comparing demolition with reconstruction and renovation. The proposed
   methodology allows for the determination of suitable areas in Bologna
   for replacement and the joining of the municipal geodatabase with data
   from archival research on building permits in 1949-1965 by using GIS
   software. This digital archive can be implemented in a digital twin for
   an urban block, which can become a predictive tool for urban planning
   and the management of the whole life of a building. The main result is
   the characterization of urban blocks by identifying typical features
   belonging to specific building libraries that are validated with density
   analyses. These urban clusters and building archetypes can be used to
   assess targeted intervention measures by using specific tools, such as
   predictive maps and 3D city models.},

Title = {Integration of 3DGIS and BIM and its application in visual detection of

Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The multi-level modeling technology of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), combined with Three-dimensional Geographic Information System
   (3DGIS) macro-scene visualization technology and location information,
   can realize the transmission of decentralized information from various
   disciplines to multi-disciplinary collaborative information sharing
   services. It can be applied independently for the whole life cycle,
   which plays a positive role in reducing the cost and improving the
   efficiency of engineering planning, design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance. In this paper, the data integration and function
   integration methods of 3DGIS and BIM are designed. In order to avoid the
   breaking problems caused by attribute information loss and excessive
   simplification in the process of BIM data integration, the attribute
   mapping between 3DGIS and BIM based on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) and the data simplification
   method considering the geometric characteristics of BIM are designed. By
   setting the relevant preconditions and thresholds of patch merging, on
   the premise of maintaining the structural characteristics of BIM data
   surface, reduce the amount of model data to improve the efficiency of
   BIM data loading, rendering and display effect in 3D geospatial scene.
   Through the data and function integration of 3DGIS and BIM, we can
   effectively manage the data of large-scale model, and calculate and
   obtain the geospatial location and direction of key parts of buildings
   through the coordinate transformation of BIM, which can effectively
   assist the rapid and accurate positioning of BIM in virtual 3D scene and
   expand the visualization ability of 3DGIS. By effectively integrating
   3DGIS and BIM, this paper gives full play to the spatial management
   advantages of 3DGIS and the component management advantages of BIM. The
   rationality and operability of the method are verified by its
   application in the operation and maintenance management project of
   concealed facilities in actual buildings.},

Abstract = {In order to better play the role of information technology in the
   construction management of rail transit projects, we analyze the
   application of geographic information system (GIS) + building
   information modeling (BIM) technology in the construction management of
   rail transit projects by combining the characteristics of GIS+BIM
   technology and aiming at the overall improvement of project management
   efficiency and technical management methods. This study is mainly
   conducted with the support of BIM technology and sensing technology. In
   the design stage, carbon emissions are classified according to the
   source activities of building carbon emissions, and the carbon emissions
   in the building life cycle are quickly calculated by using BIM
   technology, and the design is optimized according to the analysis of the
   budget results. The experimental results prove that the low-carbon
   building evaluation standard cloud model of allelectronic computer
   interlocking system for urban rail transit established in this study,
   combined with the comprehensive weighting results, calculates the
   low-carbon index cloud model and comprehensive cloud model, and derives
   the operational safety risk level of the all-electronic computer

   shows that GIS+BIM technology can realize the refinement and

Abstract = {Geospatial information modelling (GIM) is used for decades to document
   phenomena of the real world. Visualizing and analysing GIM data are
   usually accomplished by geographic information system tools. The
   construction industry, on the other hand, uses usually computer-aided
   design (CAD) tools to plan buildings. With the introduction of building
   information modelling (BIM), modelling in CAD was enhanced to the entire
   life cycle of constructions. BIM and GIM are not independent of each
   other, e.g. BIM uses geospatial data for planning purposes. However,
   integrating both is challenging since the modelling methods differ. The
   paper describes approaches to establish interoperability between models
   of both domains. A literature review reveals the problems and challenges
   different researchers tackled to achieve interoperability.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant increase in studies related to Industry 4.0
   alongside the development of new technologies, devices and software,
   becoming one of the most relevant topics for years within the so-called

   Construction sector (AEC) sector is one step behind other engineering
   fields in productivity, and digitalisation can help reduce this gap.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation in various project
   phases with other technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big Data,
   Blockchain or Geographic Information System (GIS) are the main drivers
   of Smart Construction. This paper provides an updated state-of-art of
   the BIM applications through different civil engineering projects and
   towards the use of new Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs). Hence, the integration of BIM in the Facility Management through
   ICTs allows decision making based on data analysis and the optimization

Title = {Use of GIS and BIM tools in determining the life cycle impact of urban
   systems. Case study: Residential buildings which apply the
   Eco-Efficiency Matrix in the city of Quito, Ecuador},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {383},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on
   changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction,
   which generates approximately 33\% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere
   and con-tributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present,
   interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of
   various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact.
   Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently
   linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75\% of carbon
   emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban
   concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically
   visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement
   routes were located according to the types of transport used and the
   location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as
   points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several
   tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level.
   The impact of the building in the production, construction,
   de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use
   of the three tools -LCA, BIM and GIS -allowed us to establish that the
   highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high
   consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in
   Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental
   impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore
   essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix,
   which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.},

Title = {ROAD MODELLING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT - THE EFFICIENT USE OF
   GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {438-457},
Abstract = {The construction sector is undergoing a digital transition. Local
   authorities have adopted geographic information systems (GISs) to plan
   their territories and structure their services, such as transport.
   Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has demonstrated
   its advantages during the design and construction phases of structures.
   An infrastructure project can rely on these two technologies to plan its
   implementation (GIS), to complete its design and construction (BIM), or
   to manage associated services, such as mobility (GIS). However, road
   maintenance, an important part of the infrastructure's life cycle, is
   not yet covered by these technologies. Road maintenance necessitates a
   comprehensive view of the infrastructure and its interactions with other
   real-world objects (e.g. vegetation, technical networks, or vehicles).
   Moreover, road managers are the local authorities that already use GISs.
   For these reasons, a GIS is suitable for fulfilling road maintenance
   requirements. This study presents a spatial framework (GIS) developed
   for road management. Applying it to a specific case study provides
   insights on the organisation of the spatial road framework which can be
   adapted to the infrastructure's environment management. The spatial
   dimension must allow for the representation of the road and its
   components, including pavements and their dependencies. The structural
   dimension must be detailed to describe the layers, their formulations,
   and their thicknesses. The condition of the road must be described
   concisely so that the managers can plan maintenance.},

Abstract = {Among the technological advancements of Industry 4.0, virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) have been used in
   many industries to visualize and interact with digital twins in
   real-time. These technologies have also been used with building
   information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS)
   throughout the life cycle of construction projects. Moreover, the
   integration of BIM and GIS has been proven to improve collaboration
   among stakeholders by allowing them to visualize information seamlessly
   between buildings and their surroundings. Following the COVID-19
   pandemic, many undergraduate and graduate courses were moved online,
   which posed many challenges on instructors to deliver lectures in
   accessible and informative ways. Furthermore, many courses and curricula
   have been originally online and have not yet benefited from the full
   potential of MR in virtual classrooms. Therefore, the aim of this
   research is to evaluate how MR applications of integrated BIM-GIS can
   improve the online learning experience of construction management
   students. An experimental study was conducted with students to evaluate
   the effect of using AR on handheld devices and MR on head-mounted

Title = {Environmental performance assessment of hardboard manufacture},

Year = {2009},

Abstract = {The forest-based and related industries comprise one of the most
   important industry sectors in the European Union, representing some 10\%
   of the EU's manufacturing industries. Their activities are based on
   renewable raw material resources and efficient recycling. The
   forest-based industries can be broken down into the following sectors:
   forestry, woodworking, pulp and paper manufacturing, paper and board
   converting and printing and furniture. The woodworking sector includes
   many sub-sectors; one of the most important is that of wood panels
   accounting for 9\% of total industry production. Wood panels are used as
   intermediate products in a wide variety of applications in the furniture
   and building industries. There are different kinds of panels:
   particleboard, fibreboard, veneer, plywood and blockboard. The main goal
   of this study was to assess the environmental impacts during the life
   cycle of wet-process fibreboard (hardboard) manufacturing to identify
   the processes with the largest environmental impacts.
   The study covers the life cycle of hardboard production from a
   cradle-to-gate perspective. A hardboard plant was analysed in detail,
   dividing the process chain into three subsystems: wood preparation,
   board forming and board finishing. Ancillary activities such as
   chemicals, wood chips, thermal energy and electricity production and
   transport were included within the system boundaries. Inventory data
   came from interviews and surveys (on-site measurements). When necessary,
   the data were complemented with bibliographic resources. The life cycle
   assessment procedure followed the ISO14040 series. The life cycle
   inventory (LCI) and impact assessment database for this study were
   constructed using SimaPro Version 7.0 software.
   Abiotic depletion (AD), global warming (GW), ozone layer depletion
   (OLD), human toxicity (HT), ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidant formation
   (PO), acidification (AC) and eutrophication (EP) were the impact
   categories analysed in this study. The wood preparation subsystem
   contributed more than 50\% to all impact categories, followed by board
   forming and board finishing, which is mainly due to chemicals
   consumption in the wood preparation subsystem. In addition, thermal
   energy requirements (for all subsystems) were fulfilled by on-site wood
   waste burning and, accordingly, biomass energy converters were
   considered. Several processes were identified as hot spots in this
   study: phenol-formaldehyde resin production (with large contribution to
   HT, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity and PO), electricity production
   (main contributor to marine aquatic ecotoxicity), wood chips production
   (AD and OLD) and finally, biomass burning for heat production
   (identified as the largest contributor to AC and EP due to NO (X)
   emissions). In addition, uncontrolled formaldehyde emissions from
   manufacturing processes at the plant such as fibre drying should be
   controlled due to relevant contributions to terrestrial ecotoxicity and
   PO. A sensitivity analysis of electricity profile generation (strong
   geographic dependence) was carried out and several European profiles
   were analysed.
   Novel binding agents for the wood panel industry as a substitute for the
   currently used formaldehyde-based binders have been extensively
   investigated. Reductions of toxic emissions during drying, mat forming
   and binder production are desirable. The improved method would
   considerably reduce the contributions to all impact categories.
   The results obtained in this work allow forecasting the importance of
   the wood preparation subsystem for the environmental burdens associated
   with hardboard manufacture. Special attention was paid to the inventory
   analysis stage for each subsystem. It is possible to improve the
   environmental performance of the hardboard manufacturing process if some
   alternatives are implemented regarding the use of chemicals, electricity
   profile and emission sources in the production processes located inside
   the plant.
   This study provides useful information for forest-based industries
   related to panel manufacture with the aim of increasing their
   sustainability. Our research continues to assess the use phase and final
   disposal of panels to complete the life cycle assessment. Future work
   will focus on analysing the environmental aspects associated with
   plywood, another type of commonly used wood panel.},

Abstract = {Green roofs are considered to be one of the optimal tools for saving
   energy and protecting the environment in developed countries. In this
   paper, an analysis of the possible application of green roofs on
   existing residential buildings with flat roofs is presented. In the
   economic analysis, models of existing buildings in Belgrade, with two
   different types of green roofs, are studied. A key indicator of
   investment profitability in this investigation is the net present value
   (NPV) of the green roof project. Besides the private economic impact,
   other aspects of green roof applications, significant for sustainable
   development, have been highlighted. The values of the reductions in the
   annual energy needed for heating and cooling are compared for different
   scenarios. A maximum energy saving of 22\% in the heating season is
   determined in the building energy simulation program for the model with
   an intensive green roof. Life cycle profit analysis was based on the
   probabilistic approach. The corresponding variance-based sensitivity
   analysis determined the impact of various parameters on the final
   result. In all models, the first order sensitivity index, which measures
   the impact of the number of residential units on the NPV, ranges from
   12.2\% to 63.6\%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the benefit of
   property value increase has the highest influence on the calculated NPV
   in scenarios that account for this benefit. The obtained results in
   those scenarios indicate that the most probable NPV at the end of the
   life cycle is EUR 43/m(2) and EUR 82/m(2) for extensive and intensive
   green roofs, respectively.},

Title = {Extending BIM interoperability to preconstruction operations using
   geospatial analyses and semantic web services},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, building information modeling (BIM) has been used
   through the entire project life cycle to facilitate effective project
   collaboration and integration of data to support project activities.
   Despite the successful applications of BIM in the design and
   construction stages, the use of BIM for preconstruction planning has not
   gained wide acceptance as in other project phases. The integration of
   BIM and geospatial analyses can offer substantial benefits to manage the
   planning process during the design and preconstruction stages. However,
   this integration suffers from a lack of interoperability across the
   geospatial and BIM domains. Semantic web technology is used in this
   study to convey meaning, which is interpretable by both construction
   project participants as well as BIM and geographic information systems
   (GIS) applications processing the transferred data. To achieve this, we
   first translate building's elements and GIS data into a semantic web
   data format Then we use a set of standardized ontologies for
   construction operations to integrate and query the heterogeneous spatial
   and temporal data. Finally, we use a query language to access and
   acquire the data in semantic web format. Through two scenario examples,
   the potential usefulness of the proposed methodology is validated.

Abstract = {An analysis of the economic and environmental trends in the last decade
   shows how the energy demand has increased more rapidly than the GDP
   growth and the current scenario in 2015 foresees rates substantially

   more than 90\% of the total, the implementation of thorough energy
   retrofit and the use of bio-ecological materials is necessary to achieve
   the objectives set by the European Commission by 2020. Paper deals with
   the issue of evaluating sustainable retrofit of existing cities by
   experimenting a methodological process that has the specific goal of
   implementing ``Sustainable Neighborhoods{''} or ``Energy Urban

Abstract = {The emergence of Digital Twin (DT) technology presents unique
   opportunities for society by facilitating real-time data transfer from
   the physical environment to its digital counterpart. Although progress
   has been made in various industry sectors such as aerospace, the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) sector
   still requires further advancements, like the adoption of these
   technologies over traditional approaches. The use of these technologies
   should become standard practice rather than an advanced operation. This
   paper aims to address the existing gap by presenting a comprehensive
   framework that integrates technologies and concepts derived from
   purpose-driven case studies and research studies across different
   industries. The framework is designed to provide best practices for the
   AECO sector. Moreover, it aims to underscores the potential of DT for
   optimization through overseeing and digital management of the built
   environment across the entire life cycle of facilities, encompassing
   design, construction, operation, and maintenance. It is based on an
   extensive literature review and presents a holistic approach to
   outlining the roles of Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other key
   enablers within the DT environment. These digital tools facilitating the

Abstract = {Construction industry has become much more complex due to the large

   order to share this information between architect, contractor,
   construction manager, etc., there are need to develop a common model
   that can document and store this information in single platform. BIM
   represents a series of parametric objects that composed together to form
   a building model which carries all information includes their physical
   and functional characteristics and project life cycle information. Since
   BIM represent the detailed geometrical and semantic information of the
   building, the application of GIS is needed to manage the construction
   project's information resources. GIS can use information from many
   different sources, in many different formats and can link data sets
   together by common locational data such as coordinate or postal zip
   code. Besides, GIS can use combinations of data sets to build and
   analyze integrated information and also can convert the existing digital
   information into a form that meets the user's need. From this point of
   view, GIS can complement BIM function in order to develop a systematic
   platform for construction purpose. Finding of this study, there are some
   drawbacks in this technique especially in the construction application
   in term of data sharing, data integration and data management.
   Furthermore, the integration of GIS in BIM is studied and potential
   techniques are shown to overcome the drawbacks of the construction
   application.},

   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the
   digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building
   information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall
   life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration
   with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical
   analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share
   several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to
   address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management,
   where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a
   systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to
   retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results
   found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and
   suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and
   practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address
   ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the
   BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA
   approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration
   topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for
   BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is
   the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to
   perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems
   for asset management.},

   methodologies: A case study of energy retrofits in the Barcelona

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {This study proposes a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS) methodology to develop complex
   LCA inventories for multiple applications. The study focusses on the
   environmental implications of buildings retrofits, especially in the
   European context, where the building sector is one of the largest energy
   consumers. In this context, a new and holistic perspective is needed
   that expands from the building scale to the urban scale.
   The combination of LCA and GIS methods includes the development of an
   urban characterization model based on bottom-up methodologies. The
   environmental implications associated with increasing the thermal
   insulation of existing buildings to the current standard are determined
   based on LCA methods. In this step, common construction systems for
   building retrofits are used, and insulation materials are compared.
   Then, absolute and relative extrapolations are performed considering
   different urban morphologies.
   The results confirm the importance of the energy retrofitting of
   residential buildings in large functional urban areas such as the
   Barcelona metropolitan area, which is examined as a case study. The LCA
   results indicate that the selection of proper construction systems and
   thermal insulation materials is important to the environmental
   performance of building retrofits, and these selections can lead to CO2
   emission differences of up 16\% in the region. The relative
   extrapolation results indicate significant environmental differences
   between urban morphologies. The LCA results show the potential strategic
   impacts of the inclusion of LCA methods in retrofit policies at the
   urban scale.},

Abstract = {In this interactive lively lunch discussion, participants explored
   issues around how the traditional subject liaison role is evolving.
   Users increasingly require functional information support (e.g., for
   geographic information system (GIS) or data mining) rather than simply
   domain-specific. At the same time, reports from the Association of
   Research Libraries (ARL) Pilot Library Liaison Institute and others have
   noted self-conscious trends toward developing liaison roles that engage
   and support the full research life cycle, as opposed to traditional
   service models focused on building and promoting library collections as
   more or less fixed products. Hosts Darby Orcutt, Mira Waller, and Scott
   Warren outlined some the major theme surrounding the future of these new
   roles and with participants explored questions that include: What does
   it mean to be a collections librarian in this new world? What new skills
   do we need to develop? What old skills should we not lose? How do we
   adapt both our institutions and our individual staff without sacrificing
   our (or their) very identities?},

Abstract = {Quemoy University has taken over Cemetery 2 region after it was released
   by the military. It became the school's other campus, with plans to
   change the site from an unused military camp to a sustainable campus.
   The finished project will include a carbon inventory of the buildings
   and landscape of the original camp, and overall campus planning and
   design. Incorporating the concept of applying GIS, the planning and
   survey data mentioned above will be used as the basis for the future
   research design and implementation. Aerial maps will be combined with
   cadastral and topographic maps to establish a basic evaluation resource
   map: a site plan map, data point map, building carbon footprint map, and
   route carbon footprint map. The main carbon hotspot of each building's
   life cycle total carbon footprint is 549,293.14 kgCO(2)e/30 yr. Through
   putting solar panel systems on the buildings' rooftops and the 30 year
   landscape carbon inventory principle of no disturbance as the carbon
   offset, the unused military campus will become a zero-carbon campus. The
   maps above will act as carbon diagnostics for future campus operation
   carbon footprint analysis and provide the current situation of the
   campus's environmental sustainability and future visual scenario
   simulations, helping decision makers to build a sustainable campus
   environment strategy.},

Title = {Utilizing intelligent technologies in construction and demolition waste
   management: From a systematic review to an implementation framework},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 21},
Abstract = {The rapid increase in global urbanization, along with the growth of the
   construction industry, highlights the urgent need for effective
   management of construction and demolition (C\&D) waste. Intelligent
   technologies offer a viable solution to this critical challenge.
   However, there remains a significant challenge in integrating these
   technologies into a cohesive framework. This study conducts a
   quantitative analysis of 214 papers from 2000 to 2023, highlighting the
   extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and building information
   modeling (BIM), along with geographic information systems (GIS) and big
   data (BD). A further qualitative analysis of 73 selected papers
   investigates the use of seven different intelligent technologies in the
   context of C\&D waste management (CDWM). To overcome current limitations
   in knowledge, future research should concentrate on (1) the
   comprehensive integration of technology, (2) inclusive studies
   throughout all lifecycle phases of CDWM, and (3) the continued
   examination of new technologies, such as blockchain. Based on these
   insights, this study suggests a strategic framework for the effective
   implementation of intelligent technologies in CDWM. This framework aims
   to assist professionals in merging various technologies, undertaking
   lifecycle-wide research, and narrowing the divide between existing and
   new technologies. It also lays a solid foundation for future academic
   work to examine specific intelligent technologies, conduct comparative
   studies, and refine strategic decisions. Regular updates on
   technological developments are essential for stakeholders to
   consistently enhance CDWM standards.},

Abstract = {The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) is gaining momentum in digital built Asset
   Management (AM), and has the potential to improve information management
   operations and provide advantages in process control and delivery of
   quality AM services, along with underlying data management benefits
   through entire life cycle of an asset. Work has been carried out
   relating GeoBIM/AM to buildings as well as infrastructure assets, where
   the potential financial savings are extensive. While information form
   BIM maybe be sufficient for building-AM; for infrastructure AM a
   combination of GIS and BIM is required. Scientific literature relating
   to this topic has been growing in recent years and has now reached a
   point where a systematic analysis of current and potential uses of
   GeoBIM in AM for Infrastructure is possible. Three specific areas form
   part of the analysis - a review of BIM and Infrastructure AM and GIS and
   Infrastructure AM leads to a better understanding of current practice.
   Combining the two, a review of GeoBIM and Infrastructure AM allows the
   benefits of, and issues relating to, GeoBIM to be clearly identified,
   both at technical and operational levels. A set of 54 journal articles
   was selected for in-depth contents analysis according to the AM function
   addressed and the managed asset class. The analysis enabled the
   identification of three categories of issues and opportunities: data
   management, interoperability and integration and AM process and service
   management. The identified knowledge gaps, in turn, underpin problem
   definition for the next phases of research into GeoBIM for
   infrastructure AM.},

Title = {Dynamic Assessment of Construction Materials in Urban Building Stocks: A
   Critical Review},

Volume = {53},
Number = {17},
Pages = {9992-10006},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {There is a lack of understanding on the different types of dynamics of
   building stocks, in real life and in models. Moreover, there is now a
   particular interest in the embodied impacts of construction materials,
   since with the increasing efficiency of buildings operation, embodied
   impacts gain more importance in the overall building life cycle. This
   critical review wants to advance the understanding of the type of
   dynamics, methods, and tools used. The well-known IPAT equation is
   adapted for building stocks and three dynamics are defined: spatial,
   evolutionary temporal, and spatial-cohort dynamic. A framework is
   defined that can help researchers choose a method, tool, and dynamics of
   input parameters depending on their research goal, case study, and data.
   Moreover, generally valid conclusions are drawn, including MFA is useful
   to model spatially dynamic material flows; GIS is needed to include
   spatial dynamics. Retrofit, compared to construction and demolition, is
   understudied and usually analyzed through top-down methods. Material
   intensity and emission intensity are rarely modeled in a dynamic way.
   Overall, scholars seem to perform increasingly data intensive and
   complex studies tailored to a specific case study. However, there are
   big differences in the quality depending on the dynamic of input
   parameters.},

Title = {Big data GIS analysis for novel approaches in building stock modelling},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},

Volume = {208},
Pages = {277-290},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Building heat demand is responsible for a significant share of the total
   global final energy consumption. Building stock models with a high
   spatio-temporal resolution are a powerful tool to investigate the
   effects of new building policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency,
   the introduction of new heating technologies or the integration of
   buildings within an energy system based on renewable energy sources.
   Therefore, building stock models have to be able to model the
   improvements and variation of used materials in buildings. In this
   paper, we propose a method based on generalized large-scale geographic
   information system (GIS) to model building heat demand of large regions
   with a high temporal resolution. In contrast to existing building stock
   models, our approach allows to derive the envelope of all buildings from
   digital elevation models and to model location dependent effects such as
   shadowing due to the topography and climate conditions. We integrate
   spatio-temporal climate data for temperature and solar radiation to
   model climate effects of complex terrain. The model is validated against
   a database containing the measured energy demand of 1845 buildings of
   the city of St. Gallen, Switzerland and 120 buildings of the Alpine
   village of Zernez, Switzerland. The proposed model is able to assess and
   investigate large regions by using spatial data describing natural and
   anthropogenic land features. The validation resulted in an average
   goodness of fit (R-2) of 0.6.},

Title = {A political-industrial ecology of water supply infrastructure for Los
   Angeles},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {38-50},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper develops a political-industrial ecology approach to explore
   the urban water metabolism of Los Angeles, which sprawls for thousands
   of miles across the American West. Conventional approaches to quantify
   urban carbon footprints rely on global, national, or regional averages
   and focus narrowly on improving the efficiency of flows of resources
   moving into and out of the city. These approaches tend to ``black
   box{''} the methodologies that guide the carbon emissions calculus and
   the social, political, ecological, and economic processes that
   perpetually reshape nature-society metabolisms. To more fully delineate
   the water supply metabolism of Los Angeles, this paper combines theory
   and method from urban political ecology and industrial ecology.
   Specifically, we infuse spatiality into the traditional life-cycle
   assessment (LCA) approach by coupling it with GIS. By illustrating how
   decisions about system boundaries, emissions factors, and other building
   blocks fundamentally shape the end result, this intervention at once
   destabilizes and advances the LCA enterprise. Then, using interviews and
   historical analysis, we provide a critical analysis of how LA's various
   water supply infrastructures came to be and illustrate how a sustainable
   transition based on a narrow carbon calculus is problematized by
   historical circumstances and strategic (and often conflicting) new
   paradigms to secure water resources. The political-industrial ecology
   approach offers valuable insights into the spatiality of material
   metabolisms and the socio-political processes (re)shaping the relations
   between nature and society. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Explorative life-cycle assessment of renovating existing urban
   housingstocks},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban building-stocks are responsible for a significant share of
   resource and energy use. To quantify the potential for reducing energy
   and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly
   used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental
   impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are
   often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often
   used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as
   a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future
   state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of
   the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual
   scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the
   multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses
   an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic
   uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until
   2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on
   either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further
   divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual
   share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings
   of up to 23\% and a corresponding 31\% reduction in greenhouse-gas
   emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand
   are offset by up to 65\% by accounting for material use due to
   construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour
   construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the
   major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point
   indicators used.},

   and bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {41-52},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) and geographical information
   systems (GIS) provide digital representation of architectural and
   environmental entities. BIM focuses on micro-level representation of
   buildings themselves, and GIS provide macro-level representation of the
   external environments of buildings. Moreover, their combination can
   establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data
   integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the
   architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the
   digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS
   integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the
   status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies
   for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects,
   building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of
   BIM-GIS integration, namely, ``BIM leads and GIS supports{''}, ``GIS
   leads and BIM supports{''}, and ``BIM and GIS are equally involved{''},
   are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two
   technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for
   the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we
   underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms
   should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process
   of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for
   building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve
   its systematic integration and application to the urban built
   environment. This review can serve as a roadmap for researchers who
   focus on studies of BIM-GIS integration in the sustainable built
   environment.},

Title = {Using BIM to improve building energy efficiency-A scientometric and
   systematic review},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {250},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO)
   sector is responsible for a great proportion of the global energy
   consumption and associated environmental impacts. On this front, and
   from a sustainability improvement perspective, the use of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) capabilities could represent an opportunity
   to improve these impacts in all steps of a building's life. The main
   purpose of the current paper is to identify the areas in which BIM
   technology can or already is playing a role in improving building
   efficiency, helping AECO sector stakeholders in reducing environmental
   impacts. In the current paper, the impact of using BIM to enhance the
   building energy efficiency is explored through a scientometric analysis
   and a systematic literature review. There is a high interest among the
   scientific community in these fields, given the recent rise in
   publications and citation numbers. Moreover, there is a lack of
   interoperability between BIM and energy analysis tools, a high potential
   for integrating BIM with other technologies, such as thermography,
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and monitoring, and a very positive
   impact from the use of BIM in the optimisation of construction solutions
   which allow energy savings in the AECO sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {With the digitalization of construction the planning and implementation
   process is undergoing a fundamental methodological transformation. The
   employment of BIM (Building Information Modelling) permits end-to-end
   planning. By means of sample projects it is explained how - above all in
   the service phases conceptual, preliminary and detailed design -
   intelligent parameterized building models can be set up in bridge and
   civil engineering. The additional combination with alignment and GIS
   data in these phases furnishes a flexible and robust basis upon which to
   create a holistic evaluation of planning concepts. With the application
   of a parameterized, object-oriented complete model it is possible to
   realize an integral process chain across the whole planning and
   implementation period as well as across the entire life cycle. The 3D
   model contains, apart from the individual structural components,
   project-specific attributes and information. Coupling the digital model
   to resource, cost and time scheduling and simulating the construction
   sequence yield complex 4D and 5D bridge models.},

Abstract = {Roads are networks that connect social infrastructure and accommodate
   the delivery of emergency services. Because of the importance of roads,
   they should be safe and kept in good condition. To perform effective
   road management, the use of spatial and temporal information is
   necessary. Maintenance management is an essential operation that should
   be carried out effectively for maintaining, repairing, and
   rehabilitating roads. It is necessary to accumulate information produced
   during the entire life cycle of a road in order to analyze problems and
   find solutions within a temporal sequence and to maintain roads
   strategically and effectively. In this paper, four-dimensional
   information is defined as the combination of three-dimensional spatial
   information and temporal information. Four-dimensional information is
   required for storing the historical information of road condition. This
   paper proposes a four-dimensional information management system to
   collect, accumulate, share, and utilize four-dimensional information.
   The system consists of a spatial data infrastructure, road data models,
   a model library, a common system interface, common functions, a road
   database, and a road application system. The road application system
   provides functions for simulation, progress management, and the
   representation of four-dimensional information. The system is
   demonstrated using actual data on road maintenance. It is verified that
   the system has the capability to be applied in practice. (C) 2013

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the current framework of energy transition, renewable energy
   production has gained a renewed relevance. A set of 75 papers was
   selected from the existing literature and critically analyzed to
   understand the main inputs and tools used to calculate solar energy and
   derive theoretical photovoltaic production based on geographic
   information systems (GISs). A heterogeneous scenario for solar energy
   estimation emerged from the analysis, with a prevalence of 2.5D
   tools-mainly ArcGIS and QGIS-whose calculation is refined chiefly by
   inputting weather data from databases. On the other hand, despite some
   minor changes, the formula for calculating the photovoltaic potential is
   widely acknowledged and includes solar energy, exploitable surface,
   performance ratio, and panel efficiency. While sectorial
   studies-targeting a specific component of the calculation-are sound, the
   comprehensive ones are generally problematic due to excessive
   simplification of some parts. Moreover, validation is often lacking or,
   when present, only partial. The research on the topic is in constant
   evolution, increasingly moving towards purely 3D models and refining the
   estimation to include the time component-both in terms of life cycle and
   variations between days and seasons.},

Title = {A Spatially-Explicit Economic and Financial Assessment of Closed-Loop
   Ground-Source Geothermal Heat Pumps: A Case Study for the Residential
   Buildings of Valle d'Aosta Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) take advantage of the high thermal
   inertia of the ground to achieve a higher energy efficiency compared to
   Air Source Heat Pumps. GSHPs, therefore, have the potential to reduce
   heating, cooling, and domestic hot water costs, however the high
   installation cost of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) limits the growth
   of such installations. Nevertheless, GSHPs can be profitable under
   certain conditions (climate, expensive fuels, subsidies, etc.), which
   can be identified using geo-referenced data and Geographical Information
   Systems (GIS). The proposed work investigates the economic and financial
   ability of GSHPs to cover the heat demand of the residential building
   stock of the Italian region Valle d'Aosta. To identify the opportunities
   offered by GSHPs in the Valle d'Aosta region, more than 40,000
   residential buildings were analyzed using a GIS-based method. The return
   on the investment was then assessed based on the occurrence of two
   conditions-the Italian subsidies of the ``Conto Termico `` and the
   installation of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems-which contribute to
   the reduction of the initial and operation costs, respectively. The
   life-cycle costs of the four resulting combinations were compared with
   conventional systems composed of an oil/gas boiler and an air-source
   chiller. One of the main findings of this study is that subsidies exert
   a key role in the financial feasibility of GSHPs, especially for
   replacing gas boilers, whereas the presence of a PV system has a minor
   influence on the financial analysis carried out.},

Title = {Integrated Framework of BIM and GIS Applications to Support Building
   Lifecycle: A Move toward nD Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) to support
   various tasks of building lifecycle management (BLM) has been reported
   in a range of studies. However, during its lifetime, a building is an
   important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must
   not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its
   participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what
   way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its
   surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been
   reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building
   lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a
   building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however
   potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet
   been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of
   application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM
   processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings,
   site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby
   facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical
   framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM
   and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all
   stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable
   decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management
   of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established
   that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated
   solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective. (c) 2021 American

   evaluating the rooftop photovoltaic potential of old residential
   buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Energy-saving reconstruction of old residential buildings is a vital way
   to achieve sustainable development, but the potential of rooftop
   photovoltaic (PV) energy-saving in old residential buildings has not
   been studied. This study established a basic framework for the
   estimation of rooftop PV technical, economic and environmental potential
   in the old residential buildings of Nanjing City, and provide the
   prediction results for the development of rooftop PV development plan in
   Nanjing. We estimated the available area, maximum electricity
   generation, environmental and economic benefits of rooftop PV in five
   districts of Nanjing by using building roof profile data, calculation
   method of maximum solar radiation at optimal tilt angle and GIS method.
   We find that the electricity generation potential of installing rooftop
   PV in the old residential buildings in the study area would meet about
   17.7-20\% of the residential electricity demand under three scenarios of
   the PV performance ratios (PR). Additionally, the carbon reduction
   potential of the life cycle rooftop PV reaches 13912874.12t (PR = 0.85),
   13094469.76t (PR = 0.8), and 12276065.4t (PR = 0.75), respectively; and
   the result of economic potential shows that the life cycle of rooftop PV
   cannot generate economic benefits with an NPV value less than 0. The
   feasibility analysis framework provided in this paper can be applied to
   the assessment of rooftop PV potential in other cities in China, and
   provide valuable advice for the rational planning of rooftop PV.},

Title = {Urban mining potential to reduce primary material use and carbon
   emissions in the Dutch residential building sector},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {180},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Urban mining is regarded as an important strategy to replace primary raw
   materials in the building sector. This study presents a bottom-up
   dynamic building stock model to explore the potential of urban mining to
   reduce primary material consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   in the residential building sector of the Netherlands. The model builds
   upon geo-referenced individual buildings, making it possible to analyze
   the spatiotemporal pattern of material supply from demolition and
   material demand for construction and renovation. The main results can be
   summarized as three points. (1) Urban mining cannot meet future material
   demand due to the new construction caused by population increase and its
   limited ability to supply the required kinds and amounts of materials.
   Therefore, large amounts of primary materials still have to be consumed
   in the future. (2) The generation of demolition wastes and the
   requirement for materials will be mainly concentrated in the big cities
   (e.g. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague). (3) The GHG emission
   reduction potential of urban mining is very small and is not as large as
   the transition to a greener electricity mix. Recycling together with a
   greener electricity mix would reduce annual GHG emissions by about 40\%
   in 2050 compared to 2020. This study provides a tool to link future
   material inflows and outflows in space and time. It further helps to
   assess the performance of strategies aimed at closing the material loops
   and reducing GHG emissions in the building sector.},

Title = {Balancing construction and operational carbon emissions: Evaluating
   neighbourhood renovation strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {94},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Compliance with the global decarbonisation commitments set out in
   Horizon 2050 undoubtedly involves optimising the conditions of the
   housing stock. In this respect, the massive energy renovation of
   obsolete housing blocks in southern EU countries holds the key for the
   achievement of such compliance. This research strives to demonstrate the
   suitability of intervention strategies at district scale. For this
   purpose, an innovative methodology that combines open data, Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS), Urban Energy Modelling (UBEM), and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is proposed and tested in a case study, whilst
   considering several renovation and new-building hypotheses. As an
   innovative approach, this study concurrently analyses greenhouse gas
   emissions arising from both use-related energy consumption (operational
   carbon footprint) and the construction process (embodied carbon
   footprint). This dual perspective provides added value to the results
   obtained, since it offers a more comprehensive representation of
   reality. Based on the results from the LCA and UBEM models, this study
   unveils the entire impact of residential energy use combined with either
   the carbon footprint of energy renovation or that of new buildings. The
   case study analysis reveals that total emissions, encompassing both
   embodied and operational aspects, are lower for retrofitting existing
   buildings when compared to new construction, up to Horizon 2050.
   Remarkably, this preference for renovation persists even as far as 2100.
   The study underscores the critical importance of upgrading the existing
   residential stock in order to achieve the ambitious goal of net-zero
   greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.},

Abstract = {Materials are continuously accumulating in the human-built environment
   since massive amounts of materials are required for building,
   developing, and maintaining cities. At the end of their life cycles,
   these materials are considered valuable sources of secondary materials.
   The increasing construction and demolition waste released from aging
   stock each year make up the heaviest, most voluminous waste outflow,
   presenting challenges and opportunities. These material stocks should be
   utilized and exploited since the reuse and recycling of construction
   materials would positively impact the natural environment and resource
   efficiency, leading to sustainable cities within a grander scheme of a
   circular economy. The exploitation of material stock is known as urban
   mining. In order to make these materials accessible for future mining,
   material quantities need to be estimated and extrapolated to regional
   levels. This demanding task requires a vast knowledge of the existing
   building stock, which can only be obtained through labor-intensive,
   time-consuming methodologies or new technologies, such as building
   information modeling (BIM), geographic information systems (GISs),
   artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. This review paper
   gives a general overview of the literature body and tracks the evolution

Title = {A GIS based method to calculate regionalized land use characterization
   factors for life cycle impact assessment using LANCA®},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Purpose Land is used and modified in its natural function for the
   cultivation of food and energy crops, for infrastructure and other
   production purposes. Despite their global significance, land use impacts
   are still rarely addressed, although methods for integrating land use
   into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This
   paper describes the development and calculation of regionalized
   characterization factors based on the LANCA (R) (Land Use Indicator
   Value Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment) method to be integrated into
   LCA using a geo information system (GIS). Methods With the publication
   of the LANCA (R) characterization factors (Bos et al. 2016), land use
   impacts can be assessed at the country level. However, soil parameters
   as well as climatic conditions change on a small scale and are very
   site-specific. Therefore, there is a need for regionalized
   characterization factors. After a literature review, we describe the
   development of the five LANCA (R) indicators. Afterwards we present the
   conceptual framework for the calculation of GIS-based characterization
   factors and apply this framework to two examples, the indicators of
   mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration. Finally, we apply
   the characterization factors in a case study. Results, application and
   discussion The region-specific characterization factors are calculated
   in a GIS environment yielding a map with values for mechanical
   filtration and physicochemical filtration per grid cell for various land
   use types. A case study shows that land use impacts fluctuate due to
   site-specific conditions such as pedological, topographical and climatic
   conditions. It can be shown that our calculation of regionalized
   characterization factors in global maps is feasible and facilitates an
   area's potential for causing lower environmental impacts for a certain
   land use compared to other areas. Remaining challenges are related to
   input data quality, the comprehensibility of the results to
   practitioners that are not land use experts and the technical
   restrictions of LCA database and software providers. Conclusions Through
   the presented regionalization of the LANCA (R) framework, a necessary
   prerequisite to method advancement is met as also region-specific
   characterization factors can now be calculated. In comparison to the
   published country-specific characterization factors in Bos et al.
   (2016), the developed regional GIS-based characterization factors are
   far more advantageous especially for large countries. Nevertheless, it
   has to be noted that an LCA including the evaluation of land use does
   not replace methods and tools like environmental impact assessment. When
   deciding on a preferable location for a specific land use nature
   conservation, geographical, geological and building law aspects must
   also be taken into account.},

Title = {Carbon reduction benefits of photovoltaic-green roofs and their climate
   change mitigation potential: A case study of Xiamen city},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {114},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The Photovoltaic-Green Roof (PV-GR) system, which integrates rooftop
   photovoltaics and green roofing, has significant potential for
   sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation. However,
   the specific effects of PV-GR are not yet clear. This paper employs
   methodologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
   Denitrification-Decomposition(DNDC) Model, and solar simulation.
   Combined with ecological balance calculations, these methods assess
   PV-GR's carbon reduction benefits and its potential to mitigate climate
   change. Using Xiamen City as a case study, research shows that Xiamen
   has about 54 km2 of rooftops suitable for PV-GR. Annually, PV-GR can
   produce about 5.931x103 tons of biomass and generate 7,427 GWh of
   electricity, meeting about 22.13 \% of Xiamen's annual electricity
   demand. The annual carbon reduction from Xiamen's PVGR is estimated at
   about 5.131x106 t CO2-eq, offsetting around 29.28 \% of the city's
   annual carbon emissions. Over a 30-year lifecycle, PV-GR's carbon
   emissions and reduction benefits amount to 2.274x107 t CO2-eq and
   1.539x108 t CO2-eq, respectively. The ecological footprint of deploying
   PV-GR in Xiamen is 6.709x104 Gha, while the biocapacity reaches
   4.542x105 Gha. The global ecological balance stands at 3.872x105 Gha,
   suggesting that PV-GR can significantly contribute to mitigating climate
   change.},

Abstract = {In order to manage analysis and project processes at a territorial,
   urban and architectural scale, linking information to metric data is an
   increasingly important topic.
   At a geographic and cartographic stage, the function of storing,
   managing and viewing data and information is performed by GIS
   (Geographic Information Systems), where vector features as points,
   lines, polygons are gathered in layers connected to an attribute table.
   In a similar way, when scale factor increases, for buildings and other
   engineering works there is a growing necessity to preserve data or
   attributes together with the features where they belong. For this
   purpose, a major role is played by BIM (Building Information Modeling),
   a modelling process in which the parts of a building are hierarchically
   organized and every feature is connected to an information table
   containing all data useful for the ongoing working process or for
   managing the life cycle of the modelled building or infrastructure.
   While the two systems are similar in concept, at the moment they suffer
   lack of mutual communication, especially in conveying informations from
   a platform to another.
   Studying relationships and possible connections between different data
   storage environments like GIS and BIM is one of the research topics of
   DATA - Developing Abandoned Transurban Areas, a research project now in
   progress at University of Padova, involving Departments of Civil,
   Architectural and Environmental Engineering and Industrial Engineering.
   The main goal of the project is to design pilot regeneration scenarios
   for wasted or underused places, focusing on a part of the western
   peri-urban area of Padova marked by the overlapping of partially
   abandoned industrial or commercial buildings, transport infrastructures
   like a ring road and a railway, residential fabric and green or
   agricultural land.
   Among DATA key features there is a multi-scale approach: in a framework
   where urban peripheries are considered a relation system between a city
   and the surrounding territory, the project aims to combine the methods
   of urban and territorial analysis with a design concept in which
   industrial landmarks or empty spaces become the core of possible urban
   transformations.
   Therefore, starting from data mining and management related to the areas
   of interest, procedures for GIS to BIM data transfer are surveyed and
   implemented; then, the buildings, facilities and building complex
   involved in scenarios design will be modelled in detail, and relevant
   building-scale information will be added.
   At the moment, within the project, a pipeline to convert a GIS map of
   the buildings in our area of interest into a BIM 3D model provided with
   all the information of the GIS layer has been developed. Then, when the
   BIM model is modified, its updated attributes can be taken back to the
   GIS level.
   The aim of this paper is to describe the workflow for GIS-BIM
   interoperability in DATA project, results achieved at the moment and
   future goals and applications.},

Abstract = {The building sector plays a key role in energy transition and carbon
   reduction while capturing the dynamic characteristics (e.g. materials,

   Netherlands by 2050. Results show that space heating demand decreases by
   about 2/3 by 2050, while the energy for hot water increases to 92\% of
   space heating demand. 80\% of public grid electricity for appliances and
   lighting can be potentially substituted if rooftop photovoltaic (PV)
   systems are installed on 50\% of renovated buildings and all the new
   buildings. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of operational energy are
   reduced by approximately 60-90\%, depending on the electricity mix.
   Annual GHG emissions from material production are not as important as
   those related to operational energy. Insulation materials account for a
   large proportion of the carbon footprint of material production. The
   model has a high spatial and temporal resolution and can be linked with
   local energy source availability (e.g. buildings or neighborhoods) to
   provide more accurate support for policymaking.},

Abstract = {An impediment to effective Circular Economy (CE) implementation in
   residential buildings is the lack of standardized building data to
   represent a building's life cycle, from material sourcing to end-of-use
   apparatus. This paper presents an overarching methodological approach
   for creating a circular web application named Data Homebase (DHB). DHB
   integrates housing data into Housing Passports (HPs), visualizing
   calculations of estimated energy use, carbon emissions, and
   affordability building indexes. Using data-driven narratives, DHB
   outlines a building's degree of circularity and potential for improved
   environmental outcomes via circular strategies. The passport system and
   data-based approach provide a once-missing portal entry for housing
   stakeholders seeking actionable circularity measurements. This research
   contributes to the long-term elucidation of key decision-making
   processes for homebuilding within a comprehensive tool to achieve a
   far-reaching CE.},

Title = {Assessment of sheep wool waste as new resource for green building

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Within the context of circular economy framework and green deal
   statement, the valorization of greasy wool into new resources for
   insulation building components, represents an important challenge. The
   sustainable and innovative alternative uses of this livestock waste
   could create new opportunity for the growing of sheep farming sector and
   reduce environmental issues. By using Geographic Information Systems
   tools a tailored methodology has been carried out to evaluate the
   availability and geographical distribution of sheared sheep wool, with
   the aim of quantifying the correct scale required for a sustainable
   production of sheep wool insulation products. In detail, the
   hypothetical production of insualtion material based on wool waste, soft
   mats (100\% wool) and semi-rigid panels (80\% wool and 20\% polyester),
   has been evalueted, at regional level and it was obtained that by
   reusing the computed sheep wool, i.e., 9,839,700 kg/year, more than 1,5
   millions of soft mats or more than 11,5 millions of semi-rigid panels
   could be produced, which correspond, respectively, to more than 6.5
   million and more than 17 thousand of square meter. These results,
   obtained by the conversion of raw wool into new re-sources, represent
   the first step for developing a new wool valorization chain.},

Title = {Geographic Information System-assisted optimal design of renewable
   powered electric vehicle charging stations in high-density cities},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The crowded urban environment and busy traffic lead to heavy roadside
   pollutions in high-density cities, thereby causing health damages to
   city pedestrians. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered as a promising
   solution to such street-level air pollutions. Currently, in high-density
   cities, the number of public charging stations is limited, and they are
   far from enough to form a complete charging network with a high coverage
   ratio that can provide easy and convenient charging services for EV
   users. Concerns and worries on being unable to find a charging port when
   needed become a major hurdle to EV practical applications. Meanwhile,
   greener and cheaper renewable energy is recommended to replace fossil
   fuel-based grid energy that is commonly used in existing charging
   stations. Thus, this study proposes a novel Geographic Information
   System (GIS) assisted optimal design method for renewable powered EV
   charging stations in high-density cities. By selecting the optimal
   locations and optimal number of the renewable powered charging stations
   with the considerations of the existing charging stations and renewable
   potentials, the proposed method is able to minimize the life cycle cost
   of the charging stations while satisfying a user defined area coverage
   ratio. Using Hong Kong as an example, case studies have been conducted
   to verify the proposed design method. The design method can be used in
   practice to help high-density cities build their public charging
   networks with cost-effectiveness, which will promote EV practical
   applications and thus alleviate the roadside air pollutions in
   high-density cities.},

Title = {Case Study of Remodelling the As-Built Documentation of a Railway
   Construction into the BIM and GIS Environment},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a modern approach to managing
   the process of preparation, realization and operation of building
   objects including their documentation throughout their life cycle, based
   on database agenda platform. The aim of our research is to analyze and
   innovate existing engineering procedures with the aim: 1. to remodel the
   existing CAD documentation into BIM for the purpose of public
   procurement, 2. to provide guaranteed data to the IS of the Digital Map
   of Public Administration and 3. to provide data for the design of new
   railway structures or their reconstruction. The aim of the case study
   was to evaluate the effectiveness of remodelling the existing as-built
   documentation of a railway construction into a common BIM data
   environment (CDE), in which further subsequent construction agenda
   should be managed for the remaining period of its life cycle. Using the
   documentation for construction realization of the railway station
   Sumice, this 3D documentation was remodeled into the BIM data
   environment CDE and alternatively also into the 2D GIS environment. The
   BIM data standard developed by the State Fund for Transport
   Infrastructure was analyzed during the documentation reworking. An
   important parameter of the documentation rework was the use of a
   geodetic reference system fully compatible with the cadastral system in
   the Czech Republic. It turned out that the general data standard is only
   partially applicable for railway structures containing many special
   objects and many objects requiring individual classification. The
   remodelling of existing graphical data proved faster and more efficient
   in a GIS environment (layer oriented) compared to the need for 3D
   remodelling in a BIM CDE (object oriented). Experimental results have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of remodelling underground technical
   infrastructure objects, while the visible surface situation is often
   more effectively captured by current progressive bulk data acquisition
   technologies. In a CDE environment, existing as-built documentation data
   can be efficiently stored and administered and progressively, for the
   procurement and execution of construction, purposefully remodeled only
   to the extent required in BIM or converted into an exchangeable Digital
   Technical Map (DTM) format for public administration.},

Abstract = {Interoperability of information systems is partially resolved due to
   many standards such as networks protocols, XML derived languages and
   object oriented programming. Nevertheless, semantic heterogeneity limits
   collaborative works and interoperability. Despite ontology and other
   semantic technics, the binding of heterogeneous information systems
   requires new technics of managing and displaying information according
   to the semantic representation of each stakeholder of the collaboration.
   In this paper we addressed the problem of merging geographical
   information systems and building information model. The way to achieve
   this goal must solve several heterogeneity problems due to the data life
   cycle, the data temporality, the binding between 2D geo-referenced
   modelling and 3D geometric models or problem of scalability for
   real-time 3D display from remote server for managing a real environment
   of several million m2. To bridge this gap, we present a new architecture
   based on a semantic multi-representation of heterogeneous information.},

Abstract = {Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emission and its associated negative effects on the
   environment and quality of life present a significant challenge to
   scientists, environmental authorities, and politicians. Lowering the
   released CO2 emission is vital to preserve the natural environmental
   conditions and achieve sustainability in the long run. Recent literature
   has emphasized the importance of studying and analyzing CO2 emissions
   generated by the building construction sector. However, limited research
   considered the Spatio-temporal analysis and its relevance to the CO2
   emissions at an urban scale. This research aims to develop a Geographic
   Information System (GIS) based framework to assess CO2 emissions with
   urbanization over time for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE has
   witnessed a significant evolution in terms of urban development,
   demographic distribution, and lifestyle, in the last few decades. The
   developed framework offers a visualized CO2 assessment of both
   construction carbon and operational carbon to provide concerned
   authorities with better insights into the environmental effect of urban
   development. The framework will be implemented and validated on a case
   study of one of the Emirates in the UAE to study the expansion and
   carbon emission over a specific analysis period. In this research, Ajman
   city was chosen to implement the methodology. In the case of
   construction carbon, the results illustrated that residential buildings
   have the highest CO2 emissions factor with about 1,358 kg CO2/m(2)
   associated with building construction, while governmental buildings have
   the lowest CO2 emissions factor with about 445 kg CO2/m(2). The results
   also indicated that hospitals have the highest CO2 emissions factor
   associated with building operation with about 375 kg CO2/m(2)/year,
   while educational institutes have the lowest CO2 emissions factor of
   about 102 kg CO2/m(2)/year. Further, the results will be used to test
   the impact of performing different retrofitting scenarios on the CO2
   emissions behavior. It would be interesting for future work to analyze
   the impact of using smart and sustainable energy fixtures on CO2
   emissions.},

Abstract = {This study developed novel metrics and utilized content analysis in
   terms of keywords selected, scholarly publications, and social media
   posts to identify trends and industry involvement. A data set of
   publications was created based on collected materials from Scopus and
   social media and analyzed using statistical tests, rigorous content
   analysis, and network analysis. The data set was used to develop a
   framework for assessing the maturity of research topics and a
   classification system for labeling publications. The framework includes
   some indicators, such as total publications and a variety of
   applications, which are assessed based on a scale of 4. The
   classification system suggests four components: (1) product, (2)
   construction and demolition waste, (3) additives, and (4) experiments to
   be considered by authors. The framework and the categorization system
   may assist academics and practitioners in predicting topic trends and
   offer a set of indicators for conducting systematic reviews to identify
   gaps in the literature. Also, total publications as one of the framework
   indicators reveals that 46\% of Canadian publications and 20.7\% of US
   publications exhibited industry involvement compared with 15\% of
   Australian publications and 15\% of UK publications. The analysis shows
   that the top-occurring keyword in the data set is recycled asphalt
   pavement, which is linked to 22.2\% of the data set, followed by
   recycled concrete and recycled aggregate concrete appearing in 12\%.
   Aside from keywords related to materials, two of the most commonly
   occurring techniques in the data set of keywords are building
   information modeling and life cycle assessment, which still need further
   investigation along with GIS for waste minimization.},

Abstract = {Dwelling renovation has gained major importance in the European Union
   due to the current need for the urban regeneration of many cities, most
   of whose existing buildings (approximately 60\%) were built in the 1960s
   to 1980s. These renovations require improvements in aspects such as
   structural integrity, accessibility, and the updating of deteriorated or
   obsolescent installations. This reveals that building renovations
   constitute a key factor in the future of the European building sector
   and must be included in strategies both for the reduction of this
   sector's environmental impact and for climate change mitigation. In
   order to determine the effectiveness of renovations and their impact,
   the HEREVEA (Huella Ecologica de la Rehabilitacion de Viviendas en
   Andalucia or Ecological Footprint of the Renovation of Dwellings in
   Andalusia) model is proposed on data obtained from the project's bill of
   quantities, its ecological footprint is assessed, and the
   economic-environmental feasibility of different proposals are evaluated
   simultaneously. The resulting model is integrated into a geographic
   information system, which allows georeferenced results. The tool can be
   used for sustainable and resilient planning policy-making at all
   government levels, and for the decision-making processes. In this paper,
   economic and environmental indicators are, for the first time,
   simultaneously assessed through statistical normalization obtained from
   50 cases analyzed in the city of Seville. Furthermore, five case studies
   are assessed in detail in order to determine the sensitivity of the
   model. These renovations represent less than 30\% of the cost and 6\% of
   the ecological footprint of a new construction project. During the
   subsequent 25 years, the energy efficiency improvements could
   significantly reduce the CO2 emissions that are due to direct
   consumption.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for the analysis of technological
   innovation processes in transnational contexts. By drawing on existing
   innovation system concepts and recent elaborations on the globalization
   of innovation, we develop a multi-scalar conceptualization of innovation
   systems. Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the
   generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the
   establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation
   system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology
   of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and
   valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework
   is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries.
   We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for
   developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature
   and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial
   complexity in the innovation process.},

Abstract = {This paper performs a multi-national assessment to provide a more
   comprehensive vision of the potential implementation of Rooftop
   Greenhouses in retail parks from a theoretical perspective. A geographic
   information system life cycle assessment method is used to quantify both
   the potential and the expected benefits of implementing rooftop
   greenhouses. We evaluate eight case studies in Europe and South America,
   paying attention to geographical constrasts (e.g., climate). We also
   focus on comparing the differences between isolated rooftop greenhouses
   and integrated rooftop greenhouses by evaluating the implications of a
   symbiotic metabolism. Results showed that retail parks have a large
   potential for the implementation of rooftop greenhouses in the
   short-term (53-98\% of the rooftops are technically and economically
   feasible), being architecture one of the main constraints (i.e., roof
   material limited the potential to 11\% for the Colombian case). Retail
   parks performed better than industrial parks as urban locations for such
   projects. The employment of isolated rooftop greenhouses in these areas
   obtained large values of production (31-234 tonnes of tomato per ha),
   CO2 savings (16-112 tonnes of CO2 eq per ha) and food self-supply
   (380-21,500 people per ha; 3.5-60\% of local tomato demand). When
   considering an industrial symbiosis approach, integrated rooftop
   greenhouses (with exchange of energy ,and CO2) could boost food
   production and self-supply values (up to 1.8 times) as well as the
   environmental benefits from local production (up to 2.5 times higher).
   Integrating the water flow from rainwater harvesting on the building
   into the crop production would ensure crop's water self-sufficiency,
   apart from one case (69\% of self-sufficiency). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In order to facilitate some urban management tasks, information
   regarding buildings needs to be represented in form of geospatial
   information. Some tasks in urban management such as indoor navigation,
   emergency response management, and processes in the construction life
   cycle e.g., site selection can be facilitated through the use of certain
   and sometimes high amount of, geometric and semantic information about a
   building. A Building Information Model (BIM) can be defined as a
   semantically rich shared 3D digital building model. Recent research has
   demonstrated that geometric and semantic information from BIMs can be
   transferred into the geospatial environment and CAD/GIS/BIM information
   can be integrated at web services level. This paper presents a
   comparative opportunity analysis on the future role of BIMs in Urban
   Data Management. The analysis presented was focused on exploring, the
   impact of progression in Building Information Modeling research, to the
   opportunities provided by the use of BIMs in Urban Data Management

Abstract = {Intelligent construction technology has been widely used in the field of
   railway engineering. This work first analyzes the connotation, function,
   and characteristics of intelligent construction of railway engineering
   (ICRE) and establishes its system structure from three dimensions,
   namely, life cycle, layers of management, and intelligent function, to
   deeply understand the development situation of intelligent railway
   construction in China. Second, seven key technical support systems of
   ICRE, which include building information modeling (BIM) standard system
   for China's railway sector, technology management platform and life
   cycle management based on BIM + GIS (geography information system),
   ubiquitous intelligent perception system, intelligent Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) communication system based on mobile interconnection, construction
   management platform based on cloud computing and big data, unmanned
   operation system based on artificial intelligence, intelligent machinery
   and robot, and intelligent operation and maintenance system based on BIM
   and PHM (prediction and health management), are established. Third, ICRE
   is divided into three development stages: primary (perception),
   intermediate (substitution), and advanced (intelligence). The evaluation
   index system of each stage is provided from the aspects of technology
   and function. Finally, this work summarizes and analyzes the application
   situation of ICRE in the entire railway sector of China, represented by
   Beijing-Zhangjiakou and Beijing-Xiong'an high-speed railways. Result
   shows that the technical support systems of the ICRE have emerged in
   China and are still in the process of deepening basic technology
   research and preliminary application. In the future, the ICRE of China's
   railway sector will develop toward a higher stage.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {253-265},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Electricity production causes unintended impacts. Their exclusion by the
   market leads to suboptimal resource allocations. Monetizing and
   internalizing of external costs, though challenging and debatable, leads
   to a better allocation of economic resources and welfare. In this paper,
   a life-cycle analysis (LCA) on the production of electricity from
   conventional coal based electricity generation system has been performed
   in order to examine the environmental impacts of coal based electricity
   generating systems in the twin-city of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar in
   western India. By using dose-response functions, we make an attempt to
   estimate the damages to human health, crops, and building materials
   resulting from the operation of coal power plants and its associated
   mines. Further, we use geographic information system to account for
   spatially dependent data. Finally, monetary values have been assigned to
   estimate the damage to human health, crops and building materials. This
   study reveals that the health as well as on non-health impacts of air
   pollution resulting from coal based electricity generation may not be
   ignored both in absolute as well as economic value terms. (C) 2012

Title = {Trading building demolition waste via digital twins},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Excessive building demolition waste (BDW) has become a major factor
   affecting the ecological environment. In recent years, scholars have
   explored BDW disposal from various perspectives, including policy,
   theory, and technology. However, the current recycling and reusing rate
   of BDW remains low. Thus, this paper explores a novel market-oriented
   circulation channel for BDW and proposes a BDW trading conceptual
   framework based on digital twin (DT). Two key technologies and four key
   services involved are discussed. To verify the effectiveness of the
   framework, a real-life case study is conducted by integrating IoT, big
   data, robotics, and 3D printing technologies. With the DT-based BDW
   trading system, BDW disposal processes could be accurately mapped.
   Contractors and recyclers could conduct online product browsing,
   communication, and transactions. The digital bi-directional information
   interaction shows great potential for improving the recycling and
   reusing rate of BDW.},

Abstract = {The life cycle of a building begins with the planning process. The
   planning or pre-planning stage is when the most effective decisions are
   made. Both in terms of time and financial resources, changes made to
   certain design solutions at this stage are less costly compared to later
   stages of architectural design, not to mention during the construction
   process itself. The success of a building's architectural planning
   solutions, how convenient the site and the building are to use and the
   economical indicators of constructing the building depend mostly on
   decisions made during the planning stage. BIM can be used for building
   spatial planning. This would allow architects to assess the planned
   building, its influence on the environment and the influence of the
   environment on the building even earlier and more comprehensively. The
   paper proposes a model and algorithm for the planning stage of building
   using BIM. Creating a spatial model for a building using the proposed
   algorithm will produce a model for specific building and site solutions.
   The entirety of the solutions used in the building and site design has
   been considered in compliance with all of the requirements of national
   law and compulsory regulatory technical documents. The model can then be
   used for further architectural design. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Green roofs have been more common in central Europe and are now being
   constructed on buildings around the world. As powerful mapping software,
   Google Earth can provide satellite photos of three-dimensional building
   roofs in big cities to GIS system. An application system integration
   with basic function of the environmental effect assessment and energy
   saving on green roof was designed by the technology of GIS and Google
   Earth. It is hoped that this designed application system can offer
   certain reference value for green roof management in urban area. This
   application system of green roofs assessment has been conducted to
   estimate the environment efficiency and energy saving compared to none
   green roof area in city. The green roof with useful environment
   efficiency including stormwater management, energy conservation, urban
   heat island effects mitigation, noise and air pollution reduce, urban
   biodiversity increase and more aesthetically pleasing environment, can
   be effectively assessed by designed application system. It is very
   evident that this application system with GIS and Google Earth
   technology can play an important role to manage and improve the green
   roof function. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or

Title = {A Data Processing Methodology to Analyze Construction and Demolition
   Dynamics in the European Metropolis of Lille, France},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the absence of industry data, organisms, and researchers leverage
   free and available data, specifically building and demolition permits.
   Geospatial processing is essential to integrate information from various
   files into a single GIS layer containing all relevant attributes for
   analysis. This article proposes a Geographic Information System (GIS)
   processing model aimed at monitoring construction and demolition
   dynamics in the European metropolis of Lille to quantify the urban
   production of mineral waste from buildings. Author methodology is based
   on that that the deposit potential can be analyzed using the observation
   of the spatiotemporal dynamics of building and demolition permits. The
   results demonstrate that combining construction and demolition (C\&D)
   permits with other GIS layers allows us to produce data to quantify
   demolition surfaces per year in a given French area. The applicability
   of this methodology extends to all French regions, providing insights
   into the impact of crises on deconstruction activities and C\&D waste
   generation. The study focuses on C\&D French public data bases (French
   government and European Metropolis of Lille) attributed to the region
   (area) of the European Metropolis of Lille (MEL) between 2013 and 2022.
   Some data for 2022 were incomplete due to ongoing treatment, emphasizing
   the importance of understanding the dynamics of demolition rates or
   surfaces to identify data gaps or errors. Historical trajectories of
   C\&D permits were quantified and analyzed, revealing over 21,000 permits
   granted from 2013 to 2022, categorized by site type (new construction,
   rehabilitations, prior declarations, and demolitions). Construction
   sites during this period covered approximately 3,345,948 m2,
   constituting 20\% of the MEL's building stock, while demolition sites
   amounted to 1,977,911 m2, equivalent to 5\% of the total area of
   buildings in the metropolis. Employing GIS allowed for a spatial
   analysis, visualizing data by municipality, urban fabric, and year. The
   analysis highlighted territories with high and low potential for
   demolition and construction, as well as the most impacted urban fabrics
   and dynamic periods. The article discusses potential crisis impacts
   (e.g., COVID-19 or economic downturns) and the implications of
   incomplete data. Finally, the study demonstrates how these findings can
   be utilized to quantify C\&D waste, leveraging GIS and the production
   rate calculation method (GRC).},

Abstract = {The implementation of railway intelligent construction is the need of
   national strategic development and the demand of society. Based on the
   idea of system engineering, this paper proposes a three-dimensional
   railway intelligent construction system architecture composed of a full
   life cycle, management level and technical support. Based on this
   architecture, a ``three-step{''} implementation path is proposed. Then,
   it analyzes the technology support framework required in the
   architecture based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), incorporating
   Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS),
   algorithmic prediction and machine learning technology, Internet of
   Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technology, big data and cloud
   computing technology, and the application of railway intelligent
   construction system architecture is analyzed by taking a railway tunnel
   project in Zhejiang Province of China as an example. Finally, it
   discusses the problems that may be encountered in the implementation of
   railway intelligent construction and puts forward relevant suggestions.
   The results show that railway intelligent construction is an essential
   way. At present, China's railway intelligent construction is still in
   the primary stage. The design organization should do a good job in the
   top-level design and accumulate sufficient data for the later stage. All
   parties in the middle stage of construction should do a good job in the
   induction and integration of information and accumulate sufficient
   experience. In this way, we can integrate into the advanced stage and
   give full play to the advantages of software and hardware integrated
   applications such as BIM, IoT, big data, cloud computing and intelligent
   devices so as to truly realize the intellectualization and modernization
   of railway construction.},

Abstract = {Several important goals for Urban GIS involve to Documentation,
   Information and Management Systems (DiMAS). Nowadays, there are good
   solutions for each one of them, but their integration poses still some
   non-trivial challenges. Between others, these challenges involve to a)
   interoperability between different tools, b) customized provision of
   services, and c) interactive dialogue with changing environments for
   different kinds of agents. In this work we describe our work in progress
   for the three mentioned issues which is being applied to Cultural
   Heritage Urban environments. The GIRAPIM solution developed in this work
   uses CityGML as a general semantic framework for integrating the above
   cited three systems, and displays some applications for interventions in
   public buildings and small urban districts with interest from the
   Cultural Heritage viewpoint. Some specific contributions of our approach
   concern to range-based modeling, the development of a specific Ontology
   common to DiMAS and the provision of web services along the life-cycle
   of intervention on the building or a small urban environment. The
   methodology is being applied for surveying interventions in isolated
   historic building and small urban district in several Spanish urban
   cities with interest from the Cultural Heritage viewpoint.},

Title = {Publishing authoritative geospatial data to support interlinking of
   building information models},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a key enabler to support
   integration of building data within the buildings life cycle (BLC) and
   is an important aspect to support a wide range of use cases, related to
   intelligent automation, navigation, energy efficiency, sustainability
   and so forth. Open building data faces several challenges related to
   standardization, data interdependency, data access, and security. In
   addition to these technical challenges, there remains the barrier among
   BIM developers who wish to protect their intellectual property, as full
   3D BIM development requires expertise and effort. This means that there
   is often limited availability of building data. However, a Linked Data
   approach to BIM, combined with a supporting national geospatial
   identifier infrastructure makes interlinking and controlled sharing of
   BIM models possible. In Ireland, the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi)
   maintains a substantial data set, called Prime2, which includes not only
   building GIS data (polygon footprint, geodetic coordinate), but also
   additional building specific data (e.g. form, function and status). The
   data set also includes change information, recording when changes took
   place and who captured and validated those changes. This paper presents
   the development of a national geospatial identifier infrastructure based
   on an OSi building ontology that supports capturing OSi building data
   using Resource Description Framework (RDF). The paper details the
   different steps required to generate the ontology and publish the data.
   First, an initial analysis of the data set to generate the ontology is
   discussed. This includes identification of mappings to existing
   standards, e.g. GeoSPARQL to handle geometries and PROV-O to handle
   provenance, to the development of R2RML mappings to generate the RDF and
   the method for deploying the ontology and the building graphs. This data
   is then made available dependent on different licensing agreements
   handled by an access control approach. Methods are then presented to
   support the interlinking of the authoritative data with other building
   data standards and data sets using geolocation, followed finally by
   discussion and future work.},

   performance of building structures in Geneva from 1850 to 2018},
Journal = {CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Load -bearing systems in buildings, significant in material use and
   embodied greenhouse gas emissions (EGHGE), have lacked detailed analysis
   on their environmental and functional relationships over time and space.
   This study evaluates the environmental impacts of building structures in
   Geneva, Switzerland, considering factors like material usage, EGHGE, and
   urban development. A new method using a similarity -weighted function
   projects environmental impacts onto a GIS-based building stock,
   analysing 48 archetypal and 84,477 stock buildings built from 1850 to
   2018. Results show a 37\% reduction in structural volume per floor area
   and a 10\% increase in mass over time. Buildings predating the masonry
   -to -concrete transition would produce 7\% more EGHGE if constructed
   today. Multi -residential buildings emit 14\% less EGHGE than single
   homes. A new indicator amortizes upfront environmental effects over a
   building `s lifespan, aiding in historical comparisons of building
   stocks. This approach underscores the need for spatial -temporal
   environmental impact mapping to understand sustainable urban development
   dynamics.},

Title = {Implementation of an Automated Code Checking Algorithm Based on Site
   Analysis},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To date, BIM has been primarily utilized in cost and schedule
   management, an interference check between architectural and structural
   models and systems based on geometric data in the process of the
   construction life cycle. However, there is a lack of research that
   utilizes the information contained in the BIM model to review whether
   the proposed architectural model is appropriately designed in accordance
   with each country's building regulations or building codes or that
   proposes a model optimized for laws and standards. `Building code
   checking' is the step of reviewing whether a building designed based on
   the building codes is suitable for being constructed as a building.
   However, this process consumes significant time and money and leads to
   human errors due to the manual review process. This study included
   implementation of an algorithm based on the Korean building code. In
   this study, there was the process of selection of codes when architects
   interpret building codes in common and implementation based on the codes
   selected. Next, modeling based on DXF files from NGII (National
   Geographic Information Institute) was applied to the algorithm developed
   in this study. Last, it includes case studies that compare the outputs
   of the algorithm with the real buildings, which had received real code
   checking, to make sure the algorithm in this paper is working properly.
   The implementation of such an automated system has the potential to
   significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the building
   design and construction process. It can help architects to quickly and
   accurately identify potential legal issues and provide alternative
   solutions that meet regulatory requirements. This, in turn, can lead to
   reduced project costs, improved quality of designs, and faster project
   delivery times.},

Title = {Building material stock analysis is critical for effective circular
   economy strategies: a comprehensive review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Buildings account for the largest share of accumulated materials and
   waste globally. Tracking the material composition, quantity and location
   of these materials, known as building material stock analysis (MSA), is
   a first step in enabling the reuse or repurposing of materials, key
   strategies of the circular economy. While the number of building MSAs is
   growing, there is a need to coalesce methods, data and scope. Therefore,
   in this work, we reviewed and evaluated 62 journal and conference
   articles on MSA of buildings from different angles including scope,
   boundaries, archetype classification, material intensity determination,
   approaches (i.e. bottom-up, top-down, remote sensing) and quantity of
   materials to identify barriers, gaps and opportunities in this area
   along with its implications for decision-making, policy and regulations.
   We cataloged the three major approaches of MSAs and discuss their
   advantages and shortcomings. We also created a comprehensive directory
   of building archetypes, references and materials for future researchers.
   As expected, most of the studies estimated that concrete had the largest
   mass compared with other materials; however, mass-based distribution of
   materials showed significant variations in different building stocks
   across the world. Also, embedded plastics and their types remain
   under-represented in current studies. A major barrier to MSA is related

Abstract = {The construction industry is recognized as a major cause of
   environmental pollution, and it is important to quantify and evaluate
   building energy. As interest in big data has increased over the past 20
   years, research using big data is active. However, the links and
   contents of much literature have not been summarized, and systematic
   literature studies are insufficient. The objective of this study was a
   holistic review of building energy efficiency/reduction based on big
   data. This review study used a holistic analysis approach method
   framework. As a result of the analysis, China, the Republic of Korea,
   and the USA had the most published papers, and the simulation and
   optimization area occupied the highest percentage with 33.33\%. Most of
   the researched literature was papers after 2015, and it was analyzed
   because many countries introduced environmental policies after the 2015
   UN Conference on Climate Change. This study can be helpful in
   understanding the current research progress to understand the latest
   trends and to set the direction for further research related to big
   data.},

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {To reduce the energy consumption of buildings by installing PV panels
   therein, it is important to accu-rately predict the technical and
   economic performance of the PV panels to be installed and to determine
   whether their installation will result in profits. In this study, a
   window-integrated PV system was pro-posed that combines the exterior
   window of a building with PV panels, and its technical and economic
   performance was analyzed. To this end, a residential building in Seoul,
   the most populous area in South Korea, was used as a reference model,
   and third-generation PV panels were analyzed. The main findings are as
   follows. First, with respect to the technical performance of the PV
   panels, the window -integrated OPV system installed in household type B
   generated the most annual electricity (923.34kWh). However, the
   window-integrated OPV system installed in household type C generated the
   most annual electricity per unit area (36.64 kWh/m2). Second, the NPV20
   and SIR20 increased as the household's monthly electricity consumption
   increased and the closer to the south the orientation of the PV panel
   was. These results show that the window-integrated PV system that used
   the third -generation PV panel is expected to be one of the active
   strategies for achieving net-zero-energy buildings.(c) 2023 Elsevier

Title = {Component-Based Model for Building Material Stock and Waste-Flow
   Characterization: A Case in the ile-de-France Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building demolition is one of the main sources of waste generation in
   urban areas and is a growing problem for cities due to the generated
   environmental impacts. To promote high levels of circular economy, it is
   necessary to better understand the waste-flow composition; nevertheless,
   material flow studies typically focus on low levels of detail. This
   article presents a model based on a bottom-up macro-component approach,
   which allows the multiscale characterization of construction materials
   and the estimation of demolition waste flows, a model that we call the
   BTP-flux model. Data mining, analytical techniques, and geographic
   information system (GIS) tools were used to assess different datasets
   available at the national level and develop a common database for French
   buildings: BDNB. Generic information for buildings in the BDNB is then
   enriched by coupling every building with a catalog of macro-components
   (TyPy), thus allowing the building's physical description. Subsequently,
   stock and demolition flows are calculated by aggregation and classified
   into 32 waste categories. The BTP-flux model was applied in
   ile-de-France in a sample of 101,320 buildings for residential and
   non-residential uses, representative of the assessed population
   (1,968,242 buildings). In the case of ile-de-France, the building stock
   and the total demolition flows were estimated at 1382 Mt and 4065 kt,
   respectively. For its inter-regional areas-departments-, stock and
   demolition waste can vary between 85 and 138 tons/cap and 0.263 and
   0.486 tons/cap/year, respectively. The mean of the total demolition
   wastes was estimated at 0.33 tons/cap/year for the region. Results could
   encourage scientists, planners, and stakeholders to develop pathways
   towards a circular economy in the construction sector by implementing
   strategies for better management of waste recovery and reintegrating in
   economic circuits, while preserving a maximum of their added value.},

Abstract = {The strict CO2 emission targets set to tackle the global climate change
   associated with greenhouse gas emission exerts so much pressure on our
   cities which contribute up to 75\% of the global carbon dioxide emission
   level, with buildings being the largest contributor {[}1]. Premised on
   this fact, urban planners are required to implement proactive energy
   planning strategies not only to meet these targets but also ensure that
   future cities development is performed in a way that promotes
   energy-efficiency. This article gives an overview of the state-of-art of
   energy planning and forecasting approaches for aiding physical
   improvement strategies in the building sector. Unlike previous reviews,
   which have addressed mainly the strengths as well as weaknesses of some
   of the approaches while referring to some relevant examples from the
   literature, this article focuses on critically analysing more approaches
   namely; 2D GIS and 3DGIS (CityGML) based energy prediction approaches,
   based on their frequent intervention scale, applicability in the
   building life cycle, and conventional prediction process. This will be
   followed by unravelling the gaps and issues pertaining to the reviewed
   approaches. Finally, based on the identified problems, future research
   prospects are recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to propose a methodology to support the
   production of Climate and Energy Plans in Norwegian municipalities by
   analyzing whether locally available woody biomass, specifically forest
   logging residues, within the municipality (in this case, Fredrikstad),
   could cover the demand for heating in municipality buildings over the
   next 20 years. Three different tools, a geoprocessing tool for forestry
   (GEOSKOG), a methodology for environmental assessment (Life Cycle
   Assessment) and a tool for processing geographical data (Geographical
   Information System), were used in combination with energy data related
   to municipal buildings. The goal was to quantify the share of energy
   end-use (heat) that could potentially be replaced by bioenergy from
   forest logging residues and to calculate the potential GHG benefits from
   this substitution. The annual heating demand for municipal buildings in
   Fredrilcstad currently heated by electric and oil boilers was 93 GWh.
   The potential annual GHG savings from the bioenergy substitution of
   fossil fuel (oil) boilers and electric boilers (Norwegian and Nordic
   electricity mix) equaled 292 tonnes CO2-eq, 95 tonnes CO2-eq and 535
   tonnes CO2-eq respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Moving beyond land use intensity types: assessing biodiversity impacts
   using fuzzy thinking},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1338-1356},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Purpose The impact of land use on biodiversity is a topic that has
   received considerable attention in life cycle assessment (LCA). The
   methodology to assess biodiversity in LCA has been improved in the past
   decades. This paper contributes to this progress by building on the
   concept of conditions for maintained biodiversity. It describes the
   theory for the development of mathematical functions representing the
   impact of land uses and management practices on biodiversity. Methods
   The method proposed here describes the impact of land use on
   biodiversity as a decrease in biodiversity potential, capturing the
   impact of management practices. The method can be applied with weighting
   between regions, such as ecoregions. The biodiversity potential is
   calculated through functions that describe not only parameters which are
   relevant to biodiversity, for example, deadwood in a forest, but also
   the relationships between those parameters. For example, maximum
   biodiversity would hypothetically occur when the nutrient balance is
   ideal and no pesticide is applied. As these relationships may not be
   readily quantified, we propose the use of fuzzy thinking for
   biodiversity assessment, using AND/OR operators. The method allows the
   inclusion of context parameters that represent neither the management
   nor the land use practice being investigated, but are nevertheless
   relevant to biodiversity. The parameters and relationships can be
   defined by either literature or expert interviews. We give
   recommendations on how to create the biodiversity potential functions by
   providing the reader with a set of questions that can help build the
   functions and find the relationship between parameters. Results and
   discussion We present a simplified case study of paper production in the
   Scandinavian and Russian Taiga to demonstrate the applicability of the
   method. We apply the method to two scenarios, one representing an
   intensive forestry practice, and another representing lower intensity
   forestry management. The results communicate the differences between the
   two scenarios quantitatively, but more importantly, are able to provide
   guidance on improved management. We discuss the advantages of this
   condition-based approach compared to pre-defined intensity classes. The
   potential drawbacks of defining potential functions from
   industry-derived studies are pointed out. This method also provides a
   less strict approach to a reference situation, consequently allowing the
   adequate assessment of cases in which the most beneficial biodiversity
   state is achieved through management practices. Conclusions The
   originality of using fuzzy thinking is that it enables land use
   management practices to be accounted for in LCA without requiring
   sub-categories for different intensities to be explicitly established,
   thus moving beyond the classification of land use practices. The
   proposed method is another LCIA step toward closing the gap between land
   use management practices and biodiversity conservation goals.},

Abstract = {Today in Europe building-sector is responsible for the 50\% of air
   pollution and for 70\% of waste production. For this reason,
   researchers' interest is focused on new eco-building materials that are
   sustainable, with low impact, renewable and recyclable. In this context,
   in the last few years, the use of cellulose-based fibres as potential
   reinforcements for bio-composite materials, instead of synthetic one,
   received worldwide growing attention. Among natural fibres, both
   cellulose and protein-based ones, in literature it was found that, due
   to its mechanical properties, artichoke fibre is suitable for this use.
   In this study, a Geographical Information System (GIS) - based model to
   locate and quantify the yearly amount of agricultural waste coming from
   Cynara cardunculus L. (CW) cultivation was put forward and was applied
   in a study area located in Southern Italy. As an additional
   protein-based fibre, sheep wool fibre was also taken into account due to
   the high presence of sheep. The estimated available amount of both
   considered fibres was reported in a GIS map in order to show their
   distribution at territorial level. The achieved results could represent
   basic information for both sustainable locating collection centre and
   analysing the environmental impact related to the logistics and supply
   phase.},

Abstract = {Buildings are an important part of society's environmental impacts, both
   in the construction and in the use phase. As the energy performance of
   buildings improve, construction materials become more important as a
   cause of environmental impact. Less attention has been given to those
   materials. We explore, as an alternative for conventional buildings, the
   use of biobased materials and circular building practices. In addition
   to building design, we analyze the effect of urbanization. We assess the
   potential to close material cycles together with the material related
   impact, between 2018 and 2050 in the Netherlands. Our results show a
   limited potential to close material cycles until 2050, as a result of
   slow stock turnover and growth of the building stock. At present,
   end-of-life recycling rates are low, further limiting circularity.
   Primary material demand can be lowered when shifting toward biobased or
   circular construction. This shift also reduces material related carbon
   emissions. Large-scale implementation of biobased construction, however,
   drastically increases land area required for wood production. Material
   demand differs strongly spatially and depends on the degree of
   urbanization. Urbanization results in higher building replacement rates,
   but constructed dwellings are generally small compared to scenarios with
   more rural developments. The approach presented in this work can be used
   to analyze strategies aimed at closing material cycles in the building
   sector and lowering buildings' embodied environmental impact, at
   different spatial scales.},

Abstract = {This study estimates the amount of urban ores in Taipei City between
   1965 and 2014 by analyzing data of the buildings through statistics and
   geographical information systems (GIS). Hot spot analysis (HSA) is
   introduced to assess the location of resources. Our results show that up
   to the year 2014, 186 Mton of construction materials were accumulated in
   Taipei, and the per capita total building material stock was 68 ton. In
   the short term, the hot spots with development potential are Da'an (Zone
   I) and Zhongshan (Zone II) Districts in Taipei City. Zone I (0.1 km(2))
   stored 180 kton of materials; while Zone II (0.6 km(2)) stored 119 kton
   of materials. This study provides quantitative data on urban ores with
   high spatial and temporal resolution for enhancing material recycling
   planning and management. Material stocks could then combine with the
   material flow to build a dynamic material flow model for assessing the
   quantity of extractable urban ores, and the feasibility of exploitation
   in the future.},

Title = {How Spatial Analysis Can Help Enhance Material Stocks and Flows
   Analysis?},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Spatial information can be integrated into almost all fields of
   industrial ecology. Many researchers have shown that spatial proximity
   affects a variety of behaviors and interactions, and thus matters for
   materials stocks and flows analysis. However, normal tools or models in
   industrial ecology based on temporal dependence cannot be simply applied
   to the case of spatial dependence. This paper proposes a framework
   integrating material stocks and flows analysis with spatial analysis. We
   argue that spatial analysis can help data management and visualization,
   determine spatio-temporal patterns-processes-drivers, and finally
   develop dynamic and spatially explicit models, to improve the
   performance of simulating and assessing stocks and flows of materials.
   Scaling in spatial, temporal, and organizational dimensions and other
   current limitations are also discussed. Combined with spatial analysis,
   industrial ecology can really be more powerful in achieving its origin
   and destination-sustainability.},

   results obtained provide meaningful and detailed information about the
   energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions of the residential
   stock. The information can be, for instance, used in various hot spot

   behavioral changes can be assessed. These types of analysis can be
   useful for policy makers in order to prioritize actions cost
   efficiently, such as carrying out renovations in the residential sector.

Abstract = {Bridges are one of the most important elements of a sustainable
   transportation infrastructure network and require significant care to
   guarantee they function in a safe and reliable manner. Ensuring
   effective bridge maintenance and life cycle management in the face of
   aging and deterioration requires precise performance data and efficient
   assessment technologies. Because of the overall mediocre quality of U.S.
   infrastructure, there is a crucial need to enhance its monitoring and
   management. Digital twin is an emerging and promising concept that can
   offer the required solution. Advances in sensors, computing,
   communications, and predictive data analytics, coupled with biannual
   inspections, offer a wealth of bridge assessment data that will need a
   centralized digital twin framework for integration, analysis, and
   optimal decision-making with regard to maintenance. Leveraging and
   integrating these technologies in the new paradigm of a bridge digital
   twin will provide state transportation agencies with additional
   resources not previously available to enhance bridge operation and
   maintenance. A major value of a digital twin is the new knowledge
   created by the integration of information resources. This paper provides
   a framework for bridge digital twin that incorporates existing
   technologies, namely, building information modeling, structural health
   monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and geographic
   information systems. The paper also provides an overview of practical
   applications and use cases of digital twin for bridges and structures,
   and offers an assessment of the challenges posed by the technology.},

Abstract = {The innovations in the field of Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) over the
   last year have brought up some new technical solutions like the Highly
   Integrated Switchgear (HIS) which is leading to new applications in
   substations. The physical security and the availability has an
   increasing importance for today's substation solutions. Concepts based
   on Air Insulated Switchgear and Gas Insulted Switchgear are introduced
   to the market, and provide advantages in optimizing availability, safety
   and cost.
   Based on the HIS design, new applications in combination with
   infrastructures like office buildings, shopping malls or railway
   stations are possible. Solutions for future substations are not only
   related to the switchgear equipment, they are more and more complex
   system solutions, taking into account the equipment, environment and
   infrastructure synergies.
   In this paper these above mentioned aspects are explained and their
   impact is shown with examples.},

Title = {Framework for Automated Model-Based e-Permitting System for Municipal
   Jurisdictions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Recent technological advances in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry, including the implementation of building
   information modeling (BIM) and automated data-capturing tools, have
   enabled the AEC industry to commence its digital journey in the era of
   big data. Over the last decade, e-permitting practices have been
   introduced in many municipal jurisdictions around the world, aimed at
   replacing the traditional and inefficient paper-based practices. In this
   paper, these recent international developments are investigated, and
   three distinct levels of e-permitting are defined based on their varying
   levels of automation and integration. A framework is then developed that
   considers the impact of each level of e-permitting on the entire life
   cycle of the project, from submission of permitting document through
   construction, operation, and maintenance of the built facility. The
   developed framework can be used as a road map for any municipality for
   advancing from traditional paper-based permitting practices (Level 0) to
   a fully integrated city planning tool (Level 3), thus enabling several
   smart urban management applications, including city-level planning
   reviews, integrated logistics planning, and smart urban asset
   management. The framework as a whole was validated by a group of experts
   on construction permitting practices. Specific elements of its lower
   levels have been implemented by municipalities around the world, which
   have reported significant productivity improvements. Finally, this paper
   investigates several barriers to implementing the higher levels of
   e-permitting, along with corresponding strategies for municipalities to
   mitigate and overcome these challenges.},

Title = {Heating Energy Consumption and Environmental Implications Due to the
   Change in Daily Habits in Residential Buildings Derived from COVID-19
   Crisis: The Case of Barcelona, Spain},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis has changed daily habits and the time that people
   spend at home. It is expected that this change may have environmental
   implications because of buildings' heating energy demand. This paper
   studies the energy and environmental implications, from a Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) approach, due to these new daily habits in residential
   buildings at their current level of thermal insulation, and in different
   scenarios of thermal retrofit of their envelope. This study has a
   building-to-building approach by using Geographical Information Systems
   (GIS) for the residential housing stock in the case of Barcelona, Spain.
   The results show that a change in daily habits derived from the pandemic
   can increase the heating energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission
   in residential buildings by 182\%. Retrofitting all buildings of
   Barcelona, according to conventional energy renovation instead of nearly
   Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB), will produce between 2.25 x 10(7) and 2.57
   x 10(7) tons of carbon dioxide. Retrofitting the building stock using
   energy recovery is the option with better energy and emission savings,
   but also is the option with higher payback time for buildings built
   until 2007. The methodology presented can be applied in any city with
   sufficient cadastral data, and is considered optimal in the European
   context, as it goes for calculating the heating energy consumption.},

Abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) system is considered an unlimited source of clean
   energy, whose amount of electricity generation changes according to the
   monthly average daily solar radiation (MADSR). It is revealed that the
   MADSR distribution in South Korea has very diverse patterns due to the
   country's climatic and geographical characteristics. This study aimed to
   develop a MADSR estimation model for the location without the measured
   MADSR data, using an advanced case based reasoning (CBR) model, which is
   a hybrid methodology combining CBR with artificial neural network,
   multiregression analysis, and genetic algorithm. The average prediction
   accuracy of the advanced CBR model was very high at 95.69\%, and the
   standard deviation of the prediction accuracy was 3.67\%, showing a
   significant improvement in prediction accuracy and consistency. A case
   study was conducted to verify the proposed model. The proposed model
   could be useful for owner or construction manager in charge of
   determining whether or not to introduce the PV system and where to
   install it. Also, it would benefit contractors in a competitive bidding
   process to accurately estimate the electricity generation of the PV
   system in advance and to conduct an economic and environmental
   feasibility study from the life cycle perspective.},

Abstract = {This article presents the research work done in order to reduce the gap
   of heterogeneity between Geographic Information System and Building
   Information Models. The goal is to extend a platform dedicated to
   facility management called ACTIVe3D. We want to enlarge its scope to
   take into account the management of urban elements contained in the
   building environment, as well as other buildings. The particularity of
   the platform is that data can be accessed either by a semantic view or
   through a 3D interface. The SIGA3D project describes a set of processes
   that aims, for all the stakeholders of urban projects, to manage pieces
   of information through all the lifecycle of construction projects. To
   solve the heterogeneity problem between BIM and GIS, we developed a
   semantic extension to the BIM called UIM (Urban Information Modeling).
   This extension defines spatial, temporal and multi-representation
   concepts to build an extensible ontology. The knowledge database can be
   populated with information coming from standards like IFC and CityGML.
   This information system has been adapted and implemented into the
   existing platform and is today fully operational and used by thousands
   of users. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Estimating Materials Stocked by Land-Use Type in Historic Urban

Abstract = {The construction industry is an important contributor to urban economic
   development and consumes large volumes of building material that are
   stocked in cities over long periods. Those stocked spaces store valuable
   materials that may be available for recovery in the future. Thus
   quantifying the urban building stock is important for managing
   construction materials across the building life cycle. This article
   develops a new approach to urban building material stock analysis (MSA)
   using land-use heuristics. Our objective is to characterize buildings to
   understand materials stocked in place by: (1) developing, validating,
   and testing a new method for characterizing building stock by land-use
   type and (2) quantifying building stock and determining material
   fractions. We conduct a spatial MSA to quantify materials within a
   2.6-square-kilometer section of Philadelphia from 2004 to 2012. Data
   were collected for buildings classified by land-use type from many
   sources to create maps of material stock and spatial material intensity.
   In the spatial MSA, the land-use type that returned the largest
   footprint (by percentage) and greatest (number) of buildings were
   civic/institutional (42\%; 147) and residential (23\%; 275),
   respectively. The model was validated for total floor space and the
   absolute overall error (n = 46; 20\%) in 2004 and (n = 47; 24\%) in
   2012. Typically, commercial and residential land-use types returned the
   lowest overall error and weighted error. We present a promising
   alternative method for characterizing buildings in urban MSA that
   leverages multiple tools (geographical information systems {[}GIS],
   design codes, and building models) and test the method in historic
   Philadelphia.},

Abstract = {With the fast development of Chinese economy, expressway, as the most
   important portion of the highway networks, had been developed at an
   astonishing fast speed, which brought on increasingly severe ecological
   environmental problems in the mean time such as soil and water loss,
   damage of vegetation ecosystem, geological environment and water
   environment etc. As a result, the ecological environmental control of
   highway construction presents great strategic sense in realizing the
   coordination between the highway construction and the social, economic,
   environmental benefit.
   Based on the electric-map of land use of Chongming Island in 1:10000 and
   aided by the software of ARC GIS9.1, This paper, took the Chong-Qi
   Highway crossing Chongming Island as an example, selected the main
   ecological factors of water, arm, mudflat, forest wood and building
   areas, and carried on the risk assessment of them by an eco-control
   model of ecological node. As a result, the key ecological nodes of this
   case were selected the corresponding methods were put forward according
   to the life cycle of the highway.},

Abstract = {The lifeline disaster prevention. and mitigation engineering is a
   multi-system management process. The comprehensive information of
   lifeline engineering being quickly obtained after earthquake may help us
   ensure the fast and efficient rescue, thus one building information
   modeling of urban lifeline disaster prevention and mitigation will be
   proposed based on multi- dimensional and micro-information storage. The
   model is divided into the following four modules: data integration
   module, establishment and preliminary evaluation module, analysis of
   function module, and integrated application module, which will help
   implement sharing information resources for different tasks. In this
   model the factors that affect planning before the earthquake and
   recovery after earthquake are considered, characteristics of application
   modes are analyzed from the following five aspects: location and
   analysis, team working, maintenance information management in life
   cycle, disaster prediction and post-disaster recovery simulation,
   management of underground disaster space. Then a comprehensive urban
   lifeline disaster management platform is proposed based on the building
   information modeling as the key link which is characterized by
   integrity, visibility and collaboration. In this paper, the application
   is introduced by taking one city's building information modeling of
   water supply network disaster prevention and mitigation as an example.
   The results indicate that this model is practical to provide strategic
   decisions for disaster prevention and mitigation.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, the use of information management systems in the
   building data processing led to radical changes to the methods of data
   production, documentation and archiving. In particular, the
   possibilities, given by these information systems, to visualize the 3D
   model and to formulate queries have placed the question of the
   information sharing in digital format. The integration of information
   systems represents an efficient solution for defining smart, sustainable
   and resilient projects, such as conservation and restoration processes,
   giving the possibilities to combine heterogeneous data. GIS provides a
   robust data storage system, a definition of topological and semantic
   relationships and spatial queries. 3D GIS makes possible the creation of
   three-dimensional model in a geospatial context. To promote the
   interoperability of GIS data, the present research aims first to analyse
   methods of conversion in CityGML and IndoorGML model, defining an
   ontological domain. This has led to the creation of a new enriched
   model, based on connections among the different elements of the urban
   model in GIS environment, and to the possibility to formulate queries
   based on these relations. The second step consists in collecting all
   data translated into a specific format that fill a graph database in a
   semantic web environment, while maintaining those relationships. The
   semantic web technology represents an efficient tool of interoperability
   that leaves open the possibility to import BIM data in the same graph
   database and to join both GIS and BIM models. The outcome will offer
   substantial benefits during the entire project life cycle. This
   methodology can also be applied to cultural heritage where the
   information management plays a key role.},

Title = {Graph-based algorithmic design and decision-making framework for
   district heating and cooling plant positioning and network planning},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although buildings are the single largest users of energy in cities,
   many individual building HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning) systems are energy inefficient. Sustainable district
   heating and cooling systems have been developed to address this
   inefficiency, however, the implementation of district heating and
   cooling systems is a complex, capital intensive multivariate problem.
   One critical engineering problem, the location of energy production
   plant and pipe network topology, has a major influence on the system
   performance as well as the life cycle cost, and therefore should be
   comprehensively studied and chosen. This paper proposes a novel
   algorithmic design and decision-making framework that uses multiple
   simultaneous criteria to generate and evaluate design alternatives of
   site selection and pipe network layout. The framework consists of three
   components: site location and topology generation, network sizing and
   evaluation, and multi-objective decisionmaking assistance. The proposed
   framework has been validated in a real-world district cooling greenfield
   project in China's metropolitan area. Results were compared against the
   engineers' best practices. It has shown that the proposed framework
   could find equally good or better designs in engineering and financial
   performance with CAPEX reduction of up to 15\%.},

Title = {GIS-Based Social Cost-Benefit Analysis on Integrated Urban Water
   Management in China: A Case Study of Sponge City in Harbin},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Climate change along with industrialization or urbanization, which uses
   materials with low water permeability and is accompanied by change in
   urban land use, are major reasons for frequent urban floods in many
   Chinese cities. Moreover, upgrading the drainage system can have
   numerous negative environmental impacts on the city, especially in
   districts with dense population and buildings. A new integrated urban
   water management (IUWM) strategy implemented in China, ``sponge
   city,{''} has gained significant attention in recent years. In this
   study, a novel framework is built to analyze the effectiveness of sponge
   city by 3D simulating urban inundation results and performing a
   cost-benefit analysis. Construction and maintenance fees are included in
   the costs list, and carbon reduction, air quality improvement, rainwater
   harvesting, and reduction of flood risk are included under benefits. The
   district of Nangang in Harbin city in Northeast China was chosen as a
   case study area. Finally, we conclude that the maximum precipitation of
   49.82 mm/h by sponge city can bring the inundation depth below a target
   depth in the target area. Further, though the sponge city project is not
   effective from a private perspective, it is effective from a social
   perspective.},

Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Continuously increasing amounts of construction and demolition waste
   (C\&DW) is a critical problem globally. As a quantitative modeling
   approach to solve complex problems, system dynamics (SD) is frequently
   adopted to help understand the dynamic interrelationship of contributing
   variables of C\&DW management and predict future behavior for both short
   and long-term decision making. However, there has been no systematic
   review of such SD applications to C\&DW management. The aim of this
   study is therefore to provide a systematic review of current
   applications of SD modeling to C\&DW management in order to identify
   research gaps and provide future related research opportunities. The
   novelty of this paper is that it is the first time that bibliometric
   visual analysis has been adopted to interpret visualized network maps of
   the co-occurrence of countries, keywords, and citations of selected
   articles on the application of SD modeling in C\&DW management. The SD
   modeling applications of these articles are comprehensively reviewed
   from the two main C\&D waste management perspective of the 3R principle
   and sustainability. The results reveal that more research effort has
   been made to reduce and recycle C\& DW than to reuse it, and that the
   economic and environmental performance of C\&DW attracts more attention
   than its social performance. The study suggests that to deepen and
   broaden the analysis of C\&DW management, future research could use
   hybrid models by combining SD with emerging techniques and tools, such
   as building information modeling, geographic information systems, and
   blockchain technology.},

Abstract = {Municipalities invest a lot of time and person-hours into manual
   building permit checks. With the increase in computational power and the
   use of Building Information Models (BIM) in the building design life
   cycle, several municipalities are investing in automating these checks
   using BIM and geo-data sets. However, few examples exist of tools
   effectively using geo-information with BIM. In order to address this
   gap, a project was developed with the municipality of Rotterdam (NL). In
   a previous phase, a tool was implemented, able to analyse the BIM data
   to extract the needed information for a few representative regulations.
   In order to extend and improve the previously developed tool, a
   web-based interface is now implemented and geo-data sets are integrated
   to the process allowing more powerful GeoBIM analysis. Three checks
   using both BIM and GIS data were implemented and tested: (i) The parcel
   limit check evaluates if the building's footprint derived from BIM falls
   within the parcel limit provided from the municipalities' parcel data
   sets. (ii) The height check evaluates the maximum building's relative
   height to the road's height. Finally, (iii) the road overhang check
   detects neighbouring roads to the parcel and evaluates the admissible
   overhang over that road. This paper presents these developments,
   including the type of input data that is needed for the checks, the
   tools for the three new GeoBIM checks (parcel limit check, height check,
   road overhang check) and the implementation in the web-based tool.},

Title = {A block-based selection method for road network generalization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-153},
Abstract = {When road symbols are shown in a size proportionate to the reduced
   scale, several problems of legibility may arise concerning the urban
   blocks. By the method proposed in this paper, in order to overcome these
   problems, urban block areas are enlarged through amalgamation and the
   intervening roads in the amalgams are eliminated. This method includes
   two new approaches for computation of threshold used in determination of
   important roads based on the connectivity measure, and for definition of
   minimum block space and area requirements based on graphic limits. A
   block life cycle was designed for amalgamation of blocks. For the
   amalgamation process, a new algorithm was developed. The experimental
   testing indicates that important roads and the roads surrounding the
   urban area have been preserved. A simpler and more legible road network
   has been acquired. This method can be described as a more holistic
   approach as the buildings are taken into account. The problems arising
   in the experimental testing indicate that the cartographic
   selection/elimination process is not sufficient by itself for road
   network generalization, which can be assumed as one of the integral
   parts of Digital Earth. As well as the selection/elimination, processes
   such as displacement and caricaturizing are also needed.},

   Boston, USA},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Urban parcels can potentially be leveraged for developing a local urban
   food system by growing high yield food crops. Here, a remote sensing and
   GIS-based modeling framework was developed to locate and quantify
   available area for urban fanning, including both rooftop and ground
   level areas in the city of Boston, MA, USA. Geoprocessing and spatial
   analysis tools were used to process geographic data layers for zoning,
   ownership, slope, soil quality, and adequate light availability. Surface
   slope (roof pitch) was determined for all buildings in the city through
   the creation of a digital surface map from remotely sensed LiDAR data.
   Potential parcels from ground level public and private vacant lots and
   underutilized residential and commercial areas were mapped using
   publicly available datasets. Approximately 922 ha of rooftop and 1,250
   ha of ground level parcels have been identified, representing 7.4\% and
   10\% of the total land area in Boston, respectively. Finally, food yield
   values for common urban agricultural crops were used to estimate the
   city's food production potential from the identified parcels. Despite
   Boston's density, the mapped areas have potential to produce enough
   fresh fruits and vegetables for Boston's population, while providing
   both environmental and economic co-benefits. The study outcome was
   compared with mapping and inventory results from other North American
   cities.},

Title = {Automatic Creation of 3D Documentation in CAD/BIM Based on Topology},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper deals with reverse engineering, namely the as-built
   documentation of actual construction. The input is data measured in the
   field using geodetic methods. In addition to modern methods of surveying
   3D objects, such as laser scanning, it is still necessary to use classic
   surveying using a total station. The bottleneck of the process is the
   creation of documentation of the construction, which is still created
   manually in the appropriate CAD/BIM software. The goal of this research
   was to find a method that would reduce the amount of manual work when
   drawing documentation in CAD/BIM to a minimum. The core of the solution
   is the use of a topology that interconnects the points measured
   in-field. The entire procedure has two parts: (1) creating a topological
   drawing template in a suitable CAD/GIS software (digital sketch) and (2)
   adding geometry to this sketch and creating a drawing using topological
   codes. This method was verified in practice by applying it to several
   specific buildings in the Czech Republic. The practical application of
   the method demonstrated 30\% time savings and a reduction in work and
   error rate in the entire process.},

Title = {Developing an Iranian green building assessment tool using decision
   making methods and geographical information system: Case study in
   Mashhad city},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Regarding the sustainable schemes, green building may be considered as
   an alternative for managing the energy use in developing countries such
   as Iran. Investigating green factors in the other systems, the aim of
   the present study was to propose a new set of comprehensive factors
   suits assessing green buildings and to evaluate them in the Iranian
   context to contribute a new aggregated rating tool for offices.
   Therefore, 8 major and 61 minor stakeholders were defined to cover all
   required criteria respecting previous studies, expert opinions and
   questionnaire forms. The defined criteria were weighted using multi
   criteria decision methods consisting of analytical hierarchy process,
   weighted harmonic mean and Shannon's entropy. Then, Iranian Green
   Building assessment Tool (IGBT), consisting five certification levels,
   was developed based on weighted factors to improve environmental, social
   and economic aspects in the construction process. After that,
   aggregating IGBT, Geographical Information System (GIS) and
   multi-criteria decision methods, the practical application of the
   proposed tool was implemented on 48 offices through a case study in the
   municipality of Mashhad, Iran. For this purpose, a spatial database of
   612 land uses was prepared to determine certification levels of the
   office buildings in the study area. The assessment procedure, applied in
   GIS, demonstrated five certified office buildings. Results of designing
   IGBT showed that the energy efficiency and the water efficiency, with
   the total score of 39\%, are the most significant factors for assessing
   green office buildings with respect to the vital circumstances of energy
   and water conservation. Also, comparing performance sensitivity to the
   five representative green building rating systems confirmed the
   reliability of the suggested tool based on measuring the criteria
   deviations. The outcomes provide a valuable reference to the policy
   makers in Iran and also could be a considerable suggestion to the future
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Carbon Emission Evaluation Method and Comparison Study of Transformer
   Substations Using Different Data Sources},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The construction of transformer substations in transmission lines is a
   systematic, technical, and complex project with the need for numerous
   materials and resources. Under the development of the green economy, the
   requirements for energy conservation and carbon reduction have improved;
   hence, an assessment of carbon emissions in transformer substations is
   urgently needed. A calculation method was proposed in the present study
   to analyze the carbon emissions of transformer substations with
   different kinds of data sources, which were collected from several
   practical projects in the west-to-east power transmission project. In
   this study, a detailed comparison and discussion regarding the
   differences in carbon emissions of 750 kV transformer substations caused
   by hydrology, geology, engineering quantity, and other factors were
   conducted. The mean value, standard deviation, and 90\% confidence
   interval of carbon emissions were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation
   through MATLAB. Results show that the total carbon emissions of the
   selected 750 kV transformer substations are between {[}56,000, 68,000] t
   CO2 eq. Construction engineering accounts for more than 50\% of carbon
   emissions, followed by installation engineering and additional services.
   In terms of input items, electricity distribution buildings contribute
   more than 39\% of total carbon emissions, followed by cable/earthing
   systems, which account for 14\% of total carbon emissions. Gas insulated
   switchgear (GIS) and air insulated switchgear (AIS) could adopt
   different types of equipment foundations, and GIS equipment foundations
   would generate fewer carbon emissions due to the smaller land area and
   input materials. This study can provide experience and reference for
   similar projects and further guide the substation carbon emission
   reduction work.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process concerning the
   formation of digital representations of the physical and functional
   features of built spaces. A significant increase of the BIM utilization
   in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector are
   becoming more accessible and functional. The BIM methodology was
   developed in order to provide an effective system for building
   management as well as to organize the collaboration between different
   parties. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is maintained by
   buildingSMART; enable an interoperable format for exchanging BIM data
   between different software platform which is capable of restoring both
   geometric information and rich semantic information of building
   components to support lifecycle data sharing. BIM provides a detailed 3D
   geometrical model with rich semantic data. In contrast, Geography
   Information Science (GIS) offers powerful spatial analytical tools. As
   the benefits brought by the integration of Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being
   proved by many researchers, further spatial analysis can be applied that
   can benefit indoor-outdoor integrated applications. Recent research has
   mainly discussed the process required for data conversion from BIM to
   GIS. Thus, more specifics requirements on the functionalities of a 3D
   indoor applications need to be considered. In this study, the use of BIM
   IFC for 3D indoor GIS was reviewed, especially on the data conversation,
   data management, and 3D spatial analysis. The aim of this paper is to
   reveal the 3D indoor GIS requirements for space management. Therefore,
   the requirements were analyzed in four aspects: 1) data level
   integration; 2) data management; 3) 3D indoor GIS analysis; and 4) 3D
   space management. 3D space management was developed according to the
   requirement. Future research will be testing the conversion data in a
   GIS environment, the data structure for the 3D indoor GIS will be
   designed and a prototype will be developed to demonstrate the spatial
   analysis functionalities for 3D space management.},

Abstract = {There were two collection, transportation and treatment models for rural
   domestic waste management: urban-rural disposal model and area-based
   disposal model. In the urban-rural disposal model, rural domestic waste
   is collected in villages, transferred in towns, and disposed in
   centralized disposal sites of county, whereas area-based disposal model
   meant that each village built its own small-scale domestic waste
   facility. The threshold of transportation distance between urban
   centralized disposal sites and villages determined which of these two
   models would be more cost-effective. In this study, a distance
   decision-making model to obtain the threshold of collection and
   transportation distance was proposed. Besides, by application of this
   distance decision-making model supported by GIS software, 14588 villages
   of Guangxi Province, China were recommended to apply urban-rural
   disposal model or area-based disposal model. Results showed that (1)
   distance threshold decreases as the population of village increases; (2)
   when the population size of the village was up to 20000 people, it was
   more cost-effective choosing area-based disposal model; (3) a total of
   10932 villages in Guangxi Province were recommended to select
   urban-rural disposal model, 71\% of which should expand treatment scales
   of urban centralized disposal sites. In addition, 3554 villages were
   recommended to select area-based disposal model; (4) the parameters of
   amount of per capita domestic waste output, the average life of the
   facilities, cost of building new small-scale area-based treatment
   facilities, and cost of collection and transportation of waste have high
   sensitivity for distance threshold estimation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the sustainable and fast development of Chinese
   economy, expressway, as the most important portion of the highway
   networks, had been developed at an astonishing fast speed, which brought
   on increasingly severe ecological environmental problems in the mean
   time such as soil and water loss, damage of vegetation ecosystem,
   geological environment, noise environment, atmospheric environment and
   water environment etc `. As a result, the development of ecological
   environmental control of highway construction presents great strategic
   sense in realizing the coordination between the highway construction and
   the social, economic, environmental benefit and promoting the
   sustainable development of highway traffic enterprise as well.
   Based on the electric-map of land use of Chongming Island in 1: 10000
   and aided by the software of ARC GIS9. 1, This paper, took the Chong-Qi
   Highway crossing Chongming Island as an example, aiming to an
   environment-friendly highway by pre-control the potentially undesirable
   impacts on the environment caused by the highway construction, analyzed
   the ecological elements and characteristics of the highway environment
   ecosystem, selected the main ecological. factors of water, farm,
   mudflat, forest wood and building areas, and carried on the risk
   assessment of them, developed an eco-control model of ecological node
   for the restoration of the environmental system. As a result, the key
   ecological nodes of this case were selected as four patches (including
   Beihu Lake mudflat, Interoperate one, Interoperate two and K7), six
   corridors (BeiHengyinhe River, Beipugang Watergate, Sixiao River,
   Liuxiao River, Qixiao River and Baxiao River) and many ecological nodes
   (including noise nodes, K31 and wetland purification system).
   Furthermore, the corresponding methods were put forward according to the
   life cycle of the highway.},

Title = {Identifying Spatial Relationships between Built Heritage Resources and
   Short-Term Rentals before the Covid-19 Pandemic: Exploratory
   Perspectives on Sustainability Issues},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Built heritage resources (BHRs) are multidimensional assets that need to
   be conceived under a sustainability and circular economy framework.
   Whereas it is essential that their conservation, management, and
   enjoyment are sustainable, it is also necessary that the environmental,
   cultural, and socio-economic contexts in which they are integrated are
   sustainable too. Like other amenities, BHRs can improve the quality of
   the urban environment and generate externalities; additionally, they may
   influence sectors such as real estate, hospitality, and tourism. In this
   framework, this contribution aims to identify spatial relationships
   occurring between BHRs and short-term rentals (STRs), i.e., a recent
   economic phenomenon facilitated by platforms such as Airbnb. Through the
   application of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis techniques and taking
   Turin (Italy) as a case study, this article provides evidence that
   spatial correlation patterns between BHRs and STRs exist, and that the
   areas most affected by STRs are the residential neighborhoods located in
   the proximity of the historic center of the city. Relations with other
   sets of socio-economic variables are highlighted too, and conclusions
   suggest that future studies are essential not only to monitor
   sustainability issues and reflect on new housing models and sustainable
   uses of buildings, but also to understand the evolution of the
   phenomenon in light of the pandemic Covid-19.},

Title = {Key factors for the BIM adoption by architects: a China study},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {732-748},
Abstract = {Purpose - There has been a growing attention to building information
   modeling (BIM) globally due to its benefits to various stages of a
   building's life cycle. To facilitate the implementation of BIM in the
   construction industry effectively, the purpose of this paper is to gain
   a better understanding of the mechanism for BIM adoption by
   practitioners such as architects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey of architects is
   conducted in Shenzhen, China. A structural equation model is built with
   survey data to identify the key factors affecting architects' BIM
   adoption in the design firms.
   Findings - It is found that motivation, technical defects of BIM and BIM
   capability are the statistically significant factors affecting
   architects' BIM adoption whereas management support and knowledge
   structure are not.
   Research limitations/implications - Only one architectural, engineering
   and construction (AEC) profession, i.e. architects were selected as
   research participants. In future, other professions such as construction
   engineers, project managers, etc. should be investigated with respect to
   their BIM adoption issues.
   Practical implications - BIM technology developers should improve the
   technology along the objectives of economic benefits, effectiveness and
   efficiency of BIM adoption. The compatibility and integration between
   BIM and other widely available software in the industry should also be
   improved. Moreover, AEC company and project managers should provide
   architects with opportunities of BIM training so that architects are
   more likely to apply BIM in future projects.
   Originality/value - A quantitative theoretical model, i.e. structural
   equation model is built to identify key factors affecting architects'
   BIM adoption, which takes one step further to reveal the BIM adoption
   mechanism in contrast to previous descriptive-oriented studies.},

Title = {How has Beijing's urban weight and composition changed with
   socioeconomic development?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {675},
Pages = {98-109},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {A city's in-use stock comprises the built environment and manufactured
   products, which shape a city's weight and play vital roles in human
   activities. However, researchers have not accurately quantified urban
   weight and its composition, or how stock types change during
   urbanization. We quantified Beijing's in-use stock from 1978 to 2015 by
   bottom-up material-flow analysis for building, infrastructure, and
   manufactured product stocks, with 11 sub-types (e.g., roads), and 54
   accounting items (e.g., expressways). We discuss the driving factors for
   changes in these stocks and their composition. Beijing's in-use stock
   increased from 224 Mt in 1978 to 1925 Mt in 2015, an increase of nearly
   9 times (19 times the global stock per unit area). This resulted
   primarily from increases in stocks that accounted for >20\% of the
   total: urban residential buildings (30\%), non-residential buildings
   (26\%), and roads (20\%), which grew to 15, 5, and 11 times the 1978
   levels, respectively. However, the growth rate of these stocks slowed by
   the end of the study period. Manufactured products represented <4\% of
   the stock, but grew fastest (increasing to 41 times the 1978 value),
   especially for durable consumer goods and vehicles. This category cannot
   be neglected because of the increasing purchasing power of residents.
   The trends for the stock weights remained strongly coupled with
   population factors, whereas the stocks showed relative decoupling from
   economic factors (e.g., GDP, investment). These results will help
   policymakers diagnose problems with Beijing's urban development, thereby
   improving estimates of future resource demand and providing insights
   into strategies to slow the increase in urban weight. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Mapping Climate Change, Natural Hazards and Tokyo's Built Heritage},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although climate change is well recognised as an important issue in
   Japan, there has been little interest from scientists or the public on
   the potential threat it poses to heritage. The present study maps the
   impact of emerging pressures on museums and historic buildings in the
   Tokyo Area. We examine a context to the threat in terms of fluctuating
   levels of visitors as a response to environmental issues, from SARS and
   COVID-19, through to earthquakes. GIS mapping allows a range of natural
   and human-induced hazards to be expressed as the spatial spread of risk.
   Temperature is increasing and Tokyo has a heat island which makes the
   city hotter than its surroundings. This adds to the effects of climate
   change. Temperature increases and a decline in relative humidity alter
   the potential for mould growth and change insect life cycles. The region
   is vulnerable to sea level rise, but flooding is also a likely outcome
   of increasingly intense falls of rain, especially during typhoons.
   Reclamation has raised the risk of liquefaction during earthquakes that
   are relatively frequent in Japan. Earthquakes cause structural damage
   and fires after the rupture of gas pipelines and collapse of electricity
   pylons. Fires from lightning strikes might also increase in a future
   Tokyo. These are especially relevant, as many Japanese heritage sites
   use wood for building materials. In parallel, more natural landscapes of
   the region are also affected by a changing climate. The shifting seasons
   already mean the earlier arrival of the cherry blossom and a later
   arrival of autumn colours and a lack of winter snow. The mapping
   exercise should highlight the spatial distribution of risk and the way
   it is likely to change, so it can contribute to longer term heritage
   management plans.},

Title = {Data Fusion for Smart Civil Infrastructure Management: A Conceptual
   Digital Twin Framework},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Effective civil infrastructure management necessitates the utilization
   of timely data across the entire asset lifecycle for condition
   assessment and predictive maintenance. A notable gap in current
   predictive maintenance practices is the reliance on single-source data
   instead of heterogeneous data, decreasing data accuracy, reliability,
   adaptability, and further effectiveness of engineering decision-making.
   Data fusion is thus demanded to transform low-dimensional decisions from
   individual sensors into high-dimensional ones for decision optimization.
   In this context, digital twin (DT) technology is set to revolutionize
   the civil infrastructure industry by facilitating real-time data
   processing and informed decision-making. However, data-driven smart
   civil infrastructure management using DT is not yet achieved, especially
   in terms of data fusion. This paper aims to establish a conceptual
   framework for harnessing DT technology with data fusion to ensure the
   efficiency of civil infrastructures throughout their lifecycle. To
   achieve this objective, a systematic review of 105 papers was conducted
   to thematically analyze data fusion approaches and DT frameworks for
   civil infrastructure management, including their applications, core DT
   technologies, and challenges. Several gaps are identified, such as the
   difficulty in data integration due to data heterogeneity, seamless
   interoperability, difficulties associated with data quality, maintaining
   the semantic features of big data, technological limitations, and
   complexities with algorithm selection. Given these challenges, this
   research proposed a framework emphasizing multilayer data fusion, the
   integration of open building information modeling (openBIM) and
   geographic information system (GIS) for immersive visualization and
   stakeholder engagement, and the adoption of extended industry foundation
   classes (IFC) for data integration throughout the asset lifecycle.},

Abstract = {By the mid-1990s, geographic information system (GIS) software was
   increasingly being used in the natural resources and defence domains.
   However, the high costs, inflexibility and inability to share geospatial
   data between systems were causing severe frustration, because users were
   forced to use inefficient, time-consuming and error-prone data transfer
   methods. This led to the foundation of the Open Geospatial Consortium
   (OGC) to develop international standards for interoperability. Today,
   the OGC community's standards form the basis for building open
   interfaces and encodings into location-based products and services for
   use around the world. In this interview, Dr Nadine Alameh, CEO of OGC,
   reflects on the progress that has been made over the past three decades,
   and what still needs to be done to make geospatial information truly
   `findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)' for the good
   of society as a whole.},

Abstract = {A strategy for sustainable development is a significant milestone on the
   road to a more socially, economically and environmentally responsible
   society. It creates a framework within which the stakeholders can make a
   strong contribution to a better future. Because of the merits and
   growing interest in sustainable development, the race is on for
   researchers and stakeholders in the construction sector to initiate
   actions to reduce the negative impacts of development and sharpen their
   competitive edge. The cities should be created with a vision which
   supports harmonious communities and living conditions through
   sustainable urban development. The resources must be used efficiently
   while reducing the development impact on human health and environment
   during the buildings' life cycle. Environmental auditing and
   pressure-state response based models to monitor sustainable development
   in Malaysia should be developed. A data availability and sharing system
   should be developed and implemented to facilitate for the use in the
   establishment of sustainable development and low carbon society. Ideas
   which affect millions of people and guide the policies of nations must
   be accessible to all. Only thus can they permeate the institutions from
   the local to the global level. Creating sustainable development and low
   carbon societies depends on the knowledge and involvement of all
   stakeholders in the industry. So what is our level of understanding of
   GIS and its application? The development of geospatial data in Malaysia
   is important because the successful implementation of sustainable
   development and low carbon projects depend largely on the availability
   of geospatial information. It would facilitate the stakeholders and
   resolve some of the problems regarding the availability, quality,
   organisation, accessibility and sharing of spatial information. The
   introduction of GIS may change the way for better sustainable urban
   development and low carbon society performance. The use of GIS is to
   improve decision making to implement development methods, awareness for
   the need for sustainable development and in development control to
   provide the information on the distance from the proclaimed objective.
   Malaysia should not fall in its attitude on sustainable development,
   green design, sustainable construction and a low carbon society.
   Literature review on GIS is carried out to understand the philosophy,
   concept, principles, challenges and advantages of using GIS for
   sustainable urban development and low carbon societies. This paper would
   encourage our understanding about the state of geographical information
   system (GIS) in sustainable development and its application which would
   further stimulate actions and strategies towards a sustainable built
   environment.},

Abstract = {As an effective livelihood approach to alleviate poverty without rural
   population migration, ethnic tourism has become the primary choice of
   economic development in ethnic areas worldwide in addition to
   traditional livelihood approaches. This article applies the theories of
   livelihood to study the community evolution driven by tourism livelihood
   and examine three mountainous tourism communities in different stages of
   tourist area life cycle. Drawing on the methods of GIS spatial analysis,
   semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, this article proposes a
   sustainable livelihood framework for ethnic tourism to explore the
   evolution of ethnic tourism communities by identifying changes in
   livelihood assets (natural, financial, social, cultural and human
   capitals) in the process of tourism development. The results show that
   the development of ethnic tourism has led to changes in the increase of
   building land, and the diversification of land use functions with a
   trend of shifting from meeting local villagers' living needs to
   satisfying tourists, income composition and uneven distribution of
   tourism income spatially. Ethnic tourism also led to the deterioration
   of traditional social management structure, collapse of neighboring
   relationship, the over- commercialization and staged authenticity of
   ethnic culture, as well as the gradual vanish of agricultural knowledge
   with a trend of increasing modern business knowledge and higher
   education. In addition, these changes, involving livelihood assets from
   natural, economic, human, social and cultural aspects are interrelated
   and interactive, which form new evolution characters of ethnic
   community. This study reveals the conflicts over livelihood approaches
   which have formed new vulnerabilities to impact on sustainable evolution
   of ethnic communities. This research provides implications for achieving
   the sustainable development of ethnic communities with the driving force
   of tourism livelihood.},

Title = {Semiautomated Railway Line Information Modeling Based on Asset
   Management Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) period is a critical and
   resource-intensive phase of the life cycle of railway line
   infrastructure. The O\&M of a railway line during this period requires a
   large amount of investment and labor. Thus, there is an urgent need for
   railway managers to seek more efficient management tools and methods to
   improve management efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
   Infrastructure-building information model (I-BIM) technology,
   characterized by its intuitive representation and high
   information-integration capabilities, has gained considerable traction
   with infrastructure industry researchers. In the context of existing
   railway lines, the absence of corresponding I-BIMs or similar technology
   owing to the immaturity of technical development at the time led to the
   use of manual modeling processes, which have limitations such as high
   cost, slow speed, and low efficiency. This paper presents an innovative,
   high-speed, semiautomated method for generating I-BIMs for existing
   railway lines and leveraging asset management data without incurring
   additional data collection costs. This approach leverages key modules
   such as line trajectory computation, element model generation, the
   linking of O\&M semantic information, and the visualization of asset
   health indexes, which can enable the swift and semiautomated creation of
   an O\&M-oriented I-BIM for railway lines. This process elevates
   traditional two-dimensional database tables into more intuitive,
   operation-oriented, and semantically rich models. This results in the
   provision of more efficient support for maintenance management decisions
   related to railway lines. The proposed method addresses the limitations
   of manual modeling processes and can pave the way for enhanced O\&M
   efficiency in the railway infrastructure sector.
   The absence of BIMs during the design and construction phase of existing
   railway lines, coupled with the high costs and error rates associated
   with manual modeling, constitute substantial barriers to the
   implementation of BIMs in operation and management. By leveraging the
   proposed semiautomated modeling approach, which relies on management
   data, site managers and researchers can rapidly establish basic I-BIMs.
   Although the asset ledgers and station equipment plans used in this
   approach originate from National Railway Administration, similar data
   sets should serve as fundamental inputs for railway line operation and
   maintenance worldwide. By deploying this method, field managers can
   enhance traditional two-dimensional (2D) asset ledgers into a
   three-dimensional (3D) I-BIM, thereby offering a more intuitive
   understanding of the assets within their jurisdiction. Owing to the
   integration of geographic information system maps into the model,
   personnel can directly query asset-related geographic information,
   potentially reducing the frequency and cost of off-site surveys. For
   researchers, using this method to establish a real-world model rapidly
   offers convenient access for further BIM-based applications, such as the
   integration of real-time data from on-site sensors to formulate digital
   twins.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the CR (Czech Republic), there are a lot of prefabricated housing
   estates built in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century, which are at the
   end of their life cycle. The main goal of the project was to evaluate
   the rate of energy savings in the long term due to the revitalization of
   prefabricated apartment buildings, and thus provide feedback to the
   relevant authorities on its effectiveness. Another goal was to evaluate
   selected parameters of living comfort in the locality for the purposes
   of the real estate market with the possibility of providing them to
   those interested in living in the locality. A complex of methods was
   used, which evaluate criteria from various spheres, such as environment,
   spatial relationships, social aspects, etc. The authors used a
   combination of multi-criterial analysis methods (MCA) and spatial
   analysis within a Geographical Information System (GIS). Of all MCA
   methods, weighted linear combination (WLC) was chosen as the most
   suitable. In the spatial analyses, the matter of solution was, above
   all, the distance to the center and the transport within the given
   locality. The above-mentioned methods served as a model for evaluating
   whether a panel house in question is or is not suitable for
   reconstruction. The input data of the model are spatial data-national
   map series of the CR, environmental data (noise maps, energy demands of
   buildings)-and statistical data obtained from various sources (city
   administration of Brno, relevant organizations, and interviews with
   respondents). Within Inquiry Form 3, potential groups of respondents
   were addressed: Group A-people over fifty, group B-young families with
   children, group C-students under 25. The projected model was tested in
   Brno city in the locality of Novy Liskovec (CR). The proposed model
   provided information on the quality of housing in a given locality in
   terms of energy intensity, noise pollution, transport accessibility, and
   civic amenities. The output is a multi-criteria model with GIS support,
   which is generally applicable. The results of the model analyses led to
   the demonstration of the effectiveness of revitalization. The results
   can be used for estate offices or other organizations in the form of
   graphical outputs of appropriate variants on the basis of solving a lot
   of criteria when searching for a suitable residence.},

Title = {FROM DATA TO 3D DIGITAL ARCHIVE: A GIS-BIM SPATIAL DATABASE FOR THE
   HISTORICAL CENTRE OF PAVIA (ITALY)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {459-471},
Abstract = {Historical city centres are called to be witnesses of the past while
   supporting modern life. The competing needs for conservation and
   transformation involved in their development introduce a complex and
   multidisciplinary problem, which can be handled only by using proper
   tools. In this framework, the definition of shared digital archives able
   to collect and organize heterogenous data is believed to be the first
   step for the creation of an effective knowledge base, capable of
   activating analyses and supporting decision-making processes. The study
   presented here starts from the discussion of the requirements that an
   information system on historical centres should meet, and proposes a
   workflow based on the interoperability between GIS (Geographic
   Information System) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) aimed at the
   realization of a spatial relational database founded on CityGML. The OGC
   (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard was chosen in view of its capacity
   of representing the objects with their geometrical, topological and
   semantic properties, by specifying their relationships in a hierarchical
   environment. With the idea of introducing a repeatable model, the whole
   process starts from easily retrievable data on the city and makes use of
   standard data models, classification systems, programming languages and,
   as much as possible, of open software and contents. In order to test and
   validate the process the case study of the historical centre of Pavia
   (Italy) is presented as an experiment at the urban scale, while a single
   historical building complex is modelled for the assessment of the
   compliance to higher Levels of Detail. The workflow used to manage and
   display the information employs Visual Programming Language (VPL) and
   follows a four stages process: the retrieval of the input data, the
   informative modelling (GIS or BIM), the conversion in CityGML and the
   inclusion in the relational database. As a result, a three-dimensional
   spatial relational database in a standard data model is defined, capable
   of harmonizing, storing and organizing building information on
   historical city centres.},

   and annual power generation of a PV system on the roof of urban
   buildings in China are further calculated, and the investment cost
   analysis of the buildings with a PV system is carried out. The results
   show that Chinese mainland city rooftop photovoltaic area has reached
   3.35 billion m(2). If urban roofs are used for photovoltaic power
   generation in China, the annual photovoltaic power generation capacity
   will be 672 billion kWh, which is about 61\% of the total annual
   electricity consumption of the whole society in 2020. On the other hand,
   the initial investment in the construction of an urban photovoltaic
   system is large, but most of them can realize the return of investment
   in a short period of 8-10 years. Moreover, in the effective life of the
   follow-up photovoltaic system, it will bring greater economic benefits,
   which is more than two times the initial investment. To further promote
   the process of social carbon peak and carbon neutrality in China, the
   construction of an urban photovoltaic system is very feasible.},

Title = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capabilities in the Design and
   Planning of Rural Settlements in China: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in
   China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural
   settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in
   China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven
   development between urban and rural in China, the environmental
   conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are
   still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and
   residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to
   optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a
   multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can
   significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements
   in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential
   experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to
   perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the
   design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this
   aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The
   review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and
   September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were
   adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through
   this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have
   significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and
   planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D
   modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental
   analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the
   discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that
   BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements'
   design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge
   management, simulation, and modeling. Based on the research results, it
   can be identified that knowledge management capabilities in BIM can
   effectively provide information support and knowledge assistance
   throughout the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China.
   BIM's simulation and modeling capabilities can simulate and demonstrate
   the rural environment and their internal structures in rural
   settlements' design and planning phase to achieve their environmental
   optimization, residential comfort improvement, clash detection, disaster
   prevention, and expenditure reduction. Moreover, the challenge and
   future directions of BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase
   of rural settlements in China are discussed and analyzed. This study can
   effectively promote and optimize the BIM utilization in the design and
   planning phase of rural settlements in China, to better enhance their
   environmental quality and residential experience.},

Abstract = {Elements that constitute the built environment are vast and so are the
   independent systems developed to model its various aspects. Many of
   these systems have been developed under various assumptions and
   approaches to execute functions that are distinct, complementary or
   sometimes similar. Furthermore, these systems are ever increasing in
   number and often assume similar nomenclatures and acronyms, thereby
   exacerbating the challenges of understanding their peculiar functions,
   definitions and differences. The current societal demand to improve
   sustainability performance through collaboration as well as whole-system
   and through-life thinking is driving the need to integrate independent
   systems associated with different aspects and scales of the built
   environment to deliver smart solutions and services that improve the
   well-being of citizens. The contemporary object-oriented digitization of
   real-world elements appears to provide a leeway for amalgamating the
   modelling systems of various domains in the built environment which we
   termed as built environment information modelling (BeIM). These domains
   include architecture, engineering, construction as well as urban
   planning and design. Applications such as building information
   modelling, geographic information systems and 3D city modelling systems
   are now being integrated for city modelling purposes. The various works
   directed at integrating these systems are examined, revealing that
   current research efforts on integration fall into three categories: (1)
   data/file conversion systems, (2) semantic mapping systems and (3) the
   hybrid of both. The review outcome suggests that good knowledge of these
   domains and how their respective systems operate is vital to pursuing
   holistic systems integration in the built environment.},

Abstract = {Herculaneum, buried by Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, was only extensively
   excavated during the twentieth century, revealing a remarkable level of
   preservation but also fragility of what had survived of this Roman
   seaside town. By the turn of the century, the conservation challenges,
   paired with the limited capacity of the authorities to respond, was
   putting the archaeological site at risk. The Herculaneum Conservation
   Project ('HCP'), a public-private project underway since 2001, has
   helped turnaround this situation with the presence of an
   interdisciplinary team working all year round alongside the public
   authority, today the Archaeological Park of Herculaneum. With the site
   in a more stable condition, HCP's attention in the last ten years
   shifted to building up knowledge and competencies for the
   self-sufficiency of the Park authority in the face of core long-term
   management obligations. A new focus on conservation proposals that meet
   the site's needs but are suited to public tendering found its maximum
   expression in planning long-term site maintenance cycles. Through the
   voices of the practitioners involved, the paper recounts the resources
   and approaches that have been developed in this regard, in particular
   the specific GIS module that breaks down the archaeological site into
   the items to be maintained and their relative importance. This massive
   register of `objects' - walls, architraves, doors, frescoes, mosaics,
   etc. - is the backbone of the three-year maintenance cycles developed by
   HCP adopting an innovative procurement framework for co-sourcing
   services and works in Italy, the first of which is now being implemented
   by the Park. A web-based application accessible by operators on site
   allows real time transmission of monitoring data and records of
   site-works underway to the database and GIS platform, satisfying
   immediate administrative needs and quality controls but also delineating
   the scope of subsequent maintenance cycles. Technological and management
   tools, shaped by, and responsive to, the needs of the site and their
   users (the heritage practitioners involved), have been put at the
   service of the entire life cycle of programmed maintenance at an urban
   scale, both administrative and technical aspects. This is part of a
   wider upward spiral of management improvements for the long-term
   sustainability of this important archaeological site.},

   construction: Current status and future perspectives},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is
   experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation
   and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology
   and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM),
   machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention
   owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven
   underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation
   as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are
   valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and
   maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the
   processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of
   BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction
   represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use
   in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the
   state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning,
   computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the
   digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1
   presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2
   introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals.
   Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and
   highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and
   geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4
   examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at
   different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the
   challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these
   emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and
   information integration throughout underground project lifecycle.
   Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps
   and future directions.},

Abstract = {Semantic web technologies are essential for seamless data exchange
   between Building Information Modelling and technologies such as the
   Internet of Things and Geographic Information Systems. However, rapid
   advancements complicate their implementation, making past reviews

   semantic web technologies are adopted, how and when they are used, and
   what the significant knowledge gaps undermining semantic web
   technologies' applications are. These questions collectively provide a
   much-needed context for this evolving field. A systematic literature
   review covering the past five years identifies 65 relevant papers from
   419 works. Findings indicate the dominance of the entire building
   lifecycle applications (27.7\%), and a trend shifting to specific
   lifecycle stages. This study provides insights into the latest

Title = {3D LiDAR and multi-technology collaboration for preservation of built
   heritage in China: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, the technical application of 3D LiDAR has gradually
   expanded to the field of built heritage. 3D scanning, high-precision
   measurement, and reconstruction have enriched the methods of built
   heritage preservation and significantly improved the quality of heritage
   preservation in China. 3D LiDAR has broken through the limitations of a
   single technology application and played a greater role in the field of
   heritage preservation on different scales. Through the collaboration of
   multi-technology, such as 3D printing, digital mapping, internet of
   things, machine learning, intelligent sensors, close-range
   photogrammetry, infrared detection, stress wave tomography, material
   analysis, XR technology, reverse engineering, etc., 3D LiDAR shows its
   technological advantages on exploring the remote real-time monitoring
   and digitization of the built heritage, geological and environmental
   data collection, prediction of sedimentation, deformation monitoring,
   weather monitoring,system life cycle health detection, digital
   reproduction of built heritage for developing scientific problems and
   engineering practices such as building contour recognition, information
   feature matching, structural reinforcement and damaged component
   replacement. In addition, through the docking with GIS, HBIM, XR, and
   CIM, it provides fine digital models and high-precision data benchmarks
   which contribute to the heritage visual reproduction; and through the
   docking with 3Ds Max, SketchUp, and other modeling software, it has
   contributed to the renewal design of the built heritage, space
   optimization, and the scientificity and rationality of the heritage
   value evaluation. However, past technology applications also highlighted
   many problems such as limited recorded information, a large amount of
   data, high difficulty in collaboration, non-standardized and fragmented
   data, and difficulty in data mining and comprehensive utilization. There
   are still deficiencies in building a built heritage data backplane, and
   the development of a dynamic, three-dimensional, intelligent and refined
   heritage monitoring system, and further research is needed on these
   issues. This study reviews the previous academic progress and
   application of 3D LiDAR in the reconstruction of built heritage and
   multi-technology collaboration in the process of preservation, clarifies
   the current research hotspots and methods, the frontier issues of
   concern, and also clarifies the specific problems and challenges in the

Title = {Engineering Graphics for Thermal Assessment: 3D Thermal Data
   Visualisation Based on Infrared Thermography, GIS and 3D Point Cloud

Abstract = {Engineering graphics are present in the design stage, but also
   constitute a way to communicate, analyse, and synthesise. In the
   Architecture-Engineering-Construction sector, graphical data become
   essential in analysing buildings and constructions throughout their
   lifecycles, such as in the thermal behaviour assessment of building
   envelopes. Scientific research has addressed the thermal image mapping
   onto three-dimensional (3D) models for visualisation and analysis.
   However, the 3D point cloud data creation of buildings' thermal
   behaviour directly from rectified infrared thermography (IRT)
   thermograms is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this paper develops an
   open-source software graphical method to produce 3D thermal data from
   IRT images for temperature visualisation and subsequent analysis. This
   low-cost approach uses both a geographic information system for the
   thermographic image rectification and the point clouds production, and
   3D point cloud processing software. The methodology has been proven
   useful to obtain, without perspective distortions, 3D thermograms even
   from non-radiometric raster images. The results also revealed that
   non-rectangular thermograms enable over 95\% of the 3D thermal data
   generated from IRT against rectangular shapes (over 85\%). Finally, the
   3D thermal data produced allow further thermal behaviour assessment,
   including calculating the object's heat loss and thermal transmittance
   for diverse applications such as energy audits, restoration, monitoring,
   or product quality control.},

Abstract = {This article mainly discussed the present application and development
   trend of the Building Information Model (BIM) in the field of
   architectural heritage management in China. BIM could create consistent
   relationship between geometric information and non-geometric properties
   in a building model, and had prominent technological characteristics
   such as design parameterization, data visualization, statistics
   automatization and work cooperation. So it not only could solve the
   problems of ``Information Silo{''} among the traditional databases and
   of ``Information Cutout{''} in the information managements, but also
   could provide a new development orientation for the Building Lifecycle
   Information Management (BLM) of architectural heritages in China. Now,
   as a new management technology, BIM should be developed in three aspects
   for BLM of architectural heritages: the customized development on
   specialization functions in the BIM software, information interchange
   among the different software, the interoperability managements on GIS
   and BIM.},

Abstract = {Digital building information is important during a building's lifecycle,
   it is needed from first design until demolition. The two domains that
   mainly contribute are AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction)
   during design, construction, and operation, and GIS as a supporting
   discipline for analysis and further integration of the building's
   environment. However, there is a challenge in information exchange
   between the two domains, resulting in the remodeling of digital building
   information in GIS. In this article, we identify three major data
   sources from the AEC domain and show transformation processes to enable
   the integration of such models into the geographical environment in the
   form of one transition model. Furthermore, we show that this model can
   either be used directly or exported in the form of de facto standards
   that allow for further analysis.},

Abstract = {A natural phenomenon often entails considerable consequences, such as
   the destruction of infrastructures and the loss of human lives. However,
   the number of casualties does not only depend on the severity of the
   natural phenomena but also on the effectiveness of the Urban Search And
   Rescue (USAR) operations, coordinated by the Operation Center (OC). The
   number of the incoming information is usually large, while the available
   USAR teams are limited, resulting in misleading decisions, regarding the
   prioritizing of the USAR operations, and huge delays. This
   ineffectiveness could result in a disproportionate number of casualties
   and decline the civilians' trust to the national and local government,
   producing political instability to the region or the country. Thus, an
   automated process, which prioritize the USAR operations is absolutely
   necessary, in order to ensure that the OC will take the best possible
   decisions in minimum time.
   In this study, a methodology is developed, regarding the production of
   prioritization maps (heatmaps), which identify and prioritize the most
   critical regions in an area prior to the occurrence of the natural
   disaster. At the time that the natural disaster occurs, their use from
   the OC, combined with the incoming information, will contribute to an
   effective and quick decision-making process, which in turn will minimize
   the casualties, and ensure the rapid return to normality and stability
   of the whole area. In order to develop this methodology several
   scenarios are taken into account, depending on the time and the day of
   the natural disaster and determining the most likely distribution of the
   population in the area under consideration. Statistical data (population
   and building data) and data of vulnerable social groups (eg disabled
   persons, children) are processed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
   to develop heatmaps.
   Finally, the previous described methodology has been applied for the
   municipality of Agia Paraskevi (a suburb of Athens), and the
   corresponding heatmaps are developed. The produced maps present the most
   critical areas of the municipality and their use, in a case of a natural
   disaster, is expected to enhance the effectiveness of USAR teams
   ensuring political stability. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation

Title = {Predicting long-term average concentrations of traffic-related air

Abstract = {Global regression models were developed to estimate individual levels of
   long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants. The models are
   based on data of a one-year measurement programme including geographic
   data on traffic and population densities. This investigation is part of
   a cohort study on the impact of traffic-related air pollution on
   respiratory health, conducted at the westerly end of the Ruhr-area in
   North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany.
   Concentrations of NO2, fine particle mass (PM2.5) and filter absorbance
   Of PM2.5 as a marker for soot were measured at 40 sites spread
   throughout the study region. Fourteen-day samples were taken between
   March 2002 and March 2003 for each season and site. Annual average
   concentrations for the sites were determined after adjustment for
   temporal variation.
   Information on traffic counts in major roads, building densities and
   community population figures were collected in a geographical
   information system (GIs). This information was used to calculate
   different potential traffic-based predictors: (a) daily traffic flow and
   maximum traffic intensity of buffers with radii from 50 to 10000m and
   (b) distances to main roads and highways.
   NO2 concentration and PM2.5 absorbance were strongly correlated with the
   traffic-based variables. Linear regression prediction models, which
   involved predictors with radii of 50 to 1000 m, were developed for the
   Wesel region where most of the cohort members lived. They reached a
   model fit (R-2) of 0.81 and 0.65 for NO2 and PM2.5 absorbance,
   respectively. Regression models for the whole area required larger
   spatial scales and reached R-2 = 0.90 and 0.82. Comparison of predicted
   values with NO2 measurements at independent public monitoring stations
   showed a satisfactory association (r = 0.66). PM2.5 concentration,
   however, was only slightly correlated and thus poorly predictable by
   traffic-based variables (r < 0.3).
   We concluded that NO2 and soot can be considered truly traffic-related
   pollutants, and that GIS-based regression models offer a promising
   approach to assess individual levels of exposure to these pollutants.

Abstract = {The mission of state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) has evolved,
   and their perception has shifted from focusing on constructing new
   assets to managing and maintaining existing transportation assets and
   optimizing asset performance. In response to this change, state DOTs
   began adopting a ``transportation asset management{''} approach, an
   intensive data-driven decision-making process to maintain and extend the
   serviceability of transportation assets throughout their lifecycle.
   However, state DOTs continue to face challenges in conducting
   cross-asset system analysis and integrating data across systems
   throughout the asset lifecycle. Conversely, emerging technologies,
   namely Digital Twins, have the potential to leverage the value of asset
   data and transform data into valuable insights to inform
   decision-making. The definition of Digital Twins in the infrastructure
   industry is inconsistent, and the transition toward a digitized built
   environment-a preliminary step required for a successful implementation
   of Digital Twins-has not been investigated. Thus, this paper presents
   the burning platform for the need for Digital Twins and defines the
   concept. Additionally, this study investigates the current practices of
   state DOTs toward the digital transition of their transportation asset
   data and contextualizes the DOTs' maturity in the advancement of digital
   processes. This paper focuses on ancillary asset systems, particularly
   Roadside, Electronic, and Drainage Asset systems. A web-based survey was
   developed and distributed to state DOTs for data collection. For each
   asset, the perceived timeline for digitization was investigated, and
   three variables related to data digitization were explored: data format,
   data level of detail, and data collection technique.},

Title = {4th generation district heating (4GDH) in developing countries:
   Low-temperature networks, prosumers and demand-side measures},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {295},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The aim is locating low-cost renovation measures to support the
   efficiency of district heating (DH). The topology analysis and GIS Zulu
   \& COPY; are applied for hydraulic simulation and to verify the scenario
   viability. The scenarios are compared by life cycle cost, levelized cost
   of heat (LCoH), capital and operational costs, energy production and
   consumption, network length, heat losses, linear heat density, heat pump
   usage, peak load reduction, nominal power duration or the equivalent
   full load time. As demand-side measures (DSM), improved control,
   thermostats with an indoor temperature sensor and variable frequency
   drive (VFD) pumps reduce heat demand. Prosumer scenario imply installing
   a base-load heat pump. It means a consumer no longer receives heat from
   the DH system, because the households are now adapted to lower space
   heating (SH) supply temperature. Prosumer concept also allows placing a
   heat pump on the DH return line. The simplest configuration includes
   only the booster heat pump and domestic hot water (DHW) tank storages
   enough to cover morning or evening consumption peak. To limit piping
   cost, only supply and return pipes are considered for low-temperature
   DH, no additional (service) pipes or mixing valves are assumed.
   Converting single-family houses to prosumers decreases energy
   consumption, primary network flows and temperatures. LCoH ranges
   19.7-35.4 EUR/MWh, depends on the decommissioned pipe length and its
   proportional pipe investment cost. LCoH decreases as the share of
   consumers converted to prosumers increases. Discounted payback time is
   10 years for DSM and 41 years for prosumer case. For a base-load heat
   pump, the payback time is much higher than the reference scenario. It
   implies the same share of heat losses (16\% of heat supplied from the
   CHP plant) with generally worse environmental and energy saving effect
   due to higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and higher consumption of
   primary energy. Energy production is expected to follow the pattern of
   the useful energy consumption to compensate heat losses. The effects are
   decreasing residential heat demand (-4\%), additional capacity to
   connect new consumers (+6\%) and decreasing the network length.},

   of Urban Digital Twins},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Solar radiation impacts diverse aspects of city life, such as harvesting
   energy with PV panels, passive heating of buildings in winter, cooling
   the loads of air-conditioning systems in summer, and the urban
   microclimate. Urban digital twins and 3D city models can support solar
   studies in the process of urban planning and provide valuable insights
   for data-driven decision support. This study examines the calculation of
   solar incident radiation at the city scale in Sofia using remote sensing
   data for the large shading context in a mountainous region and 3D
   building data. It aims to explore the methods of geometry optimisation,
   limitations, and performance issues of a 3D computer-aided design (CAD)
   tool dedicated to small-scale solar analysis and employed at the city
   scale. Two cases were considered at the city and district scales,
   respectively. The total face count of meshes for the simulations
   constituted approximately 2,000,000 faces. A total of 64,379 roofs for
   the whole city and 4796 buildings for one district were selected. All
   calculations were performed in one batch and visualised in a 3D web
   platform. The use of a 3D CAD environment establishes a seamless process
   of updating 3D models and simulations, while preprocessing in Geographic
   Information System (GIS) ensures working with large-scale datasets. The
   proposed method showed a moderate computation time for both cases and
   could be extended to include reflected radiation and dense
   photogrammetric meshes in the future.},

Abstract = {Rising floodwaters in the Blue Nile (BN) and White Nile (WN) tributaries
   continually affects people's lives and the safety of infrastructures in
   Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Recently, floods have covered a wide
   area of Khartoum and destroyed many buildings and bridges. We conducted
   this study to evaluate and predict the flood effects around BN and WN in
   Khartoum to make recommendations in view of upcoming flood disasters.
   Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes after floods that occurred in 2014,
   2016, and 2020 were evaluated and LULC was predicted for 2024 by
   applying a combination of remote sensing (RS) and geographic
   information-system (GIS) techniques. We also evaluated the expected
   hazard due to floods. Our results showed that the agricultural,
   built-up, and water changes around BN were 0.30\%, 0.25\%, and 0.05\%,
   respectively, for the period 2014-2016, and, that changes for the period
   2016-2020 were 3.38\%, 3.68\%, and 7.28\%, respectively.
   Correspondingly, the agricultural, built-up, and water changes around WN
   were 5.56\%, 3.26\%, and 8.02\% during 2014-2016 and 13.79\%, 5.62\%,
   and 21.40\% during 2016-2020. The change estimation indicates that the
   most flood effects in the region occurred around WN, possibly covering
   the whole areal extent of Khartoum city. The area covered by waterbodies
   may decrease by 4.18\% (BN) and 20.35\% (WN) during 2020-2024, based on
   RS-GIS evaluation, but hydraulic evaluation shows that the expected
   hazard due to floods in Khartoum is high. Thus, flood-risk assessments
   should take into account both physical hazard and the distribution of
   the population across the whole area of Khartoum.},

Abstract = {Waste from the construction sector poses huge challenges for sustainable
   waste management. This is not only due to the vast amount of waste
   produced in construction and demolition activities, but also due to
   pollutants potentially contained in these products. Subject to these
   conditions, waste management must ensure recovery of as many resources
   as possible, while making sure to keep material loops clean. This
   demanding task requires more knowledge about the existing building stock
   and an adaptation of current demolition processes. Innovative
   technologies, such as Building Information Modelling, or modern
   frameworks, such as Geographic Information Systems, offer a high
   potential to synoptically provide stock material information for future
   demolition activities for individual objects to be deconstructed as well
   as for whole cities as a basis for managing the anthropogenic stock and
   potential urban mining. Suitable methods of data collection allow for
   acquiring the desired input for the generation of building stock models
   enriched with demolition-related information. With the latter, selective
   deconstruction strategies as well as appropriate waste stream routing
   agendas can be planned and executed, thereby securing safety at work
   during the demolition process itself and a waste stream routing
   according to the waste hierarchy. This review article gives an overview
   of currently deployed building material assessment tools (data capture
   and visualisation), both a prerequisite for improved information on
   materials and geometry (and thereby mass/volume). In addition, this
   article describes workflows employable for the purpose of urban mining
   in end-of-life buildings, of which one holistic approach will be
   described in depth.},

Abstract = {Earthquakes are a sudden natural disaster that seriously endangers the
   safety of people's lives and property. Rapid and accurate assessment of
   earthquake disasters, especially the building damage assessment, is an
   effective way to reduce the risk of disasters. Compared with traditional
   methods of GIS-based building damage assessment, which takes the entire
   stricken region as a whole assessment area, lacks in considering the
   uneven space-time distribution of damage factors, the seismic spatial
   information grid (SSIG) method fully considers the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of seismic data and can give a more accurate and
   detailed assessment results. SSIG is an earthquake thematic spatial
   information grid, which has integrated numerous kinds of spatial
   information technology. In this paper, SSIG has been introduced into
   building damage assessments. It describes the model and method of
   building damage assessment based on SSIG. The proposed method was
   exemplified after the Yushu earthquake in Qinghai province of China. The
   case application shows that the SSIG-based method can get more accurate
   assessment results than single GIS-based method.},

Abstract = {The need for efficient and sustainable infrastructure - always critical
   to a city - is further gaining momentum as urbanisation creates the
   challenge of sustainably designing, constructing and operating the built
   environment. The AECOO industry, directly responsible for addressing
   this challenge, has adopted the use of BIM and GIS to aid in this
   endeavour. Both BIM and GIS overlap with respect to capturing aspects of
   the built environment, but are not interoperable by nature. To ensure a
   consistent and structured way of managing the information produced
   within these environments, industry standards such as IFC are
   implemented. Research to date focuses on addressing the integration
   between BIM and GIS for buildings by delving into the IFC and CityGML
   interoperability, which has highlighted significant geometric and
   semantic barriers that in the stage of integration, cannot be easily
   manoeuvred. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight regarding
   the information lifecycle during Design \& Construction in the HS2 Rail
   Infrastructure project and investigate the impact of current information
   management processes - and in particular Standards such as IFC, - on
   BIM-GIS interoperability and lifecycle management of an asset. Results
   demonstrate the levels of mis mapping during the export to IFC which
   varies depending on the infrastructure asset type. Discussion shows that
   these can be addressed by the introduction of additional semantic
   property sets to facilitate downstream BIM-GIS interoperability for O \&
   M, enabling scope for future work.},

Title = {Dynamics and Decoupling Analysis of Carbon Emissions from Construction
   Industry in China},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The construction industry is the backbone of most countries, but its
   carbon emissions are huge and growing rapidly, constraining the
   achievement of global carbon-peaking and carbon-neutrality goals.
   China's carbon emissions are the highest in the world, and the
   construction industry is the largest contributor. Due to significant
   differences between provinces in pressure, potential, and motivation to
   reduce emissions, the ``one-size-fits-all{''} emission reduction policy
   has failed to achieve the desired results. This paper empirically
   investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of carbon emissions in
   China's construction industry and their decoupling relationship with
   economic growth relying on GIS tools and decoupling model in an attempt
   to provide a basis for the formulation of differentiated construction
   emission reduction policies and plans in China. The study shows that,
   firstly, the changes in carbon emissions and carbon intensity in the
   provincial construction industry are becoming increasingly complex, with
   a variety of types emerging, such as declining, ``inverted U-shaped{''},
   growing, ``U-shaped{''}, and smooth fluctuating patterns. Secondly, the
   coefficient of variation is higher than 0.65 for a long time, indicating
   high spatial heterogeneity. However, spatial agglomeration and
   correlation are low, with only a few cluster-like agglomerations formed
   in the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, Bohai Bay, Northeast
   China, and Loess and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau regions. Thirdly, most
   provinces have not reached peak carbon emissions from the construction
   industry, with 25\% having reached peak and being in the plateau stage,
   respectively. Fourthly, the decoupling relationship between carbon
   emissions from the construction industry and economic growth, as well as
   their changes, is increasingly diversified, and most provinces are in a
   strong and weak decoupling state. Moreover, a growing number of
   provinces that have achieved decoupling are moving backward to
   re-coupling, due to the impact of economic transformation and the
   outbreaks of COVID-19, with the degraded regions increasingly
   concentrated in the northeast and northwest. Fifthly, we classify
   China's 30 provinces into Leader, Intermediate, and Laggard policy zones
   and further propose differentiated response strategies. In conclusion,
   studying the trends and patterns of carbon-emission changes in the
   construction industry in different regions, revealing their spatial
   differentiation and correlation, and developing a classification
   management strategy for low carbonized development of the construction
   industry help significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and
   self-adaptability of policy design and implementation.},

Abstract = {In the field of AEC/FM, BIM has been recognized by industrial and
   political actors as a powerful tool for resolving data interoperability
   problems. Coupled with cloud computing and GIS, BIM would allow
   integrating different information exchange standard into one single
   digital building model that can be real-time edited by several
   stakeholders or architects. In this paper, we examine the benefits
   brought by using Semantic Web technologies in delivering such universal
   building model. We present how our approach is a step further in
   reaching the vision of BIM, and how it can serve construction process,
   operation and maintenance, along with facilities' lifecycle management.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine how CAMA, GIS and Remote Sensing are
   integrated to assist property taxation. Real property tax apart from its
   fiscal dimension is directly linked to geographic location. The value of
   the land and other immovable features such as buildings and structures
   is determined from specific parameters. All these immovable assets are
   visible and have specific geographic location \& coordinates, materials,
   occupied area, land-use \& utility, ownership \& occupancy status and
   finally a specific value (ad valorem property taxation system) according
   to which the property tax is levied to taxpayers. Of high importance in
   the tax imposing procedure is that the use of CAMA, GIS and Remote
   Sensing tools is capable of providing effective and efficient collection
   of this property value determining data. Furthermore, these tools can
   track changes during a property's lifecycle such parcel subdivision into
   plots, demolition of a building and development of a new one or track a
   change in the planning zone. The integration of these systems also
   supports a full range of business processes on revenue mobilization
   ranging from billing to taxpayers objections management.},

   (GeoKG) quality assessment},
Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 21},
Abstract = {High-quality Geographic Knowledge Graphs (GeoKGs) are highly anticipated
   for their potential to provide reliable semantic support in geographical
   knowledge reasoning, training Geographic Large Language Models
   (Geo-LLMs), enabling geographical recommendation, and facilitating
   various geospatial knowledge-driven tasks. However, there is a lack of a
   standardized quality assessment methodology and clearly defined
   evaluative indicators in the field of GeoKGs research. This research
   uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to conduct a systematic review of
   literature and standards in the field of GeoKG in an effort to fill the
   gap. First, using the lifecycle theory as a guide, we outline and
   propose five groups including twenty assessment criteria and their
   accompanying calculation techniques for evaluating GeoKG quality. Then,
   expanding on this foundation, we present a streamlined evaluation scheme
   for GeoKGs that relies on just seven key measures, discussing their
   applicability, utility, and weight scheme in greater detail. After
   applying the GeoKG quality framework, we stated three key tasks emerge
   as priorities: the creation of specialized assessment tools, the
   formation of worldwide standards, and the building of large-scale,
   high-quality GeoKGs. We believe this thorough and systematic GeoKG
   quality assessment technique will help construct high-quality GeoKGs and
   promote GeoKGs as an engine for geo-intelligence applications including
   Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) systems, Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) analyzers, and Virtual Geographic Environments
   (VGEs) models.},

Abstract = {Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is being used more often today as a water
   supply and stormwater management green infrastructure (GI). In recent
   years, GIs in urban water engineering have gained attention due to their
   lower lifecycle costs-in both implementation and operation phases-rather
   than traditional gray approaches. The research described in the present
   paper compared implementation of RWH systems to gray approaches
   previously designed as a part of the long-term control plan (LTCP) for
   combined sewer overflow (CSO) control in Toledo, Ohio. RWH scenarios in
   this study were defined based on different system capacities and release
   policies, and then combined gray and green scenarios were analyzed
   according to their hydrologic performance and cost. This study employed
   long-term continuous hydrologic and hydraulic (H\&H) simulations as well
   as lifecycle cost (LCC) analysis techniques. The results showed that
   greening the LTCP via RWH could improve the lifecycle cost-effectiveness
   by 48\%. The captured rainwater was considered to supply toilet flushing
   water demand in buildings. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Potential of Virtual Design Construction Technologies to Improve
   Job-Site Safety in Gulf Corporation Council},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the advancement of digital design practices in the global
   construction industry, different aspects related to the project
   lifecycle are extracting their benefits, including making improvements
   in safety. The objective of this paper is to ascertain the awareness of
   these technologies, their potential, and any barriers related to the use
   of different virtual design construction (VDC) tools, such as building
   information modeling, virtual reality, augmented reality, and geographic
   information systems, to improve job-site safety in Gulf Cooperation
   Council (GCC) countries. The paper presents an overview of the GCC
   construction industry and highlights current safety management practices
   and problems in the region. The potential of VDC tools for improving
   job-site safety is discussed and presented. The study has used a
   questionnaire survey to identify the drivers and barriers of using VDC
   tools in improving job-site safety management in the GCC region. The
   results indicated that ``designing emergency and evacuation plans{''}
   and ``fall-hazard prevention strategies{''} are the two best safety
   applications of these tools if used proactively. Similarly, ``lack of
   knowledge about return on investment for VDC tools{''} was considered as
   the predominant barrier, preventing stakeholders from using these
   technologies to improve construction safety. These results will help the
   GCC construction industry to build a strategy for the digitalization of
   proactive constructability analysis techniques for improving job-site
   safety. Overall, due to the multilingual dynamics of this region, it is
   recommended that VDC tools should become more prevalent so that the
   transfer of safety information and hazard prevention becomes easier,
   mitigating safety risks.},

Title = {Butterfly species richness in the north-west Mediterranean Basin:: the
   role of natural and human-induced factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {905-915},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim We developed a model enabling us to evaluate the contribution of
   both natural and human-related factors to butterfly species richness in
   Catalonia, a Mediterranean area that harbours one of the most diverse
   butterfly faunas in Europe.
   Location The study was carried out in Catalonia (north-east Iberian
   Peninsula), a region of 31,930 km(2) lying between the Pyrenees, the
   Ebro depression and the Mediterranean sea.
   Methods Data from the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme were used to
   assess butterfly species richness from 55 transects spread all over the
   region. Three groups of environmental variables likely to affect the
   presence of butterfly species were calculated, above all from geographic
   information system data: (1) climatology and topography, (2) vegetation
   structure and (3) human disturbance. Because climatic and topographic
   variables are expected to be strongly correlated, we first performed a
   principal component analysis (PCA) to create a summarizing factor that
   would account for most of the variance within this set of variables.
   Subsequently, a backward stepwise multiple regression was performed in
   order to assess the effects of environmental factors on butterfly
   species richness.
   Results A total of 131 species were detected in the monitoring
   transects, representing 75.7\% of the butterfly fauna known from
   Catalonia. Mean species richness per transect and per year was 41.4,
   although values varied greatly among sites (range: 14-76.8). The final
   regression model explained more than 80\% of the total variance, which
   indicated a strong association between butterfly species richness and
   the studied environmental factors. The model revealed the very important
   contribution of climatic and topographic variables, which were combined
   into a single factor in the PCA. In contrast to what has been found in
   other, more northerly countries, species richness was negatively
   correlated with temperature and positively correlated with rainfall,
   except for extreme cold and wet conditions. This may be a consequence of
   the predictably adverse effects of the Mediterranean summer drought on
   herbivorous insects, and the fact that the limits of distribution of
   many butterflies correlate well with climatic variables. Human
   disturbance (defined as the proportion of urban and agricultural
   landscape cover in buffer areas of 5 km around the transect sites) was
   the second most important predictor for species richness. We found that
   a significant decrease in species numbers was associated with an
   increase in human pressure, a finding that indicates that not only
   building development, but also modern-day agricultural practices are
   detrimental to the conservation of Mediterranean butterflies.
   Surprisingly, vegetation variables had an almost negligible effect on
   butterfly species richness.
   Main conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the current motors
   of global change will have a negative effect on Mediterranean butterfly
   assemblages. First, changes in land-use are transforming and fragmenting
   the landscape into an inhospitable and less permeable matrix for
   butterflies. Secondly, the negative correlation between species richness
   and temperature will lead to a predictable loss of diversity over the
   coming years, as predicted in the most plausible scenarios of climate
   change. Considering the high butterfly richness characterizing the
   Mediterranean Basin, this future trend will pose a serious threat to
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Green area loss in San Juan's inner-ring suburban neighborhoods: a
   multidisciplinary approach to analyzing green/gray area dynamics},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The loss of green areas and vegetation in suburban neighborhoods poses
   short-and long-term consequences associated with environmental changes
   and socioeconomic decline that can propel such developments to an
   unsustainable state. We summarize an interdisciplinary investigation
   aimed at identifying the drivers of green area loss, green cover loss,
   and quantifying the impact on three inner-ring suburban neighborhoods
   located along the Rio Piedras watershed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. An
   inductive approach to social-ecological research was undertaken because
   it provides a flexible platform for interdisciplinary collaboration on
   this complex and dynamic subject. The three developments selected for
   the study were constructed in the mid-20th century under paradigms of
   modernity that included providing conditions for a better and more
   dignified way of living, among which green areas played a central role.
   The green area change analysis was undertaken first, by way of using
   building footprint growth as a proxy, which represents a minimal
   estimate of change, and transferring the information from aerial
   photographs, original development plans, construction drawings, and GIS
   maps to AutoCAD to quantify building footprint change for each
   neighborhood. The period of analysis started from the time of the
   construction of each development to the year 2010. The second estimation
   was performed using orthorectified infrared aerial imagery to quantify
   green cover in year 2008 and contrast that information with the
   conditions at the time the developments were constructed. Green-gray
   area dynamics were thus analyzed together with longitudinal
   socioeconomic data to help in the assessment of effects. The
   investigation revealed long-term socioeconomic declining trends in two
   of the neighborhoods, weak governance of the built environment,
   substantial increase in automobile ownership, and distinct
   physical-spatial characteristics as drivers behind the changes observed.
   The complexity and variety of exogenous and endogenous factors that have
   been identified in this study as affecting private and public inner-ring
   suburban green areas reveals dynamic and spatially differentiated
   concomitant processes and suggests that these are conditioned by the
   socioeconomic trajectories of each neighborhood and by larger
   metropolitan scale socioeconomic and technological trends. Lower income
   neighborhoods reflect a tendency for socioeconomic decline and greater
   loss of green areas and vegetation cover in time, thus suggesting
   policies geared toward adaptive governance. In contrast, the upper
   income neighborhood exhibits a more stable socioeconomic trajectory and
   less significant green area loss as well as increase in vegetation
   cover. Three hypotheses are posited for future sampling increments and
   testing. The findings and literature on urban economics and the decline
   of inner-ring suburbs in the U. S. suggest the need for policy geared to
   sustainable urban redevelopment as a strategy for adaptive governance.
   The competing needs for land by higher density uses and by green areas
   in sustainable redevelopment initiatives requires a trade-off analysis
   in which a thorough account of costs and benefits is warranted. As such,
   sound data as that presented in this paper will aid urban ecological
   design in the process of achieving sustainable and environmentally sound
   land-use adaptations that seek to recuperate green areas' environmental
   services in urban and suburban contexts.},

Title = {Analysis and GIS Mapping of Flooding Hazards on 10 May 2016, Guangzhou,
   China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {On 10 May 2016, Guangdong Province, China, suffered a heavy rainstorm.
   This rainstorm flooded the whole city of Guangzhou. More than 100,000
   people were affected by the flooding, in which eight people lost their
   lives. Subway stations, cars, and buses were submerged. In order to
   analyse the influential factors of this flooding, topographical
   characteristics were mapped using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) by the
   Geographical Information System (GIS) and meteorological conditions were
   statistically summarised at both the whole city level and the district
   level. To analyse the relationship between flood risk and urbanization,
   GIS was also adopted to map the effect of the subway system using the
   Multiple Buffer operator over the flooding distribution area. Based on
   the analyses, one of the significant influential factors of flooding was
   identified as the urbanization degree, e.g., construction of a subway
   system, which forms along flood-prone areas. The total economic loss due
   to flooding in city centers with high urbanization has become very
   serious. Based on the analyses, the traditional standard of severity of
   flooding hazards (rainfall intensity grade) was modified. Rainfall
   intensity for severity flooding was decreased from 50 mm to 30 mm in
   urbanized city centers. In order to protect cities from flooding, a
   ``Sponge City{''} planning approach is recommended to increase the
   temporary water storage capacity during heavy rainstorms. In addition,
   for future city management, the combined use of GIS and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) is recommended to evaluate flooding hazards.},

Title = {GIS-Based Information System for Automated Building Facade Assessment
   Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular in building
   facade inspections to maintain a safe and well-performed built
   environment. A camera-equipped UAV system can capture numerous
   high-resolution facade images for close-up visual inspections. However,
   in several cases, the multispectrum and spatiotemporal data collected by
   UAVs are not systematically documented and utilized, which obstructs the
   automation in the identification, localization, assessment, and tracking
   of facade anomalies. This paper develops an integrated, computational
   GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval,
   detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on
   UAV-captured data. The developed system creates user-friendly access to
   diverse professional imagery analysis tools from external artificial
   intelligence (AI) algorithms. A real-world case was studied to present
   the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of
   multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As
   a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion,
   processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection

   Therefore, this paper elaborates on a platform demonstrating the
   potential of combining big data for main corridor in Old Balad by using
   GIS server; In addition to people reflections within outdoor spaces via
   smart sensors while experiencing the variety of urban features of the
   area. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to give an overview of people
   responsiveness, as well as surveying and representation of spacious data
   in order to support the process of further integration between HBIM and
   GIS tools to maximize the use of built heritage resources used for
   creating, conserving, documenting, and managing information which has a
   great impact on touristic and commercial activities within the case of

Abstract = {The AEC industry is facing constant demand for resources, excessive raw
   materials' consumption, and waste generation. Now, the construction
   industry is responsible for about 50\% of the global solid waste, which
   negatively impacts the environment. However, construction techniques and
   building practices have been advanced over the years with an increased
   interest in sustainability, especially in energy conservation and in
   adopting the Industrial Production layer of Construction 4.0 (i.e.,
   modular prefabrication, 3D concrete printing, and BIM). The concept of
   circular economy (CE) has also been identified as a potential solution
   to achieve sustainability in building construction through the design,
   construction, and deconstruction processes that enhance waste management
   based on the framework that is related to reducing, reusing, and
   recycling. Additionally, geospatial data complements advanced digital
   technologies by providing a collaborative platform that supports CE as a
   practical approach to sustainability. Thus, this study will provide a
   straightforward methodology for developing a BIM-GIS sustainable design
   model that integrates circular economy's concept to enhance construction
   sustainability in order to minimize lifecycle waste based on various
   construction methods (i.e., conventional, modular, and 3D printing). The
   proposed model integrates tools and data for the evaluation and planning
   of construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) management strategies at
   the design stage, including quantifying the wasted materials, selecting
   the waste handling equipment, and estimating the associated costs with
   the loading and hauling of waste at the various stages of a project. The
   proposed model will provide designers with the ability to evaluate the
   construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) during the design of
   buildings based on their different construction methods at the early
   stage of design using the design for deconstruction (DfD) concept;
   sustainable construction methods; and deconstruction process for waste
   management, which will lead to a suitable construction method.},

Title = {Blockchain-Enabled City Information Modeling Framework for Urban Asset
   Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Object-based modeling has become an integral and more preferred design
   approach as against two-dimensional (2D) design representation. This is
   evident in the increased use of building information modeling (BIM) for
   building design and city information modeling (CIM) for city planning
   and development. However, the development and management of object-based
   city models are often siloed and do not coexist in a virtual
   environment. Urban infrastructure is often designed in isolation, yet it
   forms part of an integrated network of assets in real life. Blockchain
   is one of several technologies that has been integrated with BIM because
   of its transparent and tamper-proof features. This research proposes a
   framework for the lifecycle management of buildings and other urban
   assets by integrating blockchain technology (BCT) into a heterogenous
   CIM of multiowned assets using a nested, multilevel data environment.
   First, the BIM is synchronized into a GIS scene for geospecificity, then
   the BIM metadata is written onto a blockchain protocol distributing the
   model information across a network of project collaborators using a
   common data environment (CDE). The resultant CIM is then shared through
   an outer layered city level CDE. Use case scenarios are presented to
   validate the functionality of the proposed approach, and research
   limitations are discussed. The framework enables the critical
   interproject or interasset communication which is otherwise impossible
   in traditional approaches where individual assets are designed as
   stand-alone models.
   Nowadays, nearly every physical product pre-exists in digital form for
   purposes of design, testing, and optimizing the product before its
   creation. This research argues that the city can also exist in digital
   form beyond a mere representation of its geometry, but encompassing the
   intangible information flow that exists between physical assets in real
   cities. This study proposes using City Information Modeling (CIM) that
   is enabled through blockchain technology (BCT) to record all activities
   concerning physical assets throughout their lifecycle. This is achieved
   by harnessing the various digital models that predate the physical
   components of the city from their design stages. These records of
   activities are retrievable and easily visualized interactively. Such CIM
   models are useful to trace the origins of building parts for accurate
   asset valuation or to review the maintenance services carried out on an
   asset and its impact on the constituent parts. It also provides a real
   template to commence new design projects whereby existing surrounding
   features, which are only possible through a site visit, can now be
   considered. The study takes into consideration the multiple ownership
   structure of city assets by integrating various digital models.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {To adapt to the ``fine{''} and ``extensive{''} management
   characteristics of railway signal equipment operation and maintenance,
   achieving real-time and interactive monitoring of signal equipment
   operation status, and developing an integrated approach to equipment
   operation and maintenance, this paper takes a comprehensive management
   perspective. To create a lightweight BIM model, the Garland folding
   algorithm is utilized to simplify the IFC file format. Building on this
   approach, the data are divided based on building component division
   standards to obtain separate files containing geometric information and
   semantic attributes. The geometric information files are converted to a
   3D Tiles format, combining BIM semantic attributes with semantic
   attribute files through an intermediate format. Dynamic data management
   is achieved by setting the octree space index structure in combination
   with a view-frustum culling algorithm. Then, the 3D Tiles target file is
   imported into the Cesium platform, and Node.js is used to achieve
   three-dimensional visualization of railway signal operation and
   maintenance. The proposed method is verified using an inbound signal as
   an example to assess its feasibility. The results demonstrate the
   potential of the proposed method to achieve stable integration between
   BIM equipment full lifecycle maintenance and GIS geographical space
   display. Railway signal equipment is endowed with comprehensive
   one-click information query functions for equipment positioning and
   spatial analysis, improving the efficiency and scientific
   decision-making level of equipment operation and maintenance.},

Abstract = {The challenge is to decide how to design a building information model
   (BIM) to support building maintenance and development for existing
   buildings. Until now the main BIM focus has been related to new
   projects, and this study focus on different challenges when deciding to
   use BIM for both new and existing buildings. This paper is based on
   studies together with regional and hospital authorities, but should be
   relevant for other types of existing buildings as well.
   The primary objectives of these studies are to implement requirements
   for fire safety, universal design, environmental regulations, status of
   maintenances, occupancy, daily operations, rebuilding, mechanical,
   electrical, and plumbing installations (MEP) and effective use of energy
   and space within the BIM model. Additionally, these studies consider
   what BIM competence is required and by whom. It must also be decided
   which information is necessary for operating different types of
   building, and which information must be kept up to date. Successful BIM
   adoption needs a good implementation strategy, professional guidelines
   and motivated people in the organisation.
   This paper explains important options and decisions necessary to
   establish a BIM for management of existing buildings. Central questions
   concern the need for competence at different levels in the building
   owner organisations. At the same time the paper considers how the
   organisational structures may need to be adjusted.},

Abstract = {Since several years, the concept of the ``Smart City{''} has been
   meeting a large concern throughout the world. Through smart city
   implementation, cities aim at improving the efficiency and security of
   their urban infrastructures as well as the quality of life of citizens.
   The Smart City concept is based on collection and analysis of data
   concerning the urban built environment (buildings and infrastructures)
   as well as the natural environment and urban services. Since built
   environment plays a major role in the city functioning and the quality
   of services, a smart city project should integrate this environment in
   the heart of its strategy. This integration requires first the
   development of digital modelling for the City, urban infrastructures and
   buildings. The digital modeling should include the asset data, the
   operating data and the environmental data all over the lifecycle of
   concerned systems. It should also guarantee the interoperability between
   the different modelling tools. This paper presents a synthesis of min
   tools used for modelling the City, urban infrastructures and buildings
   and discusses their interoperability.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of smart hydropower, the application of
   visualization integration technology based on BIM and WebGIS in the
   entire lifecycle of engineering is increasing year by year. The
   traditional static information based management model can no longer meet
   the growing management needs of engineering. Therefore, this study first
   focuses on building a refined BIM 3D model using BIM technology, and
   implements the extension and integration of missing dynamic monitoring
   information in the original BIM based on the universal IFC format. Then,
   based on the WebGL open-source framework for 3D GIS, Cesium serves as
   the basic platform for WebGIS, expanding the depth of BIM related data
   by integrating IoT and mobile internet technologies, and achieving
   unified management and visual display of massive multi-source
   information. The generated dynamic monitoring BIM can effectively solve
   the problems of scattered data management and low visualization level in
   traditional management processes, thereby assisting managers in
   intuitively and clearly judging the operation status of the project and
   quickly and accurately grasping various information of the project
   operation. It provides a set of visualization integration technology for
   the development of a full lifecycle integration platform.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The former residences of historical figures are typical
   landscape elements of historic districts, which are characterised by the
   styles of these residences and spiritual historical figures cultures.
   The purpose of this paper is to determine how the former residences
   respond once the historical figures living there have passed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The history of human culture and
   progression of urban construction which are submerged in societal
   transformation - is recorded for old Beijing city. Narrative space
   theory is used and methods such as a content analysis, map overlay and
   the Geographic Information System are employed to analyse the selected
   300 former residences of historical figures in old Beijing city.
   Findings - The results are as follows: the political setting played a
   key role in the evolution process, three political narrative areas in
   the inner city and one cultural narrative area in the outer city form
   the narrative spatial structure of the former residences of historical
   figures, ``government construction{''} and ``resident construction{''}
   are the main reasons for the loss and destruction of narrative spaces
   and ordinary life is an important channel for showcasing the history of
   former residences. The narrative spaces of these residences carry double
   histories, namely, the development of human history and of city
   construction.
   Originality/value - Different from former studies that focus on the
   preservation of the single historical building, this study explores the
   integral logic of historic buildings in the whole city through narrative
   space theory to get a combination of culture and space.},

Abstract = {Architectural Heritage is a strong witness to a people's history that
   symbolizes their identity. The Old city of Jerusalem, and as a UNESCO
   world heritage site(1) is a living city especially with its great wealth
   of historic structures, including places of worships for the three
   monotheistic religions, significant monuments, and whole historical
   residential neighbourhoods, Figure 1.
   In spite of the prevailing political conditions, difficulties that
   Palestinians encounter in Jerusalem, and the demands of the modern life
   and ever-growing population, several attempts had been stimulated to
   protect this Heritage. A specialized program (Old City of Jerusalem
   Revitalization Program - OCJRP) has been working since 1994. The program
   was established by the Welfare Association(2) to help protect
   Jerusalem's cultural heritage applying international conventions and the
   highest professional standards for the direct benefit of residents,
   building users and visitors to the Old City as well as for future
   generations.
   This paper aims to describe the various activities and main findings
   carried out by the Technical Office of OCJRP - in the last twenty years
   as well as stressing on problems encountered by the team. It will rely
   on the team experience accumulated during the implementation of the
   projects, the research, surveys and studies undertaken by the team who
   helped in the creation of the database and its ongoing process.

Abstract = {The transformation of the built environment requires more and more
   frequently the use of an intelligent management system that is able to
   offer multiple and simultaneous responses on the issues about the
   quality life of modern citizens : Economy, People, Mobility, Governance,
   Environment and Living.
   This paper pointes out some results of a research aimed to highlight,
   through the comparison of international experiences, the adaptability of
   smartness concept to a Mediterranean context area characterized by a
   great cultural value. There are several models of reference : some
   examples of sustainable neighborhoods in Europe, the smart street and
   the smart building in Northern Europe and the Action Plan of Copenhagen,
   Vancouver and London.
   The results achieved from the systematizing of these different study
   cases shows how the concept of smartness applied to the urban context
   isn't inclined to assert itself as a template to be replicated in a
   serial manner in all geographic areas.
   However, it is possible in every urban reality read the specifics of the
   area in terms of strengths and weaknesses; aim at the creation of
   networked integrative superstructures; focus the propulsion nodal
   centers of growth and ensure the continuity of the system through the
   collection of data and information used in short, medium and long term.
   In this sense Smart City is an opportunity for the city as a whole.
   Besides the tantalizing prospect of the access to funding available for
   the public authorities, it represents a real opportunity to open up to
   international experiences becoming the protagonist of the
   transformation.},

Abstract = {In the context of big data and the Internet of Things, with the
   advancement of geospatial data acquisition and retrieval, the volume of
   available geospatial data is increasing every minute. Thus, new
   data-management architecture is needed. We proposed a building
   information model (BIM) big data-storage-management solution with hybrid
   storage architecture based on web virtual reality geographical
   information system (WebVRGIS). BIM is associated with the integration of
   spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban
   building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution
   characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and
   management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The
   architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language
   (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of
   the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform
   as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that
   the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower
   response time compared to the traditional relational database in
   geospatial big data searches. The integration and fusion of BIM big data
   in WebVRGIS realizes a revolutionary transformation of city information
   management during a full lifecycle. The system also has great promise
   for the storage of other geospatial big data, such as traffic data.},

Title = {Loss estimation in Istanbul based on deterministic earthquake scenarios

Abstract = {The rapid urban development in Istanbul has lead to an increase in the
   exposure levels of the urban vulnerability. Due to the steadily
   increasing population, with improper land-use planning, inappropriate
   construction techniques and inadequate infrastructure systems,
   associated with an existing high hazard level, Istanbul is one of the
   most risky cities in the Mediterranean region. Estimations of casualties
   and losses, expected for given earthquake scenarios, are necessary to
   develop sustainable rehabilitation programs and for improving
   preparedness. Deterministic hazard scenarios and time-dependent
   probabilistic hazard assessment were used as input to a GIS-based loss
   estimation model, to evaluate the earthquake risk for Istanbul.
   The deterministic ground shaking scenarios, used for loss estimation in
   Istanbul were defined in, terms of acceleration and velocity time series
   for recognized reference earthquakes caused by different rupture models
   along extended sources. The ground motions were calculated for the whole
   metropolitan area extending over a grid system of 25 x 100km(2).
   For the case of Istanbul, the representative scenario was selected by
   comparing the simulated peak values and response spectra with the
   empirical ground motion models available for the area. Simulated values
   are within one standard deviation of the empirical regressions.
   The availability of wide-ranging building inventory data allowed the
   application of a GIS-based loss estimation model (KoeriLoss-V2) to
   evaluate different loss scenarios depending on the ground shaking input,
   as well as to consider the implications of mitigation actions. It was
   found that 30\% of the buildings in the metropolitan area may be in need
   of either strengthening or demolition to achieve an adequate degree of
   life safety. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Landslides are widespread phenomena that occur in any terrestrial area
   with slopes, causing massive property damage and, in the worst-case
   scenario, loss of human life. This propensity to suffer losses is
   particularly high for developing countries due to their urban
   development, population growth and drastic land use changes. Social and
   economic consequences of landslides can be reduced through detailed
   planning and management strategies, which can be aided by risk analysis.
   In this study, we performed a detailed quantitative risk analysis for
   landslides in the whole of Central Asia (4 000 000 km 2 ).
   Landslide-induced risk was computed, using a 200 m spatial resolution,
   in terms of exposed population and expected economic losses to buildings
   and linear infrastructures (roads and railways). The purpose of our
   study is to produce the first regional-scale landslide risk assessment
   for Central Asia in order to inform regional-scale risk mitigation
   strategies, and it represents an advanced step in the landslide risk
   analysis for extremely broad areas.},

Title = {Assessing Accessibility and Social Equity of Tertiary Hospitals for
   Older Adults: A City-Wide Study of Tianjin, China},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building age-friendly cities with good accessibility and social equity
   can help improve older adults' well-being and quality of life. However,
   current accessibility analysis of service facilities tends to target
   most general users, while few studies have been conducted regarding
   hospitals from an age-friendly perspective. This study aims to measure
   accessibility to tertiary hospitals and conduct its equity analysis for
   older adults aged 65 years or over. First, the gravity-based model and
   geographic information system are utilized to measure accessibility to
   tertiary hospitals within regions and across regions, and the overall
   accessibility of a region. Second, coefficient of variation and global
   Moran's I are adopted to investigate differences in accessibility to
   tertiary hospitals by type among regions. Third, Lorenz curves and Gini
   coefficients are employed to analyze social equity of access to medical
   services for the elderly. Taking Tianjin, China as the case study, the
   results show that there exist spatial clusters in terms of accessibility
   to tertiary hospitals within districts, across districts, and of the
   whole district. Most districts in the city center have better access to
   these hospitals than the peripheral and suburban districts. The social
   equity of accessibility to tertiary hospitals is slightly better in the
   senior population than in the total population. This study can help the
   governments improve the spatial distribution and allocation of urban
   health care resources in a more equitable manner and promote the
   development of age-friendly cities in future.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is a striking development
   in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, which
   provides in-depth information on different stages of the building
   lifecycle. Real estate valuation, as a fully interconnected field with
   the AEC industry, can benefit from 3D technical achievements in BIM
   technologies. Some studies have attempted to use BIM for real estate
   valuation procedures. However, there is still a limited understanding of
   appropriate mechanisms to utilize BIM for valuation purposes and the
   consequent impact that BIM can have on decreasing the existing
   uncertainties in the valuation methods. Therefore, the paper aims to
   analyze the literature on BIM for real estate valuation practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a systematic review to
   analyze existing utilizations of BIM for real estate valuation
   practices, discovers the challenges, limitations and gaps of the current
   applications and presents potential domains for future investigations.
   Research was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar
   databases to find relevant references that could contribute to the
   study. A total of 52 publications including journal papers, conference
   papers and proceedings, book chapters and PhD and master's theses were
   identified and thoroughly reviewed. There was no limitation on the
   starting date of research, but the end date was May 2022. Findings -
   Four domains of application have been identified: (1) developing machine
   learning-based valuation models using the variables that could directly
   be captured through BIM and industry foundation classes (IFC) data
   instances of building objects and their attributes; (2) evaluating the
   capacity of 3D factors extractable from BIM and 3D GIS in increasing the
   accuracy of existing valuation models; (3) employing BIM for accurate
   estimation of components of cost approach-based valuation practices; and
   (4) extraction of useful visual features for real estate valuation from
   BIM representations instead of 2D images through deep learning and
   computer vision. Originality/value - This paper contributes to research
   efforts on utilization of 3D modeling in real estate valuation
   practices. In this regard, this paper presents a broad overview of the
   current applications of BIM for valuation procedures and provides
   potential ways forward for future investigations.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has emerged as a transformative
   force in the construction industry, gaining traction within the
   hydropower sector. This study critically examines the adoption and
   application of BIM throughout the entire lifecycle of hydropower
   projects, addressing a notable gap in existing research, to encompass a
   holistic approach to the management and resilience of these critical
   infrastructures. The objective is to delineate the comprehensive range
   of BIM applications, use cases, and adoption, integrating technologies
   including Digital Twin, UAV, GIS, and simulation tools, across
   components of hydropower projects. Employing a systematic search paired
   with a critical review of the selected literature, this study
   meticulously evaluates significant contributions in this domain. Through
   thematic analysis, the multifaceted utility of BIM in hydropower
   structures, including an in-depth evaluation of its current adoption
   within the industry, is presented. This encompasses an analysis of both
   benefits and challenges inherent in BIM implementation for hydropower
   infrastructures. This study is a significant contribution to
   understanding how BIM can be leveraged to enhance the resilience of
   hydropower infrastructures. It provides a comprehensive view of BIM's
   applications, challenges, and future potential, guiding stakeholders in
   adopting strategies that ensure these structures withstand, adapt, and
   recover from disruptions while maintaining sustainable and efficient
   operations.},

Abstract = {In order To mitigate the adverse consequences of an earthquake,
   determining the vulnerability of buildings is imperative and crucial for
   saving human lives and buildings. So far, a good review / assessment of
   the RISK-EU method appears, as opposite to the other methods (more than
   a dozen) vulnerability assessment methods, to be by far the most
   suitable and applicable to the Context and seismographic configuration
   of Algeria, This tentative case study will review and evaluate, in
   particular, the RISK-EU method for Arzew city with due consideration to
   the following parameters:
   . Geographical position: North West of Algeria
   . Classified in Zone II, average seismicity area, in accordance with the
   Algerian seismic Rule-RPA99 version 2003-
   .The city suffered several earthquakes, the most recent one happened
   last Mars 21th, 2014 (Ms=4.3; equivalent to VI approximate to VII as per
   EMS 98),
   . The whole town is sitting on the rim between two tectonic plates and
   next to the Mediterranean Sea grand rifts This study is based on the
   results of a survey assessing the exposure of the Arzew city buildings
   with a cross check and comparison with results obtained through the use
   of another method, widely used in Algeria, named CTC. This latter method
   is based on the assessment of the extent of the damages.
   For clarity sake and better understanding of our results, we have
   included in this study a seismic risk map Such map has been developed
   using a SIG method (Geographical information system)
   This study contains proposals to enhance the protection of the Arzew
   city buildings and reduce the overall risk and exposure to the frequent
   seismic activity in the Mediterranean area. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {Flood hazard of the Somma-Vesuvius region based on historical (19-20th
   century) and geomorphological data},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {56},

Abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary susceptibility map of the flood hazard
   for the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic district, worked out by means of
   multi-disciplinary historical, geological, geomorphological and rainfall
   data processing. It is well known that the Somma-Vesuvius volcano, due
   to its explosive volcanism and the dense urbanization of the surrounding
   area, with a population exceeding 650,000 is one of the most dangerous
   active volcanoes of the world. Although this area has been extensively
   studied from the volcanological point of view with regards to its
   volcanic hazard, there are currently not many detailed studies about its
   flood hazard factors, despite the fact that, in the last century, many
   intense rainfall events in this area have produced several floods that
   invaded the surrounding plains affecting towns and roads, and causing
   much damages and loss of lives. Accordingly, in this paper
   high-resolution DEM (5x5 m pixel) and detailed geomorphological maps of
   the whole area have been analyzed and processed in GIS environment,
   carrying out a comparative study of the present-day morphology and the
   morphology of the 1900's volcanic edifice, including changes of
   infrastructures and buildings throughout the last century. These
   results, together with historical chronicles data and the rainfall
   accurate data for all flood events, have been processed in this paper
   for highlighting the drainage basins areas of Somma-Vesuvius where the
   flood phenomena could be more probable in the future, working out a
   preliminary zoning map, also suggesting in which sectors interventions
   useful for mitigation of flood risk should be implemented.},

Title = {Protecting the Historic Environment from Inland Flooding in the UK: Some
   Thoughts on Current Approaches to Asset Management in the Light of
   Planning Policy, Changing Catchment Hydrology and Climate Change},
Journal = {HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT-POLICY \& PRACTICE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-142},
Abstract = {The impacts of both summer and winter flooding have been acutely felt
   across the inland areas of the UK over the last decade and under
   scenarios of future climate change, such events are likely to become
   more commonplace. Whilst significant emphasis is inevitably placed
   during such emergencies on securing basic major infrastructure (
   transport, power and water), there is also a need to consider how best
   to protect the Historic Environment. A recent Historic England funded
   project undertaken by the authors has sought to map the distribution of
   historic sites against known flood hotspots in Worcestershire to create
   a GIS resource tool for use by emergency planners and other non-heritage
   specialists. In addition to the development of a project GIS, a number
   of further studies were undertaken to consider best practice for flood
   alleviation, explore the impacts of past events on infrastructure and
   communities, and the building of resilience through community action.
   During the lifecycle of the project, a number of key issues and
   challenges were identified with respect to mitigating and managing the
   impacts of flooding upon the Historic Environment, before, during and
   after such events. The Met Office's decision to begin naming severe
   storms from the autumn of 2015 and the associated devastating impacts of
   early examples, such as `Desmond' and `Frank' are leading to an
   ever-increasing focus on extreme events; therefore, the themes explored
   in this paper have resonance beyond the administrative boundaries of
   Worcestershire and are presented within the broader framework of
   environmental management.},

Title = {Decision-Making Approach for Land Use in Urban Industrial Area
   Redevelopment Projects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The process of industrial transformation, becoming the most important
   for building up sustainable cities, is in urgent need for studying
   alternative options for land use to ensure sustainable city development.
   Rapid urbanization requires new built-up design in strong correlation
   with urban spatial planning issues. The objective of this paper is to
   contribute for the studies of sustainable land use solutions through
   investigating the problems of the reorganization of depressed industrial
   areas. The research methodology is based on the multicriteria
   decision-making method to provide primarily social functions of
   depressed industrial areas, depending on environmental and economic
   aspects of their historical location in urban structure. Since the
   article highlights the concept of the 15-min city to build a polycentric
   urban spatial structure, the assessment of supply and demand matching of
   social facilities is based on the analysis of 15 min accessibility to
   the serviced within either industrial zone and the city on the whole.
   The GIS spatial analysis method supports the developed criteria set to
   evaluate main city functions. The research provides the methodology for
   defining the priority land use solution for a specific industrial area
   in a specific location. The proposed methodology suggests a procedure
   for evaluating the importance of the land use composition for the city
   community, considering environmental requirements and cost-effectiveness
   of the project. Three different industrial zones located in the same
   city are a case study to asses the reliability of the proposed
   methodology. The research conclusion provides implementing sustainable
   land-use solutions for improving urban environment quality as well as
   the quality of life for the population.},

Abstract = {With billions of pounds in lost time and mistakes, the digitisation of
   information in the construction industry provides the biggest
   opportunity for improving the built environment assets that people use
   every day. There is a continued push to improve management and delivery
   of the best possible products for the users. With growing recognition
   that more intelligent methods for planning and designing assets is
   required. Whilst the construction sector made significant gains through
   the current information digitisation efforts, there is still vast
   amounts of information that needs to be digitised to ensure usability
   and add more value to the lifecycle of an asset. This paper provides the
   initial framework to analyse the impact of requirements validation of an
   infrastructure asset with real world data, using ifc, asset register and
   GIS files to demonstrate compliance. It uses systems engineering
   principles for the application of requirements decomposition, breakdown,
   and modelling of various MBSE models to show how a function and
   capability can be validated using semantic web techniques to exchange
   data. The framework is demonstrated through a high-level case study for
   the compliance of a fire safety system of a railway station, based on
   system and construction data models. Further validation has been
   accomplished through subject matter expert feedback.},

Abstract = {For Romania, as for many European countries, the most damaging
   geophysical events are floods, which cause significant damage every year
   over large areas, with the loss of human lives and economic
   consequences. Flood forecasting, warning and emergency response play
   important roles ill reducing flood risk during the event. Options for
   flood risk management range from structural measures, such as raising
   dikes or channel enlargement, to non-structural measures to reduce
   exposure and vulnerability. The April 2000 floods in the western part of
   Romania (Crisuri River Basin) represented the starting point in creating
   a dedicated system for flood management using Earth Observation (EO)
   data. Starting from April 2005 this satellite-based surveillance system,
   connected to a dedicated GIS database, was extended to cover the whole
   Romanian territory. In order to obtain high-level thematic products, the
   data extracted from EO images were integrated with other spatial
   ancillary data (topographical, pedological, meteorological) and
   hydrological/hydraulic model outputs. A series of specific image
   processing operations were performed, using the ERDAS Imagine software:
   geometric correction and geo-referencing, image improvement, statistic
   analyses, etc. The optical and microwave satellite data supplied by the
   new European and American orbital platforms like the EOS-AM ``Terra{''}
   and EOS-PM ``Aqua{''}, DMSP, Quikscat, SPOT, ERS, RADARSAT, Landsat7
   have been used to identify and highlight flooded areas.
   This approach is used in different phases of establishing the sensitive
   areas such as: the database management; the calculation of risk indices
   from morpho-hydrographical, meteorological and hydrological data;
   interfacing with the models in order to improve their compatibility with
   input data; recovery of results and the possibility of working out
   scenarios; presentation of results as synthesis maps easy to access and
   interpret, adequate to also be combined with other information layouts
   resulted from the GIS database. The products which are useful for flood
   risk analysis include: accurately updated maps of land cover/land-use,
   comprehensive thematic maps at various spatial scales with the extent of
   the flooded areas and the affected zones, maps of hazard-prone areas.
   The satellite-based products contributed to a preventive consideration
   of extreme flood events by developing plans for flood mitigation,
   building infrastructure in flood-prone areas and by optimizing the
   distribution of spatial flood-related information to local and river
   authorities.},

Abstract = {According to statistics, there are 11, 065 kinds of infrastructural
   projects in the Yellow River Basin that result in very severe new soil
   erosion and increasingly deteriorate die eco - environment. No doubt
   it's imminent to control the man - induced soil erosion by laws and
   regulations of soil and water conservation and harmonize the
   relationship between economic development and environment protection.
   Therefore the fundamental considerations about prevention and control of
   soil erosion from human activities in the coming years are defined, and
   the correspondingly approaches mainly include: firstly, monitor the
   situation of soil erosion resulting from human activities by applying
   the technologies of RS, GIS and GPS to provide reliable data for
   supervision and management; secondly, carry out regular or irregular
   check of law enforcement by focusing on the national key supervision
   zones, the area with excessive and coarse sand in die middle reaches of
   the Yellow River to reduce the sand greatly from irrational human
   activities into the Yellow River; thirdly, put all kinds of measures
   into effect to protect die source area of the Yellow River; fourthly,
   attach great importance to demonstration work and extension of
   experiences to promote the whole basin supervision work; fifthly,
   intensifying capacity building to improve law enforcement; sixthly,
   perfect the relevant technical criterion as soon as possible, establish
   the database of prevention and supervision for soil and water
   conservation in the Yellow River Basin to realize the standardization
   and modernization.},

Abstract = {During last decades, the international community has become aware of the
   need to adapt to the effects of climate change, as the sensitivity of
   natural and human systems gained relevance. Europe is one of the most
   urbanized regions, accounting for a 73\% of people living in urban
   areas. This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has
   concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are
   considered as one of the most vulnerable areas.
   European cities are characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage,
   which is commonly located in what is defined as the historic city. In
   order to protect urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis
   should be given to the integration of conservation management and urban
   planning strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable
   development.
   Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy
   and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to
   address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a
   sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing
   building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and
   social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a
   new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should
   be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole
   city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE
   project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate
   change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context.
   Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at
   urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the
   context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the
   overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive
   measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve
   resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with
   the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order
   to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of
   object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they
   are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in
   clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its
   stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability
   vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage
   and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the
   overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk
   scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures.
   Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an
   evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more
   educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit
   eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of
   climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and
   public authorities.},

Abstract = {At the last decades the awareness of the role of developing and
   improving the technological means in order to support better response
   during disasters such as earthquake and huge forest fire, became
   critical. Hence, the first responders agencies (Firefighters, police,
   Red Cross, municipality etc.) requires a geospatial dataset to manage,
   operate, coordinate and make their decisions based on a ``common
   language{''} in order to navigate in real time, and to cooperate ``on
   the field{''} in an appropriate way for saving life's. Due to the event
   of huge forest fire in the Carmel Forest at the northern area in the
   state of Israel, the Survey of Israel promoted the development and
   dissemination of National First Responders Geospatial Dataset (NFRGD) to
   all of the first responder's agencies and municipalities.
   In the State of Israel, there are more than 1.9 million buildings and
   160,000 km of roads and unpaved roads, but only about 30\% have an
   unequivocal name or official number. Since all emergency forces use
   navigation applications to locate, plan the route and arrive to the
   event area, most of the buildings and roads cannot be located by means
   of navigation, because there is no unique identification for them. In
   these cases, the forces will base their way to the event on prior
   acquaintance with the area of activity. This knowledge exists only in
   the local emergency and rescue forces. In huge events, when forces are
   being enlisted from other service areas to help, and they are not
   familiar with the local geography, they must work and communicate based
   on common spatial database.
   The main challenges of the NFRGD development were:
   1. Designing a product that will be generic to the whole of the First
   Responders agencies.
   2. Dissemination of the dataset in frequency that enable the First
   Responders agencies IT to integrate the data set in theirsystems.
   3. Overcome complex use cases due to the complexity of the reality
   representation in National Topographic Data Base.
   This article will describe the methodology of the geo computation and
   algorithms, which implemented in the development of the NFRGD. The
   algorithms were characterized and developed by a joint team of
   representatives from the first responders, the chief scientist and
   systems analysts of the Survey of Israel (SOI).},

Abstract = {Spatial Planning is a master course for graduate students of
   Environmental Engineering. The course is based on assumptions that
   students' future work will be connected with spatial planning, and
   spatial issues will have an influence on their everyday lives. To
   familiarize students with environmental issues in planning, the teams of
   students get an assignment to design an urban space, waterfront along a
   stream. The whole project consists of four subprojects logically linked
   with each other. To prepare students for public engagement in planning,
   collaborative learning elements have been implemented.
   A variety of blended learning and collaborative learning activities have
   been designed. Traditional face-to-face classes involve lectures, staff
   consultation hours, project work, presentations and open discussions for
   all students enrolled for the course. E-learning components have been
   developed in Moodle, and they include activities such as: building an
   open glossary, voting on presentations and others.
   Moodle platform is also used as a database of students' subprojects and
   presentations in read-only mode. Moreover, it allows assessing the
   results of student work according to defined criteria, creating
   databases of links to data sources, encouraging student public
   participation by informing them about open meetings, conferences and
   seminars. The students also use other open source systems such as GIS
   (Geographical Information Systems), WMS (Web Map Systems), institutions
   websites and CAD software for data visualization.
   The main problems that appeared while running the course were mostly
   connected to collaborative team work and failure of additional
   activities, which were only used by a few students (the quiz was an
   exception). The course was evaluated anonymously by students, who gave
   several pieces of advice on course improvement, mainly on collaborative
   work.
   This article presents the structure of the course and correlation
   between collaborative learning and blended learning and its effects. The
   problems that appeared during the first year of the course are discussed
   below. The conclusions drawn from the analysis of the course will be
   used as guidelines for future improvements of the Spatial Planning
   teaching process.},
