THE FRAMEWORK IS INTENDED TO BE USED EARLY IN THE DESIGN STAGE TO ASSIST DECISION MAKING IN IDENTIFYING SOURCES OF HIGHER EMBODIED IMPACTS AND IN SELECTING SUSTAINABLE DESIGN ALTERNATIVES. THE FRAMEWORK COVERS COMMONLY USED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS SUCH AS REINFORCED CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION (RCC), HOT-ROLLED STEEL CONSTRUCTION (HRS), AND LIGHT STEEL CONSTRUCTION (LSC). THE SYSTEM BOUNDARY IS DEFINED FOR THE FRAMEWORK FROM CRADLE-TO-GRAVE PLUS RECYCLING AND REUSE POSSIBILITIES. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT ARE INTEGRATED IN THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY AND EMBODIED GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS OF DESIGN OPTIONS. THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATA USED TO DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK WERE EXTRACTED FROM BIM MODELS FOR THE BUILDING MATERIAL QUANTITIES, VERIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPD) FOR THE MATERIAL PRODUCTION STAGE, AND THE DESIGN OF CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND END-OF-LIFE STAGES. APPLICATION OF THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK TO A CASE STUDY OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING REVEALED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS. THE MATERIAL PRODUCTION STAGE HAD THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTION TO EMBODIED IMPACTS, REACHING ABOUT 90\%. COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL RCC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 41\% MORE LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 34\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY. WHEN EACH SYSTEM WAS CREDITED WITH THE NET BENEFITS RESULTING FROM POSSIBLE RECYCLING/REUSE BEYOND BUILDING LIFE, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 10\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 68\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY. SIMILARLY, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 29\% LESS LIFE CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 62\% LESS LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS. SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RCC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED ZERO LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CREDIT POINTS, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED THREE LEED CREDIT POINTS, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED FIVE LEED CREDIT POINTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); CAIRO UNIVERSITY","461","M.ABOUHAMAD@ENG.CU.EDU.EG ABUHAMD@ENG.CU.EDU.EG",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su13020461","PY0TL","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JAN",NA,"42","2","GREEN PUBLISHED, GOLD","ABOUHAMAD, MONA/0000-0002-3278-2655 ABU-HAMD, METWALLY/0000-0001-9176-5540",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","ABOUHAMAD, MONA/HFZ-9739-2022 ABU-HAMD, METWALLY/ABC-4643-2020 ABOUHAMAD, MONA/C-6102-2019 ",NA,36,"LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS","ARTICLE","WOS000611762500001","8","69","13","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"ABOUHAMAD MONA;ABU-HAMD METWALLY","ABU-HAMD, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CAIRO UNIV, FAC ENGN, GIZA 12613, EGYPT","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","CAIRO UNIV;CAIRO UNIV","CAIRO UNIV",NA,"ABOUHAMAD M, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY","ABOUHAMAD M, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

THE ASSESSMENT COVERS ALL PHASES OVER THE LIFE SPAN OF THE BUILDING FROM MATERIAL PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION, USE, AND THE END OF BUILDING LIFE, IN ADDITION TO LOADS AND BENEFITS FROM REUSE/RECYCLING AFTER BUILDING DISPOSAL. THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INDICATORS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE ATHENA IMPACT ESTIMATOR FOR BUILDINGS. THE INPUT DATA RELATED TO THE BUILDING MATERIALS USED ARE EXTRACTED FROM A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL OF THE BUILDING WHILE THE OPERATING ENERGY IN THE USE PHASE IS CALCULATED USING AN ENERGY SIMULATION SOFTWARE. THE ATHENA IMPACT ESTIMATOR CALCULATES THE FOLLOWING MID-POINT ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES: GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, HUMAN HEALTH POTENTIAL, OZONE DEPLETION POTENTIAL, SMOG POTENTIAL, EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL, PRIMARY AND NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY (PE) CONSUMPTION, AND FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE LCA ASSESSMENT WAS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING. RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY RELATED TO GWP AND PE WERE AS FOLLOWS. THE BUILDING FOUNDATIONS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 29\% OF THE EMBODIED GWP AND 20\% OF THE EMBODIED PE, WHILE THE CFS SKELETON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 30\% OF THE EMBODIED GWP AND 49\% OF THE EMBODIED PE. THE PRODUCTION STAGE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 90\% OF THE EMBODIED GWP AND EMBODIED PE. WHEN BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH RECYCLING/REUSE WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS ACCORDING TO MODULE D OF EN 15978, THE EMBODIED GWP WAS REDUCED BY 15.4\% WHILE THE EMBODIED PE WAS REDUCED BY 6.22\%.

THE CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS CONSIDERED ARE REINFORCED CONCRETE FRAMING (RC), STRUCTURAL STEEL FRAMING (SS) AND COLD-FORMED STEEL FRAMING (CFS). THE FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT GUIDELINES FOR LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINABILITY AND IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING IN THE DESIGN STAGE. THE SYSTEM BOUNDARY FOR THE STUDY IS FROM CRADLE-TO-GRAVE, INCLUDING ALL COST COMPONENTS FROM CONSTRUCTION STAGE, USE STAGE AND DISPOSAL STAGE IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE RECYCLING/REUSE OPTIONS. THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING, ENERGY SIMULATION MODELING AND END OF LIFE SCENARIOS TO CALCULATE AND COMPARE LIFE CYCLE COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY ADVANTAGES OF CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM ALTERNATIVES. ALL FUTURE COSTS ARE DISCOUNTED TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE INPUT PARAMETERS ARE MODELED USING REALISTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEN USED IN A MONTE CARLO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE INPUT PARAMETERS ON THE RESULT. APPLICATION OF THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM TO A UNIVERSITY BUILDING REVEALED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS. THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST IS NEARLY THE SAME FOR RC FRAMING SYSTEM AND CFS FRAMING SYSTEM, WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST OF SS FRAMING SYSTEM IS 13.4\% MORE. WHEN THE SYSTEM IS CREDITED FOR POSSIBLE REVENUES RESULTING FROM EARLY OPERATION AND RECYCLING/REUSE, THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST OF THE RC FRAMING SYSTEM AND THE SS FRAMING SYSTEM BECOME NEARLY THE SAME WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST OF THE CFS FRAMING SYSTEM BECOMES 22\% LESS. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS SHOWS THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE HAS THE MOST EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED MEAN COST FOLLOWED BY THE INFLATION RATE AND THE CONSTRUCTION COST.

TRADITIONAL FRAGMENTED TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED, AND THIS HAS LED TO INSTANCES OF POOR COMMUNICATION AND SUBPAR PERFORMANCE, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF REPAIR AND RESTORATION INITIATIVES. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) EMERGED AS A GROUND-BREAKING STRATEGY THAT OFFERS A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF A BUILDING'S ATTRIBUTES AND FACILITATES EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION AMONG SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINES HOW BIM IMPACTS COMPLEX BUILDING MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A STRUCTURE'S EXISTENCE. IT FOCUSES ON HOW BIM HELPS TO ADVANCE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES, ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES, AND PROJECT EFFECTIVENESS. EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA), STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM), AND LITERATURE RESEARCH ARE THE THREE PHASES OF THE STUDY'S METHODOLOGY. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN PAKISTAN'S RAWALPINDI AND ISLAMABAD REGION UTILIZING A QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUE. THE POLL OF 159 PARTICIPANTS PRODUCED INTRIGUING FINDINGS. THE PROCESS OF EFA SERVES TO VERIFY CONSTRUCTS AND QUESTIONS, ENSURING THEIR RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, SEM IS USED TO ASSESS THE STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES AND THEIR IMPACT ON BIM BASED LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE APPLICATION OF BIM IS FAVORABLY INFLUENCED BY EACH PHASE OF A PROJECT, NAMELY DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, RENOVATION AND RETROFITTING, AND END-OF-LIFE DECISIONS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT A COMPLETE BIM STRATEGY ACROSS ALL STAGES OF A PROJECT'S LIFESPAN, WHICH MAY ENHANCE FACILITY MANAGEMENT, DECREASE EXPENSES, AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR PROFESSIONALS AND POLITICIANS, HIGHLIGHTING THE CRUCIAL NEED TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS TO PROMOTE THE USE OF BIM IN BUILDING PROJECTS.","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","NAJRAN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS; NAJRAN UNIVERSITY; UMM AL QURA UNIVERSITY","105831","MAABUHUSSAIN@NU.EDU.SA AHSAN\_21002791@UTP.EDU.MY ABDUL\_22011131@UTP.EDU.MY IDRIS\_OTHMAN@UTP.EDU.MY BSALOTAIBI@NU.EDU.SA FMALTHOEY@NU.EDU.SA MAABUHUSSAIN@UQU.EDU.SA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.istruc.2023.105831","HH3H7",NA,"JAN 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2352-0124","STRUCTURES","STRUCTURES","ENGLISH","FEB",NA,"56",NA,NA,"ALTHOEY, FADI/0000-0002-7223-213X",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","ENGINEERING","ABUHUSSAIN, MOHAMMED/GWN-0701-2022 KHAN, ABDUL MATEEN/JUF-0000-2023 ALTHOEY, FADI/AGX-7523-2022",NA,10,"INTEGRATING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) FOR OPTIMAL LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT OF COMPLEX STRUCTURES","ARTICLE","WOS001158557600001","6","20","60","ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2024,"ABUHUSSAIN MOHAMMED AWAD;WAQAR AHSAN;KHAN ABDUL MATEEN; OTHMAN IDRIS;ALOTAIBI BADR SAAD;ALTHOEY FADI;ABUHUSSAIN; MAHER","KHAN, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TEKNOL PETRONAS, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TRONOH 32610, PERAK, MALAYSIA","ISI","STRUCTURES","UNIV TEKNOL PETRONAS;NAJRAN UNIV;UNIV TEKNOL PETRONAS;NAJRAN UNIV;UMM AL QURA UNIV","UNIV TEKNOL PETRONAS",NA,"ABUHUSSAIN MA, 2024, STRUCTURES","ABUHUSSAIN MA, 2024, STRUCTURES",NA

A REVIEW OF THE EXTANT LITERATURE WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SALVAGE PERFORMANCE OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF BUILDINGS DURING THEIR USEFUL LIFE. THEREAFTER, A MATHEMATICAL MODELLING APPROACH WAS ADOPTED TO DEVELOP BWPE USING THE IDENTIFIED FACTORS AND PRINCIPLE/CONCEPT OF WEIBULL RELIABILITY DISTRIBUTION FOR MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. THE MODEL WAS IMPLEMENTED IN BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) ENVIRONMENT AND IT WAS TESTED USING CASE STUDY DESIGN. ACCORDINGLY, THE WHOLE-LIFE SALVAGE PERFORMANCE PROFILES OF THE CASE STUDY BUILDING WERE GENERATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT BUILDING DESIGN WITH STEEL STRUCTURE, DEMOUNTABLE CONNECTIONS, AND PREFABRICATED ASSEMBLIES PRODUCE RECOVERABLE MATERIALS THAT ARE MOSTLY REUSABLE. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT BWPE IS AN OBJECTIVE MEANS FOR DETERMINING HOW MUCH OF RECOVERABLE MATERIALS FROM BUILDINGS ARE REUSABLE AND RECYCLABLE AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE. BWPE WILL THEREFORE PROVIDE A DECISION SUPPORT MECHANISM FOR THE ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS TO ANALYSE THE IMPLICATION, OF DESIGNS DECISION ON THE SALVAGE PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS OVER TIME. IT WILL ALSO BE USEFUL TO THE DEMOLITION ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS TO GENERATE PRE-DEMOLITION AUDIT WHEN THE BUILDING GETS TO END OF ITS LIFE.","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF WEST ENGLAND; OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIVERSITY",NA,"AYOLOOK2001@YAHOO.CO.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.026","FR9TZ","1879-0658",NA,NA,"ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC); INNOVATE UK [54832-413479, 102473]; EPSRC [EP/N509012/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; INNOVATE UK [102473] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND EXPRESS THEIR SINCERE GRATITUDE TO THE ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) AND INNOVATE UK (GRANT APPLICATIONS NO. 54832-413479/FILE NO. 102473) FOR PROVIDING THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THIS STUDY.",NA,"0921-3449","RESOUR.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PROPOSE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO ESTIMATE SERVICE LIFE OF BUILDING PRODUCTS BY INCLUDING BOTH TECHNICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS. METHODS A HYBRID SERVICE LIFE PREDICTION METHOD, COMBINING THE STATISTICAL APPROACH DESCRIBED IN AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR TESTING AND MATERIALS STANDARD G166 WITH THE FACTOR METHOD ADOPTED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION STANDARD 15686, WAS PROPOSED. IN THEIR CURRENT FORMS, THE TWO METHODS ARE NOT SUITABLE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE LIFETIME ESTIMATES FOR THE WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN BUILDINGS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PREFERRED OVER A DETERMINISTIC APPROACH. REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO DEFINE WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS FOR EACH PRODUCT. THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE THEN USED TO CALCULATE THE MEAN ESTIMATED SERVICE LIFE OF PRODUCTS WITH AN 80\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. USING ACTUAL LIFETIME OBSERVED FROM PRACTICE INSTEAD OF DESIGN LIFETIME FOR REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE WAS PREFERRED. THIS ENABLES THE USE OF A SMALLER RANGE OF COEFFICIENTS FOR EACH FACTOR AFFECTING SERVICE LIFE, WHICH DECREASES SUBJECTIVITY AND INCREASES RELIABILITY OF RESULTS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION EXAMPLE MEDIAN SERVICE LIFE ESTIMATES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR COMMON RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR FINISHES THAT ARE REPLACED MORE FREQUENTLY, AND THEREFORE REQUIRE MORE MAINTENANCE PLANNING AND POTENTIALLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. PROBABILITY OF RENOVATION DISTRIBUTIONS WAS ALSO PRESENTED FOR INTERIOR FINISHES. THE PROPOSED METHOD INHERENTLY INCLUDES SOCIAL FACTORS IN THE DATASET USED TO DEFINE LIFETIME DISTRIBUTIONS, WHICH COULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS DURABILITY FOR SOME BUILDING PRODUCT CATEGORIES. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT CHOOSING REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE BASED ON REAL-LIFE CONDITIONS DECREASES THE RANGE OF COEFFICIENTS NECESSARY FOR MODIFYING FACTORS IN COMPARISON TO WHEN DESIGN LIFETIME IS USED, THUS DECREASING THE SUBJECTIVITY OF RESULTS DUE TO VARIATIONS IN ASSIGNED VALUES BY DIFFERENT USERS. CONCLUSIONS THE FACTOR METHOD IS THE MOST PROMISING METHOD AVAILABLE TO ESTIMATE SERVICE LIFE OF PRODUCTS. UNLESS ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS WERE GATHERED FOR INVESTIGATED PRODUCTS, THE PRESENTED LIFETIME DISTRIBUTION RESULTS CAN BE DIRECTLY APPLIED TO LCA STUDIES. THE PROPOSED HYBRID METHOD CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE STUDIED WITHIN THE FACTOR METHOD. PRODUCTS WHOSE LIFETIMES ARE INFLUENCED BY SOCIAL FACTORS ARE PRIME CANDIDATES TO APPLY THIS METHOD.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH",NA,"CBA5@PITT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-011-0367-6","933TB","1614-7502",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0948-3349","INT.

SEVERAL FACTORS AFFECT THE SELECTION DECISION, SUCH AS QUALITY, BUILDABILITY, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BUILDING APPEARANCE, HVAC SIZE AND WEIGHT, AND LCC. THESE CRITERIA ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE, AS THEY ARE NOT BASED ON AGREED MEASUREMENT UNITS. ANOTHER CHALLENGING FACTOR IN THE SELECTION PROCESS IS ASSESSING THE BUILDING'S FUNCTION/PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINING ITS HVAC NEEDS. CURRENTLY, THE DECISION DEPENDS MOSTLY ON EXPERT KNOWLEDGE, AND THERE IS NO AGREED-UPON SYSTEMATIC METHOD TO FOLLOW. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC MODEL FOR SELECTING HVAC SYSTEMS BASED ON THE VALUE ENGINEERING (VE) CONCEPT. THE MODEL IDENTIFIED FOURTEEN CRITERIA BASED ON AN AGREED STANDARD TEST FOR OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND A TYPICAL EVALUATION FOR SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA. THESE HVAC CRITERIA WERE ASSESSED USING A COMBINATION OF THE AHP, PAIRWISE, FUNCTION ANALYSIS SYSTEM (FAST), AND MONTE CARLO TECHNIQUES. AS A RESULT, A COMPLETE MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO ENHANCE THE SELECTION PROCESS, PROGRAMMED WITHIN THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) ENVIRONMENT PLATFORM. SEVERAL HVAC EXPERTS WERE INTERVIEWED AND MORE THAN TWENTY EXPERT OPINIONS WERE COLLECTED TO VALIDATE THE MODEL.

MANY GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS (GBRSS) USE LCA TO VARIOUS DEGREES. IN THIS PAPER, A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE LCA SOFTWARE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO BUILDING DESIGNERS. A WHOLE-BUILDING LCA WAS PERFORMED FOR A LARGE BUILDING USING THREE SOFTWARE LCA TOOLS. THE SOFTWARE TOOLS VARY IN KEY ASPECTS, SUCH AS INTENDED USERS (E.G., LCA EXPERTS OR NOVICES), DESIGN STAGE IN WHICH THEY CAN BE USED, AND TIME. THE EVALUATED LCA TOOLS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR USE IN EARLY DESIGN AND DECISION MAKING. SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS RELY ON A BILL OF MATERIALS THAT CHANGES CONSTANTLY IN DESIGN ALTERATIONS. HOWEVER, OTHERS SHOWED A GREATER ADVANTAGE IN THAT THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. THE COMPARATIVE LCA RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IMPACT OF LCA SOFTWARE IS DEPENDENT ON THE IMPACT CATEGORY AND THE PRECISION IN THE PROCESS OF MATERIAL QUANTITIES TAKEOFF. THE CASE STUDY WAS INFLUENCED BY THE BUILDING TYPE AND ITS INTENSE OPERATIONAL ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. CONVENTIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING THE LIGHTING EFFICIENCY, FAR EXCEEDED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MITIGATE THE EMBEDDED IMPACT OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. THUS, ADVANCING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LCA BASELINE BUILDING AND ADDRESSING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK ARE DISCUSSED. FINALLY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE TRADITIONAL BUILDING'S SYSTEMS THAT ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IN LCA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING OTHER SYSTEMS, SUCH AS PLUMBING, HVAC, AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM).

THERE ARE SEVERAL BENEFITS OF MUTS COMPARED TO BURIED UTILITIES. HOWEVER, MUTS ARE NOT WIDELY USED AT THE TIME BEING DUE TO THE HIGH INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION AMONG UTILITY OWNERS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) IS BECOMING THE MAIN COORDINATION TOOL FOR BUILDING PROJECTS. BIM HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES, SUCH AS BRIDGES, ROADS, AND SEWER NETWORKS. HOWEVER, BIM EXTENSION FOR MUT INFORMATION MODELING (MUTIM) IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED. THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE A METHOD FOR EXTENDING BIM TO MUT PROJECTS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SIMILAR DEVELOPMENTS FOR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR MUTIM USE CASES IS PROPOSED. FIVE USE CASES OF MUTIM WERE MENTIONED IN THIS PAPER: (1) DESIGN REVIEW FOR CHECKING COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS AND CONSTRUCTABILITY; (2) 3D COORDINATION FOR CLASH DETECTION AND RESOLUTION; (3) ERGONOMIC DESIGN FOR HUMAN ACCESSIBILITY AND COMFORT DURING CONSTRUCTION, INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES; (4) PHASE PLANNING FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING USING 4D SIMULATION; AND (5) QUANTITY TAKEOFF FOR COST ESTIMATION. THE FIRST TWO MUTIM USE CASES ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. A CASE STUDY IS DEVELOPED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH. THE PRESENTED MUTIM APPROACH CAN IMPROVE MUT PROJECTS DESIGN AND COORDINATION EFFICIENCY, AND REDUCE PROJECT COST, WHICH ARE THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR PROMOTING MUTS.","UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA","CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY - CANADA; CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY - CANADA",NA,"ALAG\_ALI@ENCS.CONCORDIA.CA HAMMAD@CIISE.CONCORDIA.CA",NA,"CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT","2024-12-23",NA,"BK1ZC",NA,NA,"WANG, C AND HARPER, C AND LEE, Y AND HARRIS, R AND BERRYMAN, C",NA,NA,"978-0-7844-8129-5",NA,NA,"CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT","ENGLISH",NA,"CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS, LOUISIANA STATE UNIV, BERT S TURNER DEPT CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT, NEW ORLEANS, LA, APR 02-04, 2018","22",NA,NA,"ALAGHBANDRAD, ALI/0000-0002-6456-7562","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, CONSTRUCT INST, CONSTRUCT RES COUNCIL; AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS; AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, CONSTRUCT INST","393-402","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","ALAGHBANDRAD, ALI/ABR-9403-2022 ",NA,1,"DEVELOPING INFORMATION MODEL FOR MULTI-PURPOSE UTILITY TUNNEL LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000432426900040","0","17",NA,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2018,"ALAGHBANDRAD ALI;HAMMAD AMIN","ALAGHBANDRAD, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CONCORDIA UNIV, DEPT BLDG CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, 1515 ST CATHERINE ST WEST, MONTREAL, PQ H3G 2W1, CANADA","ISI","CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT","CONCORDIA UNIV;CONCORDIA UNIV;CONCORDIA UNIV","CONCORDIA UNIV",NA,"ALAGHBANDRAD A, 2018, CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT","ALAGHBANDRAD A, 2018, CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT",NA

SUCH A SCENARIO IS ENCOUNTERED IN SEVERAL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BUT UP TO THE AUTHOR'S KNOWLEDGE, NO PREVIOUS STUDY DEALT WITH ITS DETAILED ASSESSMENT AND OPTIMIZATION. THE PROBLEM FORMULATION CONSIDERS USING THE LEVELIZED COST OF ELECTRICITY (LCOE) AND THE CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT (CEB) AS TWO LIFE-CYCLE CONFLICTING OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS. FIRST, A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION TECHNIQUE WAS DEVELOPED TO PREDICT ACCURATELY THE PV POWER GENERATION UNDER A TIME RESOLUTION OF 15 MIN AS RECOMMENDED FOR PV-SELF CONSUMPTION STUDIES. A NEW MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION WAS AS WELL DERIVED TO CALCULATE MORE ACCURATELY THE CEB CONSIDERING BOTH THE DEGRADATION OF THE PV PRODUCTIVITY OVER THE PROJECT LIFETIME AND THE DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF THE ELECTRICITY MIX OF THE COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO TIME. A GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) IS USED TO IDENTIFY PARETO FRONTIERS AND TECHNIQUE FOR ORDER PREFERENCE BY SIMILARITY TO IDEAL SOLUTION ``TOPSIS'' DECISION-MAKING METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO SELECT THE FINAL OPTIMUM. THE FOLLOWED APPROACH WAS APPLIED FOR A LARGE MOROCCAN COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE WITH AN ANNUAL ELECTRIC LOAD OF 2.932 GWH. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RECOMMENDED OPTIMUM PV INSTALLED CAPACITY IS 847.4 KW(P). THIS OPTIMIZED DESIGN LEADS TO THE BEST COMPROMISE BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS AND THE LCOE IS 15.12 C\$/KWH WHILE THE CEB IS 7.89 TONNES CO2. THE CORRESPONDING SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND SELF-CONSUMPTION RATIOS WERE ESTIMATED AT 41.41\% AND 79.14\%, RESPECTIVELY. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER LTD.

BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, THE PAPER WILL PROPOSE A PROCESS MODEL, NAMELY, LIFECYCLE EXCHANGE OF ASSET DATA (LEAD) TO MANAGE ASSET DATAFLOW BETWEEN ALL BUILDING STAKEHOLDERS FROM DESIGN TO CONSTRUCTION AND ULTIMATELY TO THE FACILITY MANAGEMENT TEAM. THIS MODEL AIMS TO HELP THE CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN TO PRODUCE COMPLETE AND HIGH-QUALITY ASSET DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE OPERATION PHASE OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A REVIEW OF RELEVANT STUDIES PROVIDED A THEORETICAL BACKGROUND FOR THIS STUDY. THE AUTHORS THEN COLLECTED AND ANALYSED COBIE DATA FROM FIVE LIVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) PROJECTS FROM DIFFERENT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES. THE PROCESS MODEL IS BASED ON AN INDUSTRY PLACEMENT WITHIN BOUYGUES UK CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, WHICH WAS A TIER 1 BUILDING CONTRACTOR IN LONDON IN THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 2016 TO DECEMBER 2018. THE RESEARCHER USED AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH OBSERVING CURRENT PRACTISES IN TWO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO PRODUCE ``LEAD'' MODEL. THEN A FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO DISCUSS AND REFINE THE PROCESS MODEL. FINDINGS - ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE AND DATA COLLECTED IN THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT ALTHOUGH COBIE IS A BIM LEVEL 2 STANDARD IN THE UK, THERE IS CURRENTLY A LOW SUCCESS RATE IN PRODUCING COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COBIE DATA IN THE UK CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THIS LOW RATE IS BECAUSE OF COBIE'S RIGID DATA SYNTAX/STRUCTURE, COMPLEXITY AND AMBIGUITY OF ITS DATA EXCHANGE PROCESS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT COBIE MAY NOT BE THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE STUDY PROPOSED A PROCESS MODEL, NAMELY, ``LEAD,'' TO IMPROVE COBIE OUTPUT AND ALSO TO BE USED WITH PROJECT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS PAPER IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO FOCUS SOLELY ON ASSET DATA EXCHANGE PROCESS USING COBIE STANDARD AND HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEMS THE INDUSTRY FACES IN THIS REMIT. THE STUDY IS BASED ON INDUSTRY PLACEMENT FOR TWO YEARS, SO THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON ACTUAL AND CURRENT INDUSTRY PROBLEMS. CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES ALSO INFORMED THE ``LEAD'' MODEL, AND THE MODEL PROVIDES A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDANCE IN PRODUCING AND EXCHANGING BIM ASSET DATA IN ALL STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH COBIE AS AN ASSET DATA EXCHANGE STANDARD. UNDERSTANDING THESE PROBLEMS IS OF HIGH VALUE FOR INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS TO AVOID THEM IN PROJECTS. THE PAPER ALSO PROPOSED A NOVEL PROCESS MODEL THAT CAN BE USED EITHER TO IMPROVE COBIE QUALITY OR CAN BE USED WITH ANY PROJECT-SPECIFIC DATA REQUIREMENTS.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF LONDON; UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON",NA,"AALNAGGAR@MSN.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/JFM-06-2019-0030","JS7FB","1741-0983",NA,NA,"BOUYGUES UK; BOUYGUES ENERGIES AND SERVICES","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK BOUYGUES UK AND BOUYGUES ENERGIES AND SERVICES FOR PROVIDING THE FUNDING AND ENABLING ACCESS TO THE BIM DOCUMENTATION THAT FORMED THE CORE FOR THIS RESEARCH.

FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE BUILDING, THERE EXISTS A STANDARDIZED METHOD, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), HOWEVER, THE PROCESS REQUIRES TIME, COST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY EXPERTISE. IN THIS PAPER, A METHOD IS PROPOSED AND ANALYZED FOR THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF THE BUILDING FOR THE EMBODIED CARBON IN THE THREE STAGES, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, AND DEMOLITION. MOREOVER, THE RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS IS CONSIDERED AS THE BASE RESULT, AND DE-CARBONIZATION STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED THROUGH LITERATURE STUDY FOR THE THREE STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, AND DEMOLITION ARE ASSESSED WITH THE SAME METHOD TO KNOW HOW MUCH EACH STRATEGY WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN MINIMIZING THE EMBODIED CARBON. FOR THE BASE CASE, A HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN AN URBAN REGION OF INDIA IS ANALYZED, BASED ON EXISTING CONDITIONS THROUGH THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) METHOD. THE CARBON EMISSION OF THE SELECTED BUILDING COMES OUT TO BE 414 KG CO(2)E/M(2)/YEAR, AND ASSESSING DIFFERENT DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES, CONSIDERING THE FIRST ANALYSIS AS THE BASELINE, IT CAN BE MINIMIZED TO 135 KG CO(2)E/M(2)/YEAR.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","NAJRAN UNIVERSITY; JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA; AL-AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIVERSITY; ALIGARH MUSLIM UNIVERSITY","1203","MAABUHUSSAIN@NU.EDU.SA ARCHITECTARIF@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings12081203","4A4SF","2075-5309",NA,NA,"DEANSHIP OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT NAJRAN UNIVERSITY [NU/-/SERC/10/567]; NAJRAN UNIVERSITY","THE RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE DEANSHIP OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AT NAJRAN UNIVERSITY GRANT NUMBER NU/-/SERC/10/567 AND THE APC WAS FUNDED BY NAJRAN UNIVERSITY.",NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","AUG",NA,"73","8","GOLD","ALOTAIBI, BADR/0000-0003-1690-5202 AL-TAMIMI, NEDHAL/0000-0003-4089-8671 ELNAKLAH, RANA/0000-0001-8365-8884",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","KAMAL, MOHAMMAD/AAY-5589-2020 ABUHUSSAIN, MOHAMMED/GWN-0701-2022 AL-TAMIMI, NEDHAL/B-8508-2019 ",NA,13,"LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF EMBODIED CARBON AND STRATEGIES FOR DECARBONIZATION OF A HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING","ARTICLE","WOS000845092500001","14","66","12","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2022,"ALOTAIBI BADR SAAD;KHAN SAHIL ALI;ABUHUSSAIN MOHAMMED AWAD;AL-TAMIMI NEDHAL;ELNAKLAH RANA;KAMAL MOHAMMAD ARIF","ABUHUSSAIN, MA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NAJRAN UNIV, COLL ENGN, ARCHITECTURAL ENGN DEPT, NAJRAN 66426, SAUDI ARABIA","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","NAJRAN UNIV;ALIGARH MUSLIM UNIV;NAJRAN UNIV;FAC ARCHITECTURE AND EKIST;AL AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIV;ALIGARH MUSLIM UNIV","NAJRAN UNIV",NA,"ALOTAIBI BS, 2022, BUILDINGS-BASEL","ALOTAIBI BS, 2022, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A DATA SET OF 20 BUILDING PROJECTS IS USED TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TWO (ANNS/REGRESSION) MODELS IN ESTIMATING RUNNING COST. THE CONCEPT OF COST-SIGNIFICANTITEMS IS IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT IN ASSISTING ESTIMATION. IN ADDITION, A STEPWISE TECHNIQUE IS USED TO ELIMINATE INSIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN REGRESSION MODELLING. A CONNECTION WEIGHT METHOD IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF COST FACTORS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANNS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT THE VALUE OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION = 99.75 PER CENT FOR ANNS MODEL(S), WITH A VALUE OF 98.1 PER CENT UTILISING MULTIPLE REGRESSION (MR) MODEL(S); SECOND, THE MEAN PERCENTAGE ERROR (MPE) FOR ANNS AT A TESTING STAGE IS 0.179, WHICH IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE MPE GAINED THROUGH MR MODELLING OF 1.28; AND THIRD, THE AVERAGE ACCURACY IS 99 PER CENT FOR ANNS MODEL(S) AND 97 PER CENT FOR MR MODEL(S). ON THE BASIS OF THESE RESULTS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT AN ANNS MODEL IS SUPERIOR TO A MR MODEL WHEN PREDICTING RUNNING COST OF BUILDING PROJECTS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - A MEANS FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS ACCURACY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED; THIS MAY BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY FUTURE EXTENDED SAMPLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS WORK EXTENDS THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF LIFE-CYCLE ESTIMATION WHERE ANNS METHOD HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE PREPARATION TIME CONSUMED AND INCREASING ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT OF THE COST ESTIMATION.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","CURTIN UNIVERSITY",NA,"A.ALHAJIRI@HOTMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/BEPAM-08-2014-0035","DI3DA","2044-1258",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2044-124X","BUILT ENVIRON.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - TEN FACTORS AFFECTING LCC IN BUILDING PROJECT COST ESTIMATES ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH LITERATURE AND INTERVIEWS. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY IS CONDUCTED TO RANK THESE FACTORS IN ORDER OF PRIORITY AND PROVIDE THE VIEWS OF COST PRACTITIONERS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FACTORS IN THE ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF LCC. THE DATA FROM 138 CONSTRUCTION BUILDING PROJECTS COMPLETED IN UK WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED VIA MULTIPLE REGRESSION TO DISCOVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LCCS AND BETWEEN NON-COST FACTORS AND COST ESTIMATION AT EACH STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE (CAPITAL, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND LCC). FINDINGS - THE RESULTS OF ANALYSIS OF EXISTING LCC DATA OF COMPLETING PROJECT AND SURVEY DATA FROM COST PROFESSIONALS ARE MOSTLY CONSISTENT WITH MANY LITERATURE VIEWS AND PROVIDE A REASONABLE DESCRIPTION OF THE NON-COST FACTORS AFFECTING THE ACCURACY OF ESTIMATES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE VALUE OF THIS STUDY IS IN THE METHOD USED, WHICH INVOLVES ANALYSIS OF EXISTING LIFE DATA AND SURVEY DATA FROM COST PROFESSIONALS. THE RESULTS PROVIDE A PLAUSIBLE DESCRIPTION OF THE NON-COST FACTORS AFFECTING THE ACCURACY OF ESTIMATES.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","CURTIN UNIVERSITY",NA,"A.ALHAJIRI@HOTMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/JEDT-02-2015-0005","FA5NS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1726-0531","J.

HOWEVER, THE SECTOR'S ADHERENCE TO TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT HAS DELAYED THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF BIM. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A BIMCENTERED METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO A REAL-WORLD HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY LINE (HSRL) PROJECT. THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF HSRL DESIGN PARAMETERS AND THE INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS BIM-BASED TOOLS, A 3D PARAMETRIC DESIGN MODEL IS GENERATED. THIS MODEL SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION FOR EVALUATING UP TO FIVE DESIGN ALTERNATIVES, CONSIDERING TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS. FURTHERMORE, A DEGRADATION MODEL IS PROPOSED TO ASSESS ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE'S FULL LIFECYCLE UNDER SPECIFIC RAIL TRAFFIC ASSUMPTIONS. THIS FACILITATES A RAPID EVALUATION OF ALIGNMENT DESIGN'S IMPACT ON MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE PAPER DRAWS TWO MAIN CONCLUSIONS WITH POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR BOTH PRIVATE COMPANIES AND RAILWAY ADMINISTRATIONS: FIRSTLY, BIM PROVES FEASIBLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS DESPITE SOME INTEROPERABILITY CHALLENGES, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR CONTINUED ADVANCEMENTS IN BIM SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY. SECONDLY, THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN POTENTIALLY LEAD TO UP TO 40\% COST SAVINGS IN MAINTENANCE FOR RAILWAY ADMINISTRATIONS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSIDAD DE CASTILLA-LA MANCHA","105114",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.autcon.2023.105114","FZ3J8","1872-7891","OCT 2023",NA,"DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND BUILDING ENGINEERING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA","THIS WORK WAS FULLY FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND BUILDING ENGINEERING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA.

IDENTIFYING THE OWNER'S NEEDS IN ALL PHASES OF THIS PROCESS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR ACHIEVING SATISFACTORY RESULTS FOR THE BUILDING PROJECT. ADDITIONALLY, THE OWNER'S NEEDS SHOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE WORK SCOPE OF EVERY STAKEHOLDER INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT. NEVERTHELESS, THESE NEEDS ARE NOT ALWAYS ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED IN BUILDING PROJECTS. THUS, THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH REPORTED IN THIS PAPER HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP A MODEL THAT ALLOWS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OWNER'S NEEDS IN ALL PHASES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A SIX LEVEL CLASSIFICA- TION SYSTEM FOR THE INFORMATION REQUIRED IN THE PROJECT AND A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODEL THAT MAPS THE LIFE CYCLE AND THE LOGICAL ACTIONS TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN EACH PHASE. THE MODEL HAS BEEN CORROBORATED AND IMPROVED BY APPLYING THE DELPHI TECHNIQUE TO A PANEL OF TEN EXPERTS IN TWO ROUNDS. THE PRACTICAL USE OF THE MODEL IS THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION OF A SERIES OF QUESTIONNAIRES BUILT UPON THE INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING THE OWNER'S NEEDS.

THE BUILDING ENVELOPE IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT THAT INFLUENCES ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE OPERATIONS COSTS. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY CONSIDERS THE ENVELOPE TO OPTIMISE THE BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC) AND ENHANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE AIM OF THE STUDY, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) WITH THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS (LCCA) IS ADOPTED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING ENVELOPE AND OPTIMISE ENERGY USE AND RELEVANT COSTS. THREE ALTERNATIVES OF WALL SYSTEM: BRICK WALL WITH ROCKWOOL INSULATION, BRICK WALL WITH POLYSTYRENE INSULATION AND CURTAIN WALLS SYSTEM, ARE CONSIDERED FOR THE BUILDING ENVELOPE TO ENHANCE ENERGY-SAVING POTENTIAL BY ANALYSING AND COMPARING THE ENERGY DEMAND. TO DETERMINE LCCA, THE NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) APPROACH WAS ADOPTED FOR THE INITIAL EXPENDITURE AND THE ASSOCIATED FUTURE COSTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT UTILISING INSULATION MATERIAL WITH LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY REDUCES HEATING AND COOLING ENERGY RESULTING OPTIMISED LCC. COMPARED TO CURTAIN WALLS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ROCKWOOL INSULATED WALL REDUCES 17\% OF ENERGY DEMAND WHILE THE POLYSTYRENE WALL REDUCES 12.7\% OF THE ENERGY. SIMILARLY, ROCKWOOL INSULATED WALLS SAVE 5\% ENERGY RELATIVE TO THE WALL SYSTEM WITH POLYSTYRENE INSULATION. THUS, INTEGRATING LCCA WITH THE BIM APPROACH AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGES PROMOTES ENERGY AND LCC OPTIMISATION.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS; DEAKIN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS",NA,"WESAM.ALALOUL@UTP.EDU.MY",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s10668-023-03001-w","JB6L3","1573-2975","FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1387-585X","ENVIRON.

THIS DISPARITY PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES IN PROPERLY USING BIM FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO SUGGEST INVENTIVE AND PRAGMATIC APPROACHES THAT SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL BIM MODEL DATA, WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON COBIE DATASET, AND THE INTENDED BIM APPLICATIONS OUTLINED BY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE EMPLOYER'S INFORMATION REQUIREMENT (EIR) FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION. THE STUDY METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF CURRENT LITERATURE, DEMO CASE STUDIES, AS WELL AS STANDARDS PERTAINING TO BIM DATA, COBIE.TYPE, AND EIR REQUIREMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CONSIST OF A COLLECTION OF STANDARDS, PROCEDURES, AND SUGGESTED PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF AS-BUILT BIM MODEL DATA FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION. THESE WILL CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH THE BIM APPLICATIONS STATED BY THE CLIENT. FURTHERMORE, THE PROJECT SEEKS TO ENHANCE INDUSTRY NORMS AND PRACTICES, PROMOTING ENHANCED COOPERATION AND INFORMATION SHARING AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. THIS RESEARCH HAS ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFICIENCY OF SOLIBRI MODEL CHECKER (SMC) TO VALIDATE THE COBIE TYPE AND COMPONENT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY COBIE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","OKAN UNIVERSITY; AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF RAS AL KHAIMAH; DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","611","E.ALTWASSI@DESIGNZONEKSA.COM EMRE.AYSU@OKAN.EDU.TR ERCOSKUNKEREM@GMAIL.COM A.ABU-RAED@TUDELFT.NL",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings14030611","MD8V9","2075-5309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","MAR",NA,"29","3","GOLD, GREEN PUBLISHED","ABU RAED, ABEER/0000-0003-0766-4494",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING",NA,NA,2,"FROM DESIGN TO MANAGEMENT: EXPLORING BIM'S ROLE ACROSS PROJECT LIFECYCLES, DIMENSIONS, DATA, AND USES, WITH EMPHASIS ON FACILITY MANAGEMENT","ARTICLE","WOS001191789000001","6","13","14","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2024,"ALTWASSI ESRAA J;AYSU EMRE;ERCOSKUN KEREM;ABU RAED; ABEER","ABU RAED, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), AMER UNIV RAS AL KHAIMAH, DEPT ARCHITECTURE, RAS AL KHAYMAH, U ARAB EMIRATES","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","AMER UNIV RAS AL KHAIMAH;DELFT UNIV TECHNOL;ISTANBUL OKAN UNIV;AMER UNIV RAS AL KHAIMAH;DELFT UNIV TECHNOL","AMER UNIV RAS AL KHAIMAH",NA,"ALTWASSI EJ, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL","ALTWASSI EJ, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO INVESTIGATE ENABLERS FOR FACILITATING LCA BECAUSE IDENTIFICATION OF ENABLERS IS A CRUCIAL STEP IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LCA. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ENABLERS FOR FACILITATING LCA FOR THE SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FIVE STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES (ACADEMIA, GOVERNMENT, CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS) AND ALSO AIMS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN THE ENABLERS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH AN EXPLANATORY RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED. THE FIVE STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED ABOVE, WHOSE CONTRIBUTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING LCA IN SRI LANKA, WERE SELECTED FOR DATA COLLECTION. A TOTAL OF 20 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE HELD REPRESENTING EACH STAKEHOLDER CATEGORY. THE REPERTORY GRID INTERVIEW (RGI) TECHNIQUE WAS UTILIZED AND DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT ``ABILITY TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INTERNAL ENABLER FOR ALL STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES'' AND ``THE POSITIVE GROWTH IN THE COUNTRY TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY'' ``THE AVAILABILITY OF STANDARDIZED LCA GUIDES AND HANDBOOKS'' AS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EXTERNAL ENABLERS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES FOR FACILITATING LCA IN THE SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. FURTHER, STRATEGIES INCLUDING MAKING PEOPLE AWARE OF THE LCA CONCEPT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LCA DATABASE, ETC. WERE PROPOSED TO STRENGTHEN THE ENABLERS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS KNOWLEDGE GENERATED THROUGH THIS STUDY WOULD ENABLE THE ABOVEMENTIONED STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS TO PROMOTE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LCA IN THE SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. FURTHER, THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HAVE RAISED AWARENESS OF THE ISSUES THAT SRI LANKA WILL NEED TO SOLVE TO EXPAND THE LCA APPLICATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE SO FAR, RESEARCH ON LCA HAS NOT LOOKED INTO ENABLERS THAT CAN FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LCA IN THE SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THIS RESEARCH PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ENABLERS FOR FACILITATING LCA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FIVE STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES AND IDENTIFIES ENABLERS THAT LED THE ABOVEMENTIONED STAKEHOLDERS TO PURSUE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LCA IN THE SRI LANKAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR CAUSES OF WASTE PRODUCTION OVER THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE IN IRAN'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND TO PROPOSE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS BASED ON MODERN TECHNOLOGIES LIKE BIM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH AFTER IDENTIFYING THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION WASTE PRODUCTION THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND LITERATURE ANALYSIS, SOLUTIONS BASED ON BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WERE PROVIDED. THEN, USING QUESTIONNAIRES AND EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA), THE AREAS IMPACTING WASTE REDUCTION WERE FOUND. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ``PREFABRICATION'' IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR IMPROVING TIME AND QUALITY, WHILE ``DETECTION AND PREDICTION OF ERRORS IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES'' IS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ADDRESSING COST AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE COST, TIME, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS MAY ALL BE INFLUENCED BY EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE. FURTHERMORE, UTILIZING STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES HAS FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR REDUCING MATERIAL WASTE, RESULTING IN MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY CONSTRUCTION.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF QUEBEC; ECOLE DE TECHNOLOGIE SUPERIEURE - CANADA; UNIVERSITY OF TEHRAN",NA,"ESMATULLAH.NOORZAI1980@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/TQM-09-2021-0272","L9DC3","1754-274X","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-2731","TQM J.","TQM JOURNAL","ENGLISH","JUL 12",NA,"85","6",NA,"NOORZAI, ESMATULLAH/0000-0001-5547-1158 AHMADZADEH AMID, SOLMAZ/0000-0003-0174-4127",NA,"1449-1470","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BUSINESS \& ECONOMICS","GOLABCHI, MAHMOOD/AAD-4888-2022 NOORZAI, ESMATULLAH/C-1073-2019 ",NA,1,"IDENTIFYING FACTORS AFFECTING WASTE PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT LIFE CYCLE AND PROPOSING BIM-BASED SOLUTIONS","ARTICLE","WOS000805447000001","3","20","35","MANAGEMENT","EMERGING SOURCES CITATION INDEX (ESCI)",2023,"AMID SOLMAZ AHMADZADEH;NOORZAI ESMATULLAH;GOLABCHI MAHMOOD","NOORZAI, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TEHRAN, DEPT PROJECT \& CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT, TEHRAN, IRAN","ISI","TQM J","UNIV TEHRAN;ECOLE TECHNOL SUPER;UNIV TEHRAN","UNIV TEHRAN",NA,"AMID SA, 2023, TQM J","AMID SA, 2023, TQM J",NA

THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES AN AUTOMATED DESIGN PROCEDURE FORMULATED AS A CONSTRAINED SINGLE-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM TO ACHIEVE THE MINIMUM LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) WITHIN THE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PSO) ALGORITHM AND CAN BE THE BASIS OF CURRENT SEISMIC CODES FOR TARGET SAFETY CALIBRATION. LCC INCLUDES INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST AND LIFETIME SEISMIC LOSSES SUCH AS REPAIR COST, REPAIR TIME, AND CASUALTIES. FEMA P-58 METHODOLOGY IS EMPLOYED FOR THE LCC ANALYSIS OF THE BUILDING UNDER POSSIBLE EARTHQUAKES DURING ITS LIFETIME, WHICH IS ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTIES IN THE HAZARD-RESPONSE-DAMAGE-LOSS RELATIONSHIP. AN APPROPRIATE COST MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE INITIAL AND REPAIR COST OF THE STUDIED BRBS. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF ASCE AND AISC CODES ARE CONSIDERED AS DESIGN CONSTRAINTS. NONLINEAR RESPONSE HISTORY ANALYSIS THROUGH THE ENDURANCE TIME (ET) METHOD IS UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE THE STRUCTURAL RESPONSES VERSUS SEISMIC INTENSITY. THREE 4-, 8-, AND 12-STORY STEEL BUILDINGS WITH DUAL SEISMIC FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM CONSISTING OF SMRF AND BRB (CALLED STEEL SMRF-BRB) ARE SELECTED AS THE CASE STUDY. EACH BUILDING IS OPTIMALLY DESIGNED WITH TWO APPROACHES: (1) LCC-BASED DESIGN WITHIN THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK AND (2) CODE-BASED DESIGN TO MINIMIZE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST. COMPARISON OF OPTIMIZED BUILDINGS WITH THE TWO DESIGN APPROACHES IN TERMS OF STRUCTURAL RESPONSES AND SEISMIC CONSEQUENCES DEMONSTRATES THAT FULFILLING THE MINIMUM CODE REQUIREMENTS AT A GIVEN SEISMIC HAZARD LEVEL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MINIMIZE LIFETIME SEISMIC LOSSES OF STEEL SMRF-BRBS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE OPTIMAL DESIGNS OBTAINED FROM THE CODE-BASED APPROACH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DAMAGE CONCENTRATION, IRREPARABILITY, AND HIGH COLLAPSE PROBABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN SEISMIC EVENTS MORE SEVERE THAN THE DESIGN LEVEL. THE PROPOSED LCC-BASED APPROACH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION FOR IMPROVING THE LIFETIME SEISMIC PERFORMANCE OF STEEL SMRF-BRBS.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","SHARIF UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"H.AHMADIEAMIRI@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1002/eqe.3864","9V7SG","1096-9845","MAR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8847","EARTHQ.

AND, WHAT ADDED VALUE DOES A MORE STRUCTURED AND PRAGMATIC WORK METHOD ADD TO THE USE OF BIM THROUGHOUT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES? A LITERATURE REVIEW ESTABLISHED THE MAIN AREAS TO FURTHER ADDRESS THROUGH A CASE STUDY METHOD. TWO CASES WERE USED, A LIVE PROJECT AND A THEORETICAL PROJECT DEVELOPED BY STUDENTS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE RESEARCHERS AS TEACHERS. THE OUTCOME WAS TO DEVELOP A PRAGMATIC DESIGN STRATEGY THAT IS AS UNCOMPLICATED AS POSSIBLE, BUT CAN LEAD A DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND BIM PROJECT THROUGH THE DESIGN PHASES AND INTO THE CONSTRUCTION AND O\&M PHASES WITH THE USE OF STRUCTURED DATA AND INFORMATION FROM THE MODELS IN AN INTERDISCIPLINARY MANNER. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMMON LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION PROCESS, A PARADIGM FOR A BIM ROADMAP WAS ALSO FURTHER DEVELOPED. THE WORK ALSO DISCOVERS AND INVESTIGATES HOW AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION CAN DEVELOP WORK METHODS THROUGH ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT, TESTS AND EVALUATION IN COLLABORATION WITH PRACTITIONERS FROM THE AEC INDUSTRY.

FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE METHOD MUST BE ABLE TO: (1) INCLUDE FOREGROUND PROCESS MODELING IN ORDER TO AVOID THE ASSUMPTION OF PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN INVENTORY DATA AND REFERENCE FLOWS; (2) QUANTIFY INFLUENCES OF FOREGROUND PROCESSES' PARAMETERS (AND, POSSIBLY, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARAMETERS); AND (3) IDENTIFY TRENDS (EITHER INCREASING OR DECREASING) FOR EACH PARAMETER ON EACH INDICATOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MOST FAVORABLE DIRECTION FOR PARAMETRIC VARIATION. THESE OBJECTIVES CAN BE REACHED BY COMBINING FOREGROUND SYSTEM MODELING, A SET OF TWO DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS METHODS (EACH ONE PROVIDING DIFFERENT AND COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION), AND LCA. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF HEMP-BASED INSULATION MATERIALS FOR BUILDINGS. THE PRESENT STUDY WILL FOCUS ON THE AGRICULTURAL STAGE AS A FOREGROUND SYSTEM AND AS A FIRST STEP ENCOMPASSING THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE. A SET OF TECHNOLOGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HEMP FARMERS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE CROP'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (FROM -11\% TO -89\% ACCORDING TO THE CONSIDERED IMPACT CATEGORY). ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS OF THE APPROACH IS THE NEED FOR A DETAILED MODEL OF THE FOREGROUND PROCESS. FURTHER, THE METHOD IS, AT PRESENT, RATHER TIME-CONSUMING. HOWEVER, IT OFFERS LONG-TERM ADVANTAGES GIVEN THAT THE HIGHER LEVEL OF MODEL DETAIL ADDS ROBUSTNESS TO THE LCA RESULTS.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","NANTES UNIVERSITE; UNIVERSITE GUSTAVE-EIFFEL; INRAE; UNIVERSITE DE RENNES",NA,"ANNE.VENTURA@UNIV-NANTES.FR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1111/jiec.12228","CZ3OZ","1530-9290",NA,NA,"FRENCH ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (ADEME); REGION PAYS DE LA LOIRE, FRANCE; CHAMBER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY OF NANTES CITY; CHAMBER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY OF SAINT-NAZAIRE CITY; CARENE (URBAN AGGLOMERATION OF SAINT-NAZAIRE); CHARIER; ARCHITECTES INGENIEURS ASSOCIES; VINCI CONSTRUCTION; EVEA; REGIONAL FEDERATION OF BUILDINGS; REGIONAL FEDERATION OF PUBLIC WORKS","THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE THE FRENCH ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (ADEME) AND THE REGION PAYS DE LA LOIRE, FRANCE, FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THREE ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR THEIR VALUABLE COMMENTS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THESE CONSIDERATIONS ARE NOTORIOUSLY ABSENT IN TODAY'S PRACTICE OWING TO A TRADITIONALLY SEGMENTED APPROACH TO THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT HAS PERPETUATED INTEROPERABILITY CHALLENGES BETWEEN EXISTING COMMERCIAL TOOLS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING APPROACHES, THIS PAPER OFFERS AN INTEGRATED LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (ILCA) THAT (1) CONSIDERS THE EFFECTS OF SITE-SPECIFIC CLIMATE AND EXPOSURE TO WIND AND SEISMIC HAZARDS ON A BUILDING'S EMBODIED AND OPERATING ENERGY, (2) ADOPTS AN ASSEMBLY-BASED APPROACH TO REVEAL THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS INFLUENCING PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES, (3) ACCOMMODATES BOTH RISK-NEUTRAL AND RISK-ADVERSE PERSPECTIVES, AND (4) ADDRESSES INTEROPERABILITY CHALLENGES THAT LIMIT ACCESS TO THE DATA STORED WITHIN COMMERCIAL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS. THE RESULTING ILCA IS PARTITIONED INTO A SUSTAINABILITY WORKFLOW, WITH MODULES DEDICATED TO EMBODIED AND OPERATING ENERGY, AND A RESILIENCE WORKFLOW, SEQUENCING MODULES FOR HAZARD CHARACTERIZATION, STRUCTURAL RESPONSE, DAMAGE, AND REPAIR/LOSS. A CUSTOM PARSER LEVERAGES SEMANTIC TECHNOLOGIES TO EFFICIENTLY EXTRACT GEOMETRY AND MATERIAL INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERLYING DATA STRUCTURES OF REVIT BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS; THIS PARSER ULTIMATELY SUPPLIES THE REQUIRED BUILDING DATA TO EACH MODULE. A UNIFYING PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK IS THEN ADOPTED TO QUANTIFY LIFE-CYCLE PERFORMANCE, IN TERMS OF REPAIR COSTS AND TOTAL (EMBODIED AND OPERATING) ENERGY, WITH EMPHASIS PLACED ON EXPANDING THE STATISTICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF PERFORMANCE TO SUPPORT BOTH RISK-NEUTRAL AND RISK-AVERSE DECISION-MAKING. THE ILCA IS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OFFICE BUILDING AT TWO SITES TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND WIND AND SEISMIC HAZARDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OVER DIFFERENT SERVICE LIVES, INCLUSIVE OF POTENTIAL PERFORMANCE VARIABILITY DUE TO HAZARD EXPOSURE. THE FRAMEWORK IS FURTHER LEVERAGED TO EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY, OR ASSUMPTIONS SURROUNDING THE QUANTIFICATION OF THIS UNCERTAINTY, IMPACT LIFE-CYCLE PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES.

A FRAMEWORK IS DESIGNED TO INCORPORATE BIM, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) TO PERFORM A HOLISTIC COMPARISON OF A SHOTCRETE INSULATED COMPOSITE FACADE (SHOTCRETE ICF), GALVANISED STEEL INSULATED COMPOSITE FACADE (G. STEEL ICF) AND STABILISED EARTH BLOCK FACADE (SEBF) AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE BLOCK AND MORTAR FACADE (CBMF). BIM MODELS ARE DEVELOPED TO COMPUTE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF EACH FACADE. THE RESULTS ARE THEN SUBJECTED TO A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS FOR DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLE STAGES. THE SEBF IS PROVED TO BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FACADE AS IT REDUCES CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND (CED) BY 39.13 \%, GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) BY 18.07 \% AND LCC BY 47.87 \% COMPARED TO CBMF. THE SHOTCRETE IFC AND G. STEEL IFC ARE FOUND TO INCREASE CED BUT DECREASE GWP. OTHER THAN THE SEBF, THE RANKING OF ALL FACADES UNDER DIFFERENT INDICATORS CHANGES THROUGH THE SCENARIO ANALYSIS.

THE DEVELOPED APPROACH CAN SUPPORT AUTOMATED ASSESSMENTS THROUGH ALL LIFECYCLE PHASES OF A PREFABRICATED BUILDING. IT IS ACHIEVED THROUGH AN AUTOMATED PROCESS OF CREATING PARAMETERS TO MERGE LCA DATA INTO THE BUILDING MODEL, SYSTEMATIC ZONING, MODEL SETUP AND IMPACT ESTIMATION. THIS APPROACH IS APPLIED TO EVALUATE THE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCES OF A CASE BUILDING IN HONG KONG. THE CASE STUDY VALIDATED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DEVELOPED BIMBASED LCA METHOD IN PROVIDING A SYSTEMATIC AND DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF MODULARLY DESIGNED BUILDINGS. THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE KNOWLEDGE IN AUTOMATED BIM-BASED LCA BY ADDRESSING SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PREFABRICATION AND PROMOTES THE INCORPORATION OF COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED LCA DATA INTO BIM MODELS FOR IMPROVED DESIGN ROBUSTNESS AND HOLISTIC PERFORMANCES OF BUILDINGS.

AS OF 2021, ONLY 199 RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS WERE LINKED TO AFRICAN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT INVESTIGATIONS HIGHLIGHTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND LACK OF RESEARCH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN 2022 GHANA'S GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE WAS RANKED 170TH OUT OF 180 COUNTRIES, WITH A SCORE OF 27.70 OUT OF 100, SHOWING A TEN-YEAR TREND OF-6.1. THIS STUDY AIMED TO OPTIMISE SINGLE DWELLING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS' MATERIAL EMISSIONS FROM CRADLE TO GATE USING FIRST PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE DYNAMIC LIFE CYCLE ITERATION PROTOCOLS. THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES WERE SET: 1) TO IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY MATERIALS IN A TYPICAL GHANAIAN SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING AND APPLY FIRST PRINCIPLES TO MODEL THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, AND 2) TO REPLACE THE MATERIALS WITH AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TYPE THROUGH ITERATION OPTIMISATION. THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING IN REVIT 2021 WAS USED TO DESIGN AND TAKE OFF QUANTITIES OF THE MATERIALS. THE OPTIMISATION WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH ITERATIONS USING MS EXCEL. THE BASELINE MODEL SHOWED THAT STEEL AND ALUMINIUM PRODUCTS GENERATED FRONTAL RESULTS OF 28.64 TON CO2EQ/M2 AND 1.96 TON CO2EQ/M2, REPRESENTING 92\% AND 6\% OF THE TOTAL GWP100, RESPECTIVELY. A DECREASE OF 39\% IN GWP100 EMISSIONS WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY EMPLOYING CONCRETE BLOCKS INSTEAD OF EXPANDABLE LIGHTWEIGHT CONCRETE CLAY BLOCKS. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT GYPSUM PLASTERBOARD HAD THE LOWEST MATERIAL IMPACT ACROSS THE GWP100, EMITTING 1895.40 KGCO2EQ/M2, OR 0.81 PERCENT CARBON, DURING THE PRODUCTION PHASE. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CAN AID THE MANY REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS IN DEVELOPING NATIONS WHO WANT TO BUILD RESIDENTIAL HOMES USING SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSED BY USING BUILDING MATERIALS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","E01803","NBANSAH@ATU.EDU.GH",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.sciaf.2023.e01803","P4HN6",NA,"JUL 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2468-2276","SCI.

NEVERTHELESS, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE, A BALANCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRITERIA HAS TO BE CREATED. THERE ARE ALREADY DIFFERENT TOOLS AVAILABLE WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REACH THIS GOAL. IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THEM AS SUCH AND FIND OUT HOW THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED TO OBTAIN SYNERGIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION. THESE TOOLS HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN EARLY DESIGN PHASES SO AS TO ADD VALUE TO THE PROJECT. IN THE PRESENT PAPER, TWO POWERFUL METHODS, NAMELY BIM AND LCA, WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED. SUCH METHODS CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY. ON THE ONE HAND, BIM SUPPORTS INTEGRATED DESIGN AND IMPROVES INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT PROJECT LIFE-CYCLE PHASES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LCA IS A SUITABLE METHOD FOR ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. BOTH LCA AND BIM SHOULD BE INTEGRATED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AT AN EARLY STAGE WITH A VIEW TO ACHIEVING A HOLISTIC OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA, FROM THE BEGINNING.

THE COMBINATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT LEADS TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY MEASURES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY REQUIRE COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE AND CLASSIFICATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING USES AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING CAPABILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DESIGNED TO SURVEY EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD. BY EVALUATING THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING CRITERIA AND LIFE CYCLE EVALUATION, USING THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING METHOD, IT WAS FOUND THAT 3D COORDINATION, PHASE PLANNING, AND DESIGN REVIEWS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT.

THE CORE OBJECTIVE IS THE OPTIMIZATION OF MATERIALS USED IN THE BUILDING'S OUTER SHELL TO EFFECTIVELY CURTAIL OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE EMPLOYED BIM MODELING, PARAMETRIC SIMULATIONS WITH THE ENERGY PLUS ENGINE, AND ATHENA TO ASSESS THE EMBODIED ENERGY IN MATERIALS. THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM NSGAII WAS HARNESSED TO DETERMINE THE MOST SUITABLE MATERIALS. THE RESULTS DERIVED FROM THE LCA AND BIM ANALYSES ILLUSTRATE THAT THE SELECTION OF OPTIMAL MATERIALS FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDING FACADES IN IRAN CAN LEAD TO A REMARKABLE 40\% REDUCTION IN ANNUAL AVERAGE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. FURTHERMORE, THIS APPROACH CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO MITIGATING GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP).

THE FINDINGS HAVE REVEALED THAT: (A) THERE IS STILL AN INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS AND READINESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CE PRINCIPLES IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND LCA UNDERSTANDING AND (B) THE ADOPTION OF BIM AT THE EARLY STAGES OF BUILDING DESIGN IS STILL LIMITED IN THE CURRENT PRACTICE; BIM MODELS WITH SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF DATA DETAILS AND QUALITY TO ENABLE CIRCULARITY ASSESSMENT ARE RARELY PRODUCED. THUS, THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR ENABLING MECHANISMS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THE INVOLVEMENT AND COMMITMENT OF THE INDUSTRY AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS, THE SUPPORT FOR TRAINING AND SKILLS IMPROVEMENT, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS. FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA POINTS TO THE NEED OF FORMULATION OF A BIM PROTOCOL TO ENABLE INTEGRATION OF BIM AND LCA TO PROMOTE CE PRINCIPLES IN THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF LONDON; UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON; UNIVERSITY OF LONDON; UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON; CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS (CSIC); UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA; CSIC-UPV - INSTITUTO DE GESTION DE LA INNOVACION Y DEL CONOCIMIENTO (INGENIO)","142803","SEYMA.ATIK.16@UCL.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142803","UZ0I1","1879-1786","JUN 2024",NA,"REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MIN- ISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION","THE PHD RESEARCH HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MIN- ISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION.

THE QUANTITY OF BUILDING MATERIALS USED AND BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATIONS WERE ANALYZED FOR EACH BLOCK TYPE USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TECHNIQUES, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN LCCO2 EMISSION WERE CALCULATED BY CONSIDERING HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE ALTERNATIVES. BY CHANGING THE BEARING WALL SYSTEM OF THE `FLAT-TYPE' BLOCK TO THE `COLUMN AND BEAM' SYSTEM OF THE `T-TYPE' BLOCK, LCCO2 EMISSIONS OF THE ALTERNATIVE CASE WERE 4299 KG-CO2/M(2), OF WHICH 26\% WAS AT THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE, 73\% WAS AS THE OPERATIONAL STAGE AND 1\% WAS AT THE DISMANTLING AND DISPOSAL STAGE.

HOWEVER, DURING ITS LIFETIME, A BUILDING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ITS IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS; HENCE, ITS LIFECYCLE MUST NOT BE MANAGED IN ISOLATION AS A SINGLE ENTITY WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS. BLM MUST CONSIDER IN WHAT WAY SURROUNDINGS INFLUENCE LIFECYCLE AND HOW A BUILDING IMPACTS ITS SURROUNDINGS. THE USE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) HAS BEEN REPORTED IN A RANGE OF STUDIES FOR SUPPORTING VARIOUS TASKS OF BUILDING LIFECYCLE IN WHICH BIM IS LACKING. UNDERSTANDING THE PARTICIPATION OF A BUILDING IN ITS SURROUNDINGS IS ALSO DONE BY USING GIS, HOWEVER POTENTIAL USE OF GIS IN THE ENTIRE LIFECYCLE OF A BUILDING HAS NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED. THE REVIEW OF LITERATURE PRODUCED A LIST OF APPLICATION AREAS OF BIM AND GIS WHICH MAY POSSIBLY IMPROVE EXISTING BLM PROCESSES, SPECIFICALLY, THE POSSIBLE WAYS TO CONSIDER SURROUNDINGS, SITE CONSTRAINTS, LOCATIONAL EFFECTS, AND SERVICES OF NEARBY FACILITIES/UTILITIES. AN INTERACTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY USING THE MAIN APPLICATION AREAS OF BIM AND GIS SEAMLESSLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF BLM, ENABLING DATA REUSE IN ALL STAGES, DEVELOPING EFFICIENT DESIGNS AND PLANS, AND MAKING SUSTAINABLE DECISIONS. THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK WAS USED FOR THE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUILDING PROJECT TAKEN AS A CASE STUDY. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE APPLICATION AREAS OF BOTH BIM AND GIS HAVE A COORDINATED SOLUTION TO MAKES BLM A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE.

HOWEVER, DESIGNERS ARE FACED WITH MANY DECISIONS DURING THESE STAGES AND TYPICALLY LACK INTUITION ON WHICH DECISIONS ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO A BUILDING'S IMPACT. AS A RESULT, DESIGNERS OFTEN DEFER DECISIONS TO LATER STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CAN BE USED TO ENABLE BETTER EARLY STAGE DECISION-MAKING BY PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) DESIGN CHOICES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD FOR APPLYING LCA TO EARLY STAGE DECISION-MAKING IN ORDER TO INFORM DESIGNERS OF THE RELATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING COMPONENT MATERIAL AND DIMENSIONING CHOICES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO GENERALIZE THE METHOD ACROSS A RANGE OF BUILDING SHAPES AND DESIGN PARAMETERS. AN IMPACT ALLOCATION SCHEME IS DEVELOPED THAT SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF EMBODIED IMPACTS AMONG BUILDING ELEMENTS, AND AN IMPACT REDUCTION SCHEME SHOWS WHICH MATERIAL AND THICKNESS DECISIONS ACHIEVE THE GREATEST EMBODIED IMPACT REDUCTIONS. A MULTI-BUILDING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IS USED AS A CASE STUDY FOR INTRODUCING THE PROPOSED METHOD TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE METHOD CAN ASSIST IN THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS BY HIGHLIGHTING THOSE EARLY STAGE DECISIONS THAT FREQUENTLY ACHIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EMBODIED CARBON FOOTPRINT.

THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL FOR OPTIMIZATION AND REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS LIES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. THEREFORE, A DESIGN-INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR LCA IS NEEDED. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PARAMETRIC LCA TOOL FOR APPLICATION IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES IN THE SWISS CONTEXT. THE ENVISIONED USERS OF THE TOOL ARE PRIMARILY ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING STUDENTS, BUT ALSO PRACTITIONERS. THE INTEGRATION OF LCA THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS IS SOLVED THROUGH A MODULAR STRATEGY. IN THE EARLY STAGE, PRE-DEFINED COMPONENTS ARE SELECTED TO MODEL A COMPLETE LCA. IN THE FOLLOWING DESIGN STEPS WHEN MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE, INDIVIDUAL MATERIALS CAN BE INPUT WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF DETAIL. THE BOMBYX TOOL IS DEVELOPED AS A PLUGIN FOR GRASSHOPPER BASED ON RHINOCEROS3D AND INCLUDES AN SQL MATERIAL AND COMPONENT DATABASE. USERS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND BUILDING SYSTEMS AND QUICKLY MODIFY THE BUILDING'S GEOMETRY WHILE CONTINUOUSLY RECEIVING THE CALCULATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IN REAL-TIME. VISUALIZATION OF THE RESULTS, E.G. COLOUR CODE INDICATE HOW THE DESIGN PERFORMS IN RELATION TO A BENCHMARK OR OPTIMIZATION POTENTIAL. THE PROJECT IS DEVELOPED IN OPEN SOURCE TO BROADEN THE USER AND DEVELOPER COMMUNITY AND FOSTER NEW IDEAS, DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENTATIONS IN BOMBYX.","DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN; ETH ZURICH","012112","BASIC@IBI.BAUG.ETHZ.CH",NA,"SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT D-A-CH CONFERENCE 2019 (SBE19 GRAZ)","2024-12-23","10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012112","BP7IP",NA,NA,"PASSER, A AND LUTZKENDORF, T AND HABERT, G AND KROMPKOLB, H AND MONSBERGER, M","INNOVEDUM FUND OF ETH ZURICH","WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE INNOVEDUM FUND OF ETH ZURICH FOR SUPPORTING FOR THIS PROJECT.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SUGGESTED VIRTUAL ENERGY LABORATORY WHERE THE INVOLVED MULTIPLE PLAYERS CAN MONITOR THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF A FACILITY IN ALL PHASES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE BY EXAMINING SIMULTANEOUSLY VARIOUS CLIMATIC, USAGE AND DESIGN VARIATIONS. TO ENABLE SUCH SIMULATION STUDIES THE VIRTUAL LABORATORY WILL PROVIDE FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF PARALLEL COMPUTATIONS WITH VARYING SIMULATION PARAMETERS FROM PRODUCT DATA CATALOGUES, CLIMATE DATA, USER PROFILES AND BIM MODEL DATA USING CLOUD TECHNOLOGY. MOREOVER, IT WILL ALSO ALLOW EXAMINING ENERGY RELEVANT PRODUCT COMPONENTS LIKE HVAC EQUIPMENT OR FACADE ELEMENTS IN DIFFERENT VIRTUAL BUILDING SCENARIOS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING SIMULATIONS OF THE SAME COMPONENT ON DIFFERENT BIM DATA OR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

FORMAL CHECKING OF BUILT ASSETS AGAINST REGULATIONS HAPPENS AT DEFINED POINTS IN THEIR LIFE-CYCLE, AND OFTEN THERE IS LIMITED AUTOMATION INVOLVED. THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS DIGITISING AND AUTOMATION ELEMENTS OF PHYSICAL SITE INSPECTIONS PAVES THE WAY TOWARDS A WHOLE LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH FOR COMPLIANCE CHECKING. THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHOLE LIFE-CYCLE COMPLIANCE CHECKING. IT DOES THIS BY EXTENDING CURRENT CHECKING PROCESSES WHICH ARE COMMON IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES INTO THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF THE BUILDING LIFE-CYCLE, PROPOSING THAT THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS THROUGH AUTOMATED/SEMI-AUTOMATED DATA CAPTURE AND ANALYSIS. TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT, THIS PAPER WILL REVIEW EXISTING ACADEMIC LITERATURE, ANALYSE EXISTING REGULATIONS AND CONDUCT PROOF OF CONCEPT TESTING. THIS PAPER HAS FOUND THAT THE CONCEPT OF WHOLE-LIFECYCLE COMPLIANCE CHECKING IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO BETTER MONITOR AND ASSURE HIGH RISKS ELEMENTS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WHEN APPLIED TO THE OPERATIONAL PHASE, IT, HOWEVER, BECOMES IMPRACTICAL AND EXPENSIVE WHEN RELYING ON SOLELY MANUAL INSPECTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF VIABLE USE CASES FOR THIS APPROACH AND THAT THERE ARE VIABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO LEVERAGE THEM.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY",NA,"BEACHTH@CARDIFF.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15623599.2024.2366727","YL3R5","2331-2327","JUN 2024",NA,"TRANSFORMING CONSTRUCTION NETWORK PLUS","NO STATEMENT AVAILABLE",NA,"1562-3599","INT.

HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF VM AND ITS INTEGRATION AS PART OF THE WLC IN A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT REMAIN REACTIVE, AND HIGHLY IMPACTED BY NATURE OF THE PROJECT, AND THIS HAS BECOME MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE EPIDEMIC IMPACT OF COVID-19. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISMS THAT DELIVERS VALUE MANAGEMENT AS PART OF THE ``RE-INVENT'' STRATEGY PROPOSED BY THE CONSTRUCTION LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IN THE UK GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE WLC FOR BUILDINGS. IN ADDITION TO EXISTING SECONDARY DATA FROM THE LITERATURE, PRIMARY DATA WERE ATTAINED USING A FOCUS GROUP WITH SIX QUANTITY SURVEYORS FROM DIFFERENT COST CONSULTANCIES IN THE UK TO GATHER QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE USING THEIR EXPERIENCES, PERCEPTIONS, AND KEY CHALLENGES THEY FACE WHEN INTEGRATING VM. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT VALUE MANAGEMENT IS PRIMARILY BEING USED AS A COST-CUTTING TOOL, THE MAJORITY OF QUANTITY SURVEYORS LACK KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT ENCOMPASSES, HENCE THE INDUSTRY NEEDS A MORE PROACTIVE STRATEGY TOWARDS IT. ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT VALUE MANAGEMENT IS PRIMARILY IMPLEMENTED AS A COST-CUTTING SOLUTION, KEY STAKEHOLDERS (E.G., FACILITY MANAGERS) NEED TO BE INTEGRATED, AND THERE IS NO STANDARDISED PROCESS TO INCORPORATE VALUE MANAGEMENT IN PROJECTS. THE STUDY PROPOSES A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL (GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES, SUSTAINABILITY, INDUSTRY'S BEST PRACTICE, AND INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY) STRATEGY TO FACILITATE MORE HOLISTIC CONSIDERATIONS OF VALUE MANAGEMENT POST COVID-19.

HOWEVER, THE USE OF BIM AND IPD IN PROJECTS DOES NOT ALWAYS IMPLY THAT THE INFORMATION IS WELL USED AND MANAGED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLAIN HOW INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN BIM AND IPD PROJECTS, WHAT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE MANAGED BY THE INFORMATION MANAGER AND WHICH STAKEHOLDER SHOULD PLAY THIS ROLE AND WHY? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK ON THE SUBJECT BY CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN THE FIELD OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT, BIM, IPD AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS DATABASES HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED, N = 45 OUT OF A TOTAL OF N = 1,356 ARTICLES AND ADDITIONALLY, THE BIM DOCUMENTS AND STANDARDS PREPARED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND INDUSTRY REPORTS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED IN DETAIL. FINDINGS THE FRAMEWORK FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ROLES WAS ESTABLISHED BY REVIEWING THE LITERATURE. ACCORDING TO THIS FRAMEWORK, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES OF INFORMATION MANAGERS ARE LISTED IN THE TABLE THAT COVERS ALL PHASES OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. THE OWNER SHOULD UNDERTAKE THIS ROLE AS IT IS THE ENTITY THAT OVERSEES THE BUILT ASSET FROM PLANNING TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT FACILITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE IN TERMS OF ACQUIRING INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ROLES, THERE IS NO RESEARCH ON BIM AND IPD PROJECTS AND WHO WILL TAKE OVER THIS ROLE.

AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING FUTURE OPERATION AND DEMOLITION COSTS EMPHASISES THE SHORTCOMINGS RELATED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ACCURATE PREDICTIONS/ESTIMATIONS OF SUCH COSTS, WHICH WILL BECOME APPARENT IN THE FUTURE. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP, AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH OF LIFE-CYCLE COST MODELLING ON THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURES OF THE BUILDING IS PRESENTED. THE MODEL PROVIDES USERS WITH INFORMATION ON THE COSTS OF AVAILABLE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INVESTOR AT A SPECIFIC STAGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. IN THIS WAY, IT HELPS INVESTORS OPTIMISE THEIR BUILDING PROJECTS AND TO FIND THE MOST ECONOMICAL SOLUTIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS MODEL IS ASSEMBLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELECTING A SUITABLE PARTITION WALL AND, THEREFORE, IT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS RELATING TO THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF STRUCTURE. THE RESULTS INDICATE DIVERSITY IN PARTITION WALL STRUCTURAL DESIGN VARIANTS AT THE EARLY STAGE OF THE PROJECT. SINCE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE FUTURE COSTS DECREASES AS THE PROJECT PROGRESSES, THE MODEL ALLOWS CAPTURING LCC PERSPECTIVE EVEN IF ONLY A CONSTRUCTION STUDY IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT MORE DETAILED TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC INFORMATION.

TO DATE, BSMS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATIONAL LIFE-CYCLE IMPACTS OF DOMESTIC DWELLINGS; THERE HAS BEEN LESS EMPHASIS EITHER ON NON-DOMESTIC BUILDINGS (NDBS) OR FULL LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A FIRST REVIEW OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NDB STOCK MODELLING WHICH CONSIDERS LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY, EMISSIONS AND COSTS. A META-ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE WAS UNDERTAKEN INVOLVING A STRUCTURED SEARCH OF RELEVANT ARTICLES IN KEY SCIENTIFIC REPOSITORIES. 98 IN-SCOPE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED AND DATA COLLECTED ON THEIR AIMS AND OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGIES, DATA SOURCES, SYSTEM BOUNDARIES, CONSIDERED IMPACTS, REPRESENTATIVENESS, UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS, VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION TECHNIQUES, FURTHER RESEARCH IDENTIFIED, MODEL TRANSPARENCY AND SOFTWARE TOOLS EMPLOYED. THE REVIEW NECESSITATED THE CLASSIFICATION OF MODELLING METHODOLOGIES. THE EXISTING `BOTTOM-UP' AND `TOP-DOWN' GROUPS WERE FOUND TO BE AMBIGUOUS AND LED TO CONFUSION. THEREFORE, AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY CLASSIFICATION IS PROPOSED, CONSIDERING BOTH THE MODELLING TECHNIQUE AND MODEL SIMULATION DATA USED. THE FINDINGS OF THE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT MOST APPROACHES USE ENGINEERING MODELS EMPLOYING ARCHETYPE DATA. HOWEVER, ALMOST ALL CURRENT LIFE-CYCLE MODELS OF NDB STOCKS ARE INCOMPLETE. ONLY ONE STUDY CONSIDERED THE FULL BUILDING LIFE-CYCLE AND MOST DID NOT INCLUDE UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS. THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF STUDY RESULTS IS POOR SINCE MOST DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENTLY-DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE MODELS AND DATA USED. CRITICALLY, THERE IS A LACK OF REPRESENTATIVE INPUT DATA WHICH LIMITS THEIR USEFULNESS AS EVIDENCE IN POLICYMAKING.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",NA,"111743","J.BISCHOF@IWU.DE AIDAN.DUFFY@TUDUBLIN.IE",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.rser.2021.111743","WR4EC","1879-0690","OCT 2021",NA,"INSTITUT FOR HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENT (INSTITUT WOHNEN UND UMWELT (IWU))","MANY THANKS GO TO THE INSTITUT FOR HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENT (INSTITUT WOHNEN UND UMWELT (IWU)) FOR SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT.",NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

DESPITE THEIR GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE, LAND USE IMPACTS ARE STILL RARELY ADDRESSED, ALTHOUGH METHODS FOR INTEGRATING LAND USE INTO LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED RECENTLY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND CALCULATION OF REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS BASED ON THE LANCA (R) (LAND USE INDICATOR VALUE CALCULATION IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT) METHOD TO BE INTEGRATED INTO LCA USING A GEO INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS). METHODS WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE LANCA (R) CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS (BOS ET AL. 2016), LAND USE IMPACTS CAN BE ASSESSED AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. HOWEVER, SOIL PARAMETERS AS WELL AS CLIMATIC CONDITIONS CHANGE ON A SMALL SCALE AND ARE VERY SITE-SPECIFIC. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS. AFTER A LITERATURE REVIEW, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIVE LANCA (R) INDICATORS. AFTERWARDS WE PRESENT THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE CALCULATION OF GIS-BASED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS AND APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO TWO EXAMPLES, THE INDICATORS OF MECHANICAL FILTRATION AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL FILTRATION. FINALLY, WE APPLY THE CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN A CASE STUDY. RESULTS, APPLICATION AND DISCUSSION THE REGION-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS ARE CALCULATED IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT YIELDING A MAP WITH VALUES FOR MECHANICAL FILTRATION AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL FILTRATION PER GRID CELL FOR VARIOUS LAND USE TYPES. A CASE STUDY SHOWS THAT LAND USE IMPACTS FLUCTUATE DUE TO SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS PEDOLOGICAL, TOPOGRAPHICAL AND CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT OUR CALCULATION OF REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN GLOBAL MAPS IS FEASIBLE AND FACILITATES AN AREA'S POTENTIAL FOR CAUSING LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR A CERTAIN LAND USE COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS. REMAINING CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO INPUT DATA QUALITY, THE COMPREHENSIBILITY OF THE RESULTS TO PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE NOT LAND USE EXPERTS AND THE TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS OF LCA DATABASE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. CONCLUSIONS THROUGH THE PRESENTED REGIONALIZATION OF THE LANCA (R) FRAMEWORK, A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO METHOD ADVANCEMENT IS MET AS ALSO REGION-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS CAN NOW BE CALCULATED. IN COMPARISON TO THE PUBLISHED COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN BOS ET AL. (2016), THE DEVELOPED REGIONAL GIS-BASED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS ARE FAR MORE ADVANTAGEOUS ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS, IT HAS TO BE NOTED THAT AN LCA INCLUDING THE EVALUATION OF LAND USE DOES NOT REPLACE METHODS AND TOOLS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. WHEN DECIDING ON A PREFERABLE LOCATION FOR A SPECIFIC LAND USE NATURE CONSERVATION, GEOGRAPHICAL, GEOLOGICAL AND BUILDING LAW ASPECTS MUST ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART; FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT; TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN",NA,"UBOS@SPHERA.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-020-01730-y","MU9JB","1614-7502","FEB 2020",NA,"ERICH RITTER FOUNDATION","THIS WORK HAS BEEN PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE ERICH RITTER FOUNDATION.

IN THIS STUDY, TWO ENDPOINT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODS ARE APPLIED: RECIPE 2016 AND IMPACT WORLD + TO ASSESS A CONVENTIONAL ROOF AND THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GREEN ROOFS. AS LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) DATA ABOUT URBAN PLANTS ARE MISSING, WE CREATED NEW DATA TO MODEL THE VEGETATION LAYER OF GREEN ROOFS BY COLLECTING INFORMATION NEARBY PLANTS NURSERY. THIS WORK SHOWS THAT 1) EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOF GENERATES THE LEAST BIODIVERSITY LOSS, 2) ``EX SITU'' BIODIVERSITY IS 10 TIMES MORE IMPACTED THAN ``IN SITU'' BIODIVERSITY, 3) THE IMPACT OF THE VEGETATION LAYER ON THE BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS SIGNIFICANT. LCA METHODS DO NOT ENABLE TO COVER ALL PRESSURES THREATENING BIODIVERSITY AND THEY ALSO LACK PRECISION TO ASSESS ``IN SITU'' BIODIVERSITY. NEVERTHELESS, THEIR MAIN STRENGTH IS TO CONSIDER ``EX SITU'' BIODIVERSITY ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN OF THE STUDIED SYSTEMS. COUPLING LCA WITH ECOLOGICAL EXPERTISE SHOULD IMPROVE THE ASSESSMENT BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL SPECIFICITIES AND BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS OF A SYSTEM (E.G. ``IN SITU'' BIODIVERSITY GAINS WITH GREEN ROOFS).","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","COMMUNAUTE UNIVERSITE GRENOBLE ALPES; UNIVERSITE GRENOBLE ALPES (UGA); MUSEUM NATIONAL D'HISTOIRE NATURELLE (MNHN)",NA,"ALINE.BRACHET@CSTB.FR NICOLETA.SCHIOPU@CSTB.FR CLERGEAU@MNHN.FR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.014","HZ5LW","1873-684X",NA,NA,"PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITIES OF MARNE-LA-VALLEE; SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CENTER FOR BUILDING","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITIES OF MARNE-LA-VALLEE AND THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CENTER FOR BUILDING.",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS BLOCKCHAIN AND THEINTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PILLARS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS REVOLUTION. THE INTEGRATION OF DECENTRALISED NETWORKS AND AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A PIVOTAL FACTOR IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN SUPPLY CHAIN ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE OFF-SITE MANUFACTURING FIELD. OBSTACLES RELATED TO FRAGMENTED INFORMATION, INTEROPERABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND ``BIG DATA'' MANAGEMENT ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR CHANGE THAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO ADDRESS. WHILST ORGANISATIONS AND USERS CAN AUTOMATE WORKFLOWS AND PROCESSES BY UTILISING IOT TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFER DATA WITHOUT HUMAN-TO-HUMAN OR HUMAN-TO-COMPUTER INTERACTION, THE INTERACTION, STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE DATA GENERATED ARE NOT SAFE OR RELIABLE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE APPROACH OUTLINED IN THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGES THAT IOT AND CENTRALISED NETWORKS PRESENT. BLOCKCHAIN, A PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTED DATABASE, OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN THE ASSET INFORMATION WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS IN ALL THE STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE. THE SYNERGY BETWEEN THESE TECHNOLOGIES, ALONG WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES, METHODS AND PLATFORMS (SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM)), BASED ON A SINGLE ENVIRONMENT, WILL SUPPORT INFORMATION TRACEABILITY FROM THE STRATEGIC DEFINITION TO END OF LIFE. FINDINGS THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY NEW WORKFLOWS AND PROCESSES WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROTOCOLS. IT BENEFITS FROM A WELL-ESTABLISHED PLATFORM SUCH AS BIM TO ENABLE THE COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIGITAL ASSETS AS WELL AS GIVING ILLUSTRATION AND COLLABORATION TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN MEMBERS. IOT AND BLOCKCHAIN ARE THE OTHER LAYERS THAT WORK TOGETHER WITH THE THIRD LAYER (BIM). THIS FRAMEWORK PROPOSED THE USE OF THESE PLATFORMS TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION TRACEABILITY OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL ASSETS, DATA AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, IN A DYNAMIC SUPPLY CHAIN ECOSYSTEM, BRINGING EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY TO STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK TO BE USED BY THE SUPPLY CHAIN MEMBERS IN OFFSITE MANUFACTURING, AND THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, TO TRACK ASSET INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE SECURELY AND TRANSPARENTLY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF IOT, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BIM USE IN OFFSITE MANUFACTURING UNDER THE AEC INDUSTRY.

YET, AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THESE DECISIONS IS OFTEN LIMITED, OR DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND PARTICULARLY REGARDING SUSTAINABILITY. EFFECTIVE WAYS OF COMMUNICATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS ARE REQUIRED TO CLOSE THIS GAP. WHILE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IS AN ESTABLISHED TOOL TO EVALUATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION-MAKING, THE RESULTS ARE TYPICALLY STANDARDIZED AND BASED ON STATISTICAL OR AVERAGED DATA. HOWEVER, FOR INDIVIDUALS, THIS INFORMATION MIGHT BE IRRELEVANT, AS IT NEGLECTS PERSONAL SITUATION, BEHAVIOR, INFORMATION NEED, OR INDIVIDUAL LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. IN TACKLING THOSE CENTRAL ISSUES OF PERSONALIZATION IN LCA, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON TWO MAIN QUESTIONS: HOW CAN INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS BE ADDRESSED IN LCA AND AT WHICH STAGES OF THE METHODOLOGY CAN LCA BE PERSONALIZED? FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE ISO 14040/44 STANDARDS ARE ANALYZED REGARDING INDIVIDUALITY, AND CURRENT APPROACHES IN LITERATURE ARE PRESENTED. IN AN EXPLORATIVE APPROACH, THIS RESEARCH IDENTIFIES TWO GENERAL APPROACHES OF PERSONALIZING LCA.

LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT IS USED BY DESIGNERS, ARCHITECTS, MANUFACTURERS, AND CONSULTANTS FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES: ECO-DESIGN, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING DGNB DK, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPD). THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE THE CURRENT ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES OF PERFORMING LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE-CYCLE COSTING (LCC) CALCULATIONS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR BASED ON THE RESULTS OF 41 SURVEY RESPONSES AND 110 INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2016 AND 2017. THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT 86.5\% OF RESPONDENTS BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) IN THE AUTOMATION OF LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT CALCULATIONS WILL ALLOW LCA TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY DURING THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS. ALSO, ACCORDING TO OUR INTERVIEWEES, THE INTEGRATION OF LCA AND LCC IS A CONSIDERED VALUABLE APPROACH FOR BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY BUT IT IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS.

MOREOVER, SIMPLIFICATIONS ON THESE TOOLS MAY PROVIDE MISLEADING RESULTS TO THE DESIGNER. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATION INTERFACE OF MANUFACTURER-BASED LCA DATA INTO A BIM PLATFORM BY COMBINING APPLICATIONS OF EXISTING AND CONSOLIDATED TOOLS (NAMELY, AUTODESK REVIT AND DYNAMO, AND MICROSOFT EXCEL), IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILES FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE INITIAL DESIGN STAGES, REQUIRING LESS TIME, EFFORT AND AD HOC EXPERTS. THE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES WERE AGGREGATED INTO THE FOLLOWING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PHASES: (A) INPUT DATA ORGANIZATION, (B) CREATING NEW PARAMETERS ON BIM SOFTWARE, (C) VISUAL PROGRAMMING, (D) RESULTS ANALYSIS FOR DECISION-MAKING AND (E) SIMULATION OF SOCIAL HOUSING. THE RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPED TOOL PROVIDED COMPLETE RESULTS AUTOMATICALLY, NOT REQUIRING THE DESIGNER TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE SOFTWARE OR INTERFACES. SOME LIMITATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION, DUE TO THE LACK OF LCA DATA AVAILABILITY BY MANUFACTURERS, THE COMPLEXITY OF DATA PROGRAMMING IMPORTATION AND EXTRACTION ON BIM SOFTWARE FOR DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION SUBSYSTEMS, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF LCA RESULTS ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING ENCOUNTERED BY NON-EXPERTS.

AT PRESENT, INTEREST IN REDUCING THESE EMISSIONS HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS TOOLS TO QUANTIFY, EVALUATE AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. AMONG THE BETTER-KNOWN ONES, LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS (LCA) IS FREQUENTLY LINKED TO BIM MODELLING. THE CITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 75\% OF CARBON EMISSIONS, FOR THAT REASON, THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYSE WHETHER URBAN CONCENTRATION OF HIGH-RISE BLOCKS. USING THE GIS TOOL TO GEOGRAPHICALLY VISUALIZE THE URBAN SYSTEM OF THE STUDY AREA, THE MAIN DISPLACEMENT ROUTES WERE LOCATED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF TRANSPORT USED AND THE LOCATION OF TWO STUDY SITES IN THE HYPERCENTRE OF QUITO CONSIDERED AS POINTS OF ORIGIN FOR THESE TRIPS. THESE DATA WERE ENTERED IN SEVERAL TABLES TO ASCERTAIN THE OVERALL IMPACT IN THE USE PHASE AT CITY LEVEL. THE IMPACT OF THE BUILDING IN THE PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION, DE-CONSTRUCTION AND RECYCLING PHASES WAS ADDED AT A LATER STAGE. THE USE OF THE THREE TOOLS -LCA, BIM AND GIS -ALLOWED US TO ESTABLISH THAT THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF IMPACTS OCCURS IN THE USE PHASE, GIVEN THE HIGH CONSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL ENERGY. FINALLY, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT IN QUITO, A CITY MODEL CONCENTRATED IN HEIGHT, DISPLAYS LESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT COMPARED TO UNCONTROLLED URBAN EXTENSION. IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO LOCALLY IMPLEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS THE ECO-EFFICIENCY MATRIX, WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA","135485",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135485","E4HW1","1879-1786","DEC 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-6526","J.

HOWEVER, SUCH FACTS HAVE SHIFTED A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM THE OPERATION TO THE PRODUCT AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. THUS, THE NEED TO EVALUATE AND SELECT MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONS ARISES, TO ALSO MINIMIZE IMPACTS FROM THESE STAGES. TO EVALUATE THOSE IMPACTS, LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS ARE USUALLY APPLIED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING IMPACTS AND COSTS, THROUGH THE DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLE STAGES. DESPITE THE USEFULNESS OF LCA AND LCC METHODS DURING THE PROJECT PHASE, THEY ARE USUALLY EVALUATED IN THE PROJECT LATER STAGES. IT IS TOO COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING TO GATHER AND PROCESS ALL THE REQUIRED DATA DURING THE PROJECT EARLY STAGES. WITH THE RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF BIM, THE OPPORTUNITY TO AUTOMATE AND SHIFT LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS TO PROJECT EARLY STAGES STANDS OUT. FACING THE RESEARCH GAP, THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A BIM-BASED DECISION-MAKING TOOL FOR DESIGNERS TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONS. TO DO SO, 18 DIFFERENT SIMULATION SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN AUTODESK REVIT WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF EXTERNAL WALLS, ROOFS, AND FLOORS. THEN, A FRAMEWORK WAS DEVELOPED IN DYNAMO TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE THE BUILDING ELEMENTS LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS, AS WELL AS TO AUTOMATE THE LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS DURING THE PROJECT EARLY STAGES. THE OUTCOMES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE REQUIRED TIME, ERRORS AND EFFORTS WHEN PERFORMING LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS, PROVIDING DESIGNERS WITH REAL TIME DECISION SUPPORT DATA AND MAKING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE USE OF BIM FOR SUSTAINABILITY PURPOSES.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSIDADE DO MINHO; UNIVERSIDADE DO MINHO","8914","JPCARVALHO@CIVIL.UMINHO.PT FSVPROJETOS@GMAIL.COM BRAGANCA@CIVIL.UMINHO.PT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su13168914","UH8HU","2071-1050",NA,NA,"PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THROUGH THE REGIONAL OPERATION PROGRAMME OF NORTH [SFRH/BD/145735/2019]; FUNDAÇÃO PARA A CIÊNCIA E A TECNOLOGIA [SFRH/BD/145735/2019] FUNDING SOURCE: FCT","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THROUGH THE REGIONAL OPERATION PROGRAMME OF NORTH (GRANT NUMBER SFRH/BD/145735/2019).",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","AUG",NA,"38","16","GOLD","BRAGANCA, LUIS/0000-0003-4246-8157 CARVALHO, JOSE PEDRO/0000-0001-8759-0223",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","BRAGANCA, LUIS/A-7009-2013 ",NA,25,"ASSESSING LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONS WITH BIM","ARTICLE","WOS000690165400001","4","43","13","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"CARVALHO JOSE PEDRO;VILLASCHI FERNANDA SCHMITD;BRAGANCA LUIS","CARVALHO, JP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MINHO, INST SUSTAINABIL \& INNOVAT STRUCT ENGN ISISE, P-4800058 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","UNIV MINHO;UNIV MINHO;VILLASCHI;UNIV MINHO","UNIV MINHO",NA,"CARVALHO JP, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY","CARVALHO JP, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE TOPIC OF BIM/GIS INTEGRATION WITH THE ADOPTION OF ONTOLOGIES AND METAMODELS, PROVIDING A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE. ONTOLOGIES AND METAMODELS SHARE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES AND COULD BE COMBINED FOR POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS BIM/GIS INTEGRATION FOR COMPLEX TASKS, SUCH AS ASSET MANAGEMENT, WHERE HETEROGENEOUS SOURCES OF DATA ARE INVOLVED. THE RESEARCH ADOPTS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW (SLR), PROVIDING A FORMAL APPROACH TO RETRIEVE SCIENTIFIC PAPERS FROM DEDICATED ONLINE DATABASES. THE RESULTS FOUND ARE THEN ANALYSED, IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THE ART AND SUGGEST FUTURE RESEARCH PATHS, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR BOTH RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS. FROM THE SLR, IT EMERGED THAT SEVERAL STUDIES ADDRESS ONTOLOGIES AS A PROMISING WAY TO OVERCOME THE SEMANTIC BARRIERS OF THE BIM/GIS INTEGRATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, METAMODELS (AND MDE AND MDA APPROACHES, IN GENERAL) ARE RARELY FOUND IN RELATION TO THE INTEGRATION TOPIC. MOREOVER, THE JOINT APPLICATION OF ONTOLOGIES AND METAMODELS FOR BIM/GIS APPLICATIONS IS AN UNEXPLORED FIELD. THE NOVELTY OF THIS WORK IS THE PROPOSAL OF THE JOINT APPLICATION OF ONTOLOGIES AND METAMODELS TO PERFORM BIM/GIS INTEGRATION, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE (CNR); UNIVERSITY OF SALENTO","766","GIUSEPPE.CELESTE@UNISALENTO.IT MARIANGELA.LAZOI@UNISALENTO.IT MATTIA.MANGIA@UNISALENTO.IT GIOVANNA.MANGIALARDI@UNISALENTO.IT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su14020766","YN5CF","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JAN",NA,"90","2","GOLD","MANGIA, MATTIA/0000-0001-7479-1464",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","LAZOI, MARIANGELA/AAQ-8275-2021 MANGIALARDI, GIOVANNA/LSJ-3898-2024 ",NA,9,"INNOVATING THE CONSTRUCTION LIFE CYCLE THROUGH BIM/GIS INTEGRATION: A REVIEW","ARTICLE","WOS000747275800001","11","108","14","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2022,"CELESTE GIUSEPPE;LAZOI MARIANGELA;MANGIA MATTIA; MANGIALARDI GIOVANNA","MANGIA, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SALENTO, DEPT INNOVAT ENGN, I-73100 LECCE, ITALY","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","UNIV SALENTO;CNR;UNIV SALENTO","UNIV SALENTO",NA,"CELESTE G, 2022, SUSTAINABILITY","CELESTE G, 2022, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

THIS CULTURE IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY A ``LINEAR WORKFLOW''THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN LOW EFFICIENCY, DELAYS, REWORK AND UNNECESSARY WASTE. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES BY CREATING A DECENTRALISED AND TRANSPARENT SYSTEM, WHERE ALL THE ACTORS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO A SHARED DATABASE, IT ALLOWS TRACKING AND MONITORS THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE PROJECT, AND EVEN AUTOMATE SOME PROCESSES INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING DELAYS AND REWORK. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE ADVANTAGES OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY HOW IT CAN PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR PROJECT DATA WHILE ALLOWING MULTIPLE PARTIES TO ACCESS AND SHARE DATA IN A SECURE AND TRANSPARENT WAY, IMPROVING THE WORKFLOW OF BIM PROJECTS AND DECREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES. THE PAPER EXPLORES THE INTEGRATION OF BIM AND BLOCKCHAIN ACROSS LIFE CYCLE AND SUPPLY CHAINS BASED ON THE RIBA PLAN OF WORK, WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO STREAMLINE COLLABORATION WHILE IMPROVING PROCESS EFFICIENCY AND RESOURCE TRACEABILITY IN PROJECTS. THE STUDY PROPOSES A ROADMAP PERFORMING A DETAILED LITERATURE SURVEY FOR BLOCKCHAIN ADOPTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, AND VALIDATED ON A REAL-WORLD BRIDGE PROJECT. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY IS INNOVATIVE SINCE IT EXAMINES THE INTEGRATION OF BIM AND BLOCKCHAIN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROJECT LIFECYCLE BY SIMULATING THE SMART CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON THE RIBA PLAN OF WORK, THUS PROVIDING AN IN-DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS INTEGRATION.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY","103886","CELIKY@CARDIFF.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.compind.2023.103886","A6TN6","1872-6194","MAR 2023",NA,"REPUBLIC OF TURKIYE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION","YASIN CELIK WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE REPUBLIC OF TURKIYE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP.",NA,"0166-3615","COMPUT.

NEVERTHELESS, A LACK OF EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION ON THEIR INTEGRATION ALONG WITH QUANTITATIVE PROCEDURES, FOR EXAMPLE, STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), HAS EMERGED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LITERATURE REVIEW IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN CONNECTED SO FAR IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES CONCERNING THE ASSESSMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY. THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY WAS RESTRICTED TO ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM 1960 TO 2022. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY USING A BROAD SET OF KEYWORDS, ENCOMPASSING BOTH LIFE CYCLE METHODS, INCLUDING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL LIFE CYCLE COSTING AND EMERGY ACCOUNTING, AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS, SUCH AS MATHEMATICAL METHODS, ECONOMIC METHODS AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING METHODS. A TOTAL OF 144 ARTICLES ADDRESSING THE COMBINED USE OF LIFE CYCLE METHODS AND QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE EVALUATION OF SUSTAINABILITY WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW. THE GREATER PART OF THESE STUDIES RELIED ON THE COMBINED USE OF LCA WITH MATHEMATICAL MODELS, STATISTICAL METHODS AND AI METHODS. AS A RESULT, THE STUDIES PROVEN THAT THE JOINT APPLICATION OF SUCH METHODS CAN IMPROVE CONSISTENCY OF SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT AND ENHANCE CSR. ADDITIONALLY, MANY ARTICLES SUGGESTED NOVEL APPROACHES, INCLUDING A COMBINED USE OF LCA AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING AS WELL AS SIMULATION METHODS. THE COMBINED USE OF LIFE CYCLE METHODS ALONGSIDE QUANTITATIVE METHODS OFFERS PROMISE IN ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT BY OFFERING MORE PRECISE AND CONSISTENT OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY EVALUATE THE HYPOTHESES, ACCURACY OF DATA, AND UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH METHOD WITHIN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS FOR COMBINING THESE METHODOLOGIES AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SUITABLE PROCEDURES FOR THEIR INTEGRATION WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES CONCERNING SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","PARTHENOPE UNIVERSITY NAPLES; UNIVERSITY OF BERGAMO",NA,"ROBERTO.CERCHIONE@UNIPARTHENOPE.IT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1002/csr.3010","L0B2C","1535-3966","OCT 2024",NA,NA,"OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING FACILITATED BY UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI NAPOLI PARTHENOPE, AS PART OF THE WILEY - CRUI-CARE AGREEMENT.",NA,"1535-3958","CORP.

DUE TO A LACK OF CONSENSUS ON THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES IN BUILDING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), THE CARBON ESTIMATION RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE CURRENT METHODS ARE OFTEN DISPUTABLE. IN THIS REGARD, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING BUILDING EMBODIED CARBON BASED ON DIGITAL TWIN TECHNOLOGY AND LCA. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS ADVANTAGEOUS OVER OTHERS BY PROVIDING (1) A CRADLE-TO-CRADLE LCA AND (2) AN AUTOMATED DATA COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LCA AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) DATABASES. BECAUSE DATA FOR THE PROCESSES IN THE LIFE CYCLE ARE COLLECTED VIA DIGITAL TWIN TECHNOLOGY IN A STANDARD AND CONSISTENT WAY, THE OBTAINED RESULTS WILL BE CONSIDERED CREDIBLE. SO FAR, A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW, WHICH CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS. IN THE FIRST PART, FORMULAS FOR LCA ARE GIVEN.

THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT IN THE CASE STUDY, FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS IN DIFFERENT SHARED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PATHS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE, WITH WALL U-VALUE, WINDOWS U-VALUE, AND WALL DENSITY IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING BUILDING PERFORMANCE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY. THE ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL ACHIEVES HIGH FIDELITY IN PREDICTING LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS (LCCE), LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC), AND INDOOR DISCOMFORT HOURS (IDH) THROUGH INPUT FEATURE SCREENING AND HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION. COMPARING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, TWO-ARCHIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRAINED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION (C-TAEA) DEMONSTRATES BETTER CONVERGENCE DEGREE AND OPTIMIZATION EFFECT. AMONG THE TESTED MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION MAKING METHODS, THE VIKOR METHOD SELECTS THE BEST BUILDING RESILIENT DESIGN SCHEME FROM THE PARETO DATA SET, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING LCCE, LCC, AND IDH, AND LEADING TO AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE. APPLYING THIS FRAMEWORK, THE FINALIZED SCHEME FOR AN OFFICE BUILDING IN COLD REGION OPTIMIZES 44.0\% OF LCCE, 8.2\% OF LCC, AND 4.3\% OF IDH. THIS FRAMEWORK DEVELOPS A NEW APPROACH TO IMPROVE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY AND SUPPORTS INFORMED DECISION-MAKING FOR RESILIENT BUILDING DESIGN. TO PROMOTE CARBON NEUTRALITY IN CONSTRUCTION, IT IS URGED THAT FUTURE STUDIES INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY, SUCH AS OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR, INTO THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG; HARVARD UNIVERSITY; GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY; FUZHOU UNIVERSITY","113761","ZOU.YUKAI@OUTLOOK.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113761","AR5J6","1872-6178","NOV 2023",NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [52308016]; GUANGDONG BASIC AND APPLIED BASIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION [2023A1515011364]; STATE KEY LABO-RATORY OF SUBTROPICAL BUILDING SCIENCE [2022ZB06]; SCI-ENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY","<B>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</B> THIS RESEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (GRANT NO. 52308016) , GUANGDONG BASIC AND APPLIED BASIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION (GRANT NO. 2023A1515011364) , STATE KEY LABO-RATORY OF SUBTROPICAL BUILDING SCIENCE (GRANT NO. 2022ZB06) , AND SCI-ENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF GUANGZHOU UNIVERSITY (GRANT NO.

AFTER THE FEATURE ELIMINATION, THE ENSEMBLE LEARNING MODEL (ELM) WAS TRAINED TO OBTAIN A HIGH-PRECISION MODEL FOR PREDICTING LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS (LCCE), LIFE CYCLE COSTS (LCC), AND INDOOR DISCOMFORT HOURS (IDH). THEN, THE OPTIMAL OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM WAS SELECTED AMONG THREE DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS. FINALLY, THE BEST BUILDING SCHEME WAS CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE NEWLY PROPOSED SOLUTION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ELM COULD ACHIEVE HIGH PREDICTION EFFICIENCY BY COMBINING INPUT FEATURE EVALUATION AND SCREENING, MULTI-SAMPLING METHODS, AND HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION. THE R2 VALUE OF ELM CAN REACH 0.980, WHILE THE TWO-ARCHIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRAINED MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMI-ZATION (C-TAEA) WAS THE OPTIMAL OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. THE BEST EQUILIBRIUM SOLUTION PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION RANGES OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES AND MAXIMIZED THE OPTIMIZATION VALUE. FINALLY, THE BEST EQUILIBRIUM SCHEME REDUCED THE LCCE BY 34.7\%, THE LCC BY 13.9\%, AND THE IDH BY 26.6\%. THEREFORE, THIS STRATEGY CAN EFFICIENTLY OPTIMIZE BUILDING OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCE A MORE BALANCED AND OPTIMAL BUILDING SCHEME, THUS MAKING IT WIDELY APPLICABLE IN BUILDING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY; FUZHOU UNIVERSITY","125373","TSAYYS@MAIL.NCKU.EDU.TW",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.energy.2022.125373","4Y0EC","1873-6785","SEP 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0360-5442","ENERGY","ENERGY","ENGLISH","JAN 1",NA,"65",NA,NA,"TSAY, YAW-SHYAN/0000-0001-6935-784X CHEN, RUIJUN/0000-0002-1271-4751",NA,NA,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THERMODYNAMICS; ENERGY \& FUELS","TSAY, YAW-SHYAN/M-5980-2017 ",NA,31,"A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY FOR BUILDING CARBON EMISSION FROM THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE","ARTICLE","WOS000861206700002","15","122","262","THERMODYNAMICS; ENERGY \& FUELS","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"CHEN RUIJUN;TSAY YAW-SHYAN;ZHANG TING","TSAY, YS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV, DEPT ARCHITECTURE, TAINAN, TAIWAN","ISI","ENERGY","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV;FUZHOU UNIV","NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV",NA,"CHEN R, 2023, ENERGY","CHEN R, 2023, ENERGY",NA

FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS, HOWEVER, THE OVERHEAD ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SENSOR PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY ASSURANCE AND SENSOR DATA ANALYSIS CREATES A BARRIER THAT DIMINISHES THE BENEFIT OF SUCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

PREVIOUS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE USE PHASE OF A BUILDING IS DOMINANT IN MOST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES. DUE TO THE LONG LIFE SPAN OF BUILDINGS AND POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN USAGE PATTERNS OVER TIME, A SHIFT TOWARD DLCA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. WE DEFINE DLCA AS AN APPROACH TO LCA WHICH EXPLICITLY INCORPORATES DYNAMIC PROCESS MODELING IN THE CONTEXT OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS. A SIMPLIFIED MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS USED TO INCORPORATE DYNAMIC INFORMATION FROM THE CASE STUDY BUILDING, TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT SOURCES OF LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATA AND TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS, WHERE AVAILABLE. THE DLCA MODEL WAS EVALUATED FOR THE HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF AN EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING, WITH ADDITIONAL SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT FOR SENSITIVITY AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF FUTURE IMPACTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT OVERALL LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS VARIED GREATLY IN SOME CATEGORIES WHEN COMPARED TO STATIC LCA RESULTS, GENERATED FROM THE TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE OF EITHER THE BUILDING'S INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OR ITS RECENT RENOVATION. FROM THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION PERSPECTIVE, IMPACTS IN CATEGORIES RELATED TO CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS WERE REDUCED BY MORE THAN 50 \% WHEN COMPARED TO A STATIC LCA, EVEN THOUGH NONRENEWABLE ENERGY USE INCREASED BY 15 \%. POLLUTION CONTROLS WERE A MAJOR REASON FOR THESE REDUCTIONS. IN THE FUTURE SCENARIO ANALYSIS, THE BASELINE DLCA SCENARIO SHOWED A DECREASE IN ALL IMPACT CATEGORIES COMPARED WITH THE STATIC LCA. THE OUTER BOUNDS OF THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS VARIED FROM SLIGHTLY HIGHER TO STRONGLY LOWER THAN THE STATIC RESULTS, INDICATING THE GENERAL ROBUSTNESS OF THE DECLINE ACROSS THE SCENARIOS. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE USE OF DYNAMIC MODELING IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO INCREASE THE RELEVANCE OF RESULTS. IN SOME CASES, DECISION MAKING RELATED TO BUILDING DESIGN AND OPERATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY CONSIDERING THE INTERACTION OF TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE STEPS OF THE LCA. THE DLCA RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN SOME CASES, CHANGES DURING A BUILDING'S LIFETIME CAN INFLUENCE THE LCA RESULTS TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN THE MATERIAL AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. ADAPTING LCA TO A MORE DYNAMIC APPROACH MAY INCREASE THE USEFULNESS OF THE METHOD IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY; ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH",NA,"MBILEC@PITT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-012-0528-2","089HC","1614-7502",NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER EFRI-SEED GRANT [1038139]; MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; EPA STAR GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP [FP917321]; DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING; EMERGING FRONTIERS \& MULTIDISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES [1038139] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; EPA [673112, FP917321] FUNDING SOURCE: FEDERAL REPORTER","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER EFRI-SEED GRANT \#1038139 AND THE MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AND BY EPA STAR GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP FP917321.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

HOWEVER, INCREASING WOOD MATERIALS USE IN THE BUILT MARKET CAN HAVE UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL SUPPLY CHAINS. CONSEQUENTIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (CLCA) ALLOWS THE ASSESSMENT OF CHANGES IN MATERIAL SUPPLY CHAIN. TO QUANTIFY AND LINK THOSE CONSEQUENCES, THE AFFECTED PHYSICAL FLOWS NEED TO BE ESTIMATED. MATERIAL FLOW ANALYSIS (MFA) CAN BRING TO CLCA MODELLING MORE REPRESENTATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION THAN THE COMMONLY USED HYPOTHESIS IN CONSEQUENTIAL MODELLING. INDEED, MFA CONSIDERS PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS (TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCES AND MATERIAL AVAILABILITY), IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNT FOR MASS BALANCE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW SUCH CONSISTENCY IS ADDED TO CLCA THROUGH AN MFA OF WOOD PRODUCTS IN NON-RESIDENTIAL (NR) BUILDINGS IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA). WOOD FLOWS ARE TRACKED TO IDENTIFY THEIR END-USE MARKETS AND TRENDS IN CONSUMPTION. TO OVERCOME THE LACK OF DATA AND BRING INSIGHTS ON THE SECTOR'S DYNAMICS, SUCH AS STOCK VARIATIONS AND POTENTIAL DISCARDED FLOWS THAT SUPPLY RECYCLING MARKETS, RESIDENCE TIME MODEL AND ALSO EXTRAPOLATION AND CORRELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC PARAMETERS ARE USED. RESULTS SHOW HOW FLOWS CAN INCREASE IN THE MARKET BEFORE REACHING THEIR PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS, SUCH AS THE AVAILABLE WOOD STOCK IN THE FOREST. THESE INSIGHTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE DATA COLLECTION FOR CLCA. IN CONCLUSION, THE MFA BRINGS SUPPORT TO CLCA BY PROPOSING A FRAMEWORK TO MODEL CHANGES IN THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET.","DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF SHERBROOKE; LAVAL UNIVERSITY","012056","CORDIER@USHERBROOKE.CA",NA,"SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT D-A-CH CONFERENCE 2019 (SBE19 GRAZ)","2024-12-23","10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012056","BP7IP",NA,NA,"PASSER, A AND LUTZKENDORF, T AND HABERT, G AND KROMPKOLB, H AND MONSBERGER, M","NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA THROUGH ITS IRC PROGRAM [IRCPJ 461745-18, RDCPJ 524504-18]; NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA THROUGH ITS CRD PROGRAM [IRCPJ 461745-18, RDCPJ 524504-18]; NSERC INDUSTRIAL CHAIR ON ECO-RESPONSIBLE WOOD CONSTRUCTION (CIRCERB)","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH ITS IRC AND CRD PROGRAMS (IRCPJ 461745-18 AND RDCPJ 524504-18) AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS OF THE NSERC INDUSTRIAL CHAIR ON ECO-RESPONSIBLE WOOD CONSTRUCTION (CIRCERB).",NA,"1755-1307","IOP CONF.

OFTEN THE IMPACTS OCCURING ACROSS THE OTHER STAGES OF A BUILDING'S LIFE ARE NOT CONSIDERED OR ARE SEEN AS INSIGNIFICANT IN COMPARISON. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EMBODIED IMPACTS CAN BE JUST AS IMPORTANT. THERE IS LIMITED CONSISTENT AND COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR BUILDING DESIGNERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN THIS AREA. OFTEN THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE IS FROM DISPARATE SOURCES, WHICH MAKES COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS UNRELIABLE.

OLEFINS ARE IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK CHEMICALS WITH SEVERAL APPLICATIONS AND CARBON CAPTURE AND UTILISATION (CCU) CAN PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION ROUTE. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM INVOLVES DIRECT AIR CAPTURE (DAC) OF CO2; PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE (PEM) WATER ELECTROLYSIS FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION, METHANOL SYNTHESIS, METHANOL TO OLEFINS (MTO) UPGRADE, AND POWER GENERATION FROM OFF-SHORE WIND TURBINES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NEW INTEGRATED PROCESS AS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO HOLISTICALLY ASSESS A WHOLE CCU ASSEMBLY AIMING AT OLEFINS PRODUCTION. PROCESSING MODELLING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED USING THE ASPEN PLUS V12.1 AND MATLAB R2022A SOFTWARE TO SOLVE THE MASS AND ENERGY BALANCES OF EACH UNIT OPERATION. THE MODELLING RESULTS SHOWED A CARBON EFFICIENCY OF 72.3\% TO ETHYLENE AND PROPYLENE. IN ADDITION, THE PROCESS IS DESIGNED AND INTEGRATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO EXTERNAL HEAT SUPPLY IS REQUIRED. A SPECIFIC ENERGY CONSUMPTION (SEC) OF 150 MJ/KG OLEFINS (41 KWH/KG) HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. A MINIMUM SELLING PRICE OF 3.67 POUND PER KG OF OLEFINS IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROPOSED PROCESS TO BREAK-EVEN. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS HAS REVEALED THAT THE MAJOR COST DRIVER IS THE COST OF ELECTRICITY. IN ADDITION, THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS EXPOSED THAT THE PROPOSED SYNTHESIS ROUTE OF OLEFINS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) BY 47\% COMPARED TO FOSSIL- BASED PRODUCTION. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS STUDY CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO ENGINEERING CONCEPTUAL STUDIES, POLICY MAKERS AND CONTRIBUTE NEW INFORMATION TO THE CCU ACADEMIC COMMUNITY.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD; UNIVERSITY OF HULL","143143","GACUEVASCASTILLO1@SHEFFIELD.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143143","ZD1O4","1879-1786","JUL 2024",NA,"MEXICAN COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CONACYT) [CVU 703759]; UNIVERSITY OF HULL","THE FIRST AUTHOR IS GRATEFUL TO THE MEXICAN COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CONACYT) FOR THE PHD SCHOLARSHIP (CVU 703759) .

THIS STUDY ANALYZED SIX LIFE-CYCLE STAGES AND CALCULATED THE LIFE-CYCLE CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN 30 CHINESE PROVINCIAL JURISDICTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE DISPARITY AMONG THEM. RESULTS SHOW THAT BUILDING MATERIALS PRODUCTION WAS THE KEY STAGE FOR CARBON REDUCTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR, FOLLOWED BY THE BUILDING OPERATION STAGE. EXTERNAL VARIABLES, E.G., ECONOMIC GROWTH, INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE, URBANIZATION, PRICE FLUCTUATION, AND MARKETIZATION, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE EMISSION INTENSITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY, ECONOMIC GROWTH EXHIBITED AN INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATION WITH CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA AND PER AREA DURING THE PERIOD EXAMINED. SECONDARY INDUSTRY AND LAND URBANIZATION WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH CO2 EMISSION INTENSITY INDICATORS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR, WHEREAS TERTIARY INDUSTRY AND URBANIZATION WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED. PRICE INDICES AND MARKETIZATION HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON CO2 EMISSION INTENSITY. THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS ARE THAT CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR CEMENT PROVIDERS, AND GREEN PURCHASING RULES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR SHOULD ALSO BE ESTABLISHED.

LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ANALYSIS IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DESIGNED ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ASCERTAIN THE STATE OF RESEARCH ON THE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ANALYSIS OF BUILDINGS TO FORMULATE A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR REDUCING THE ENERGY FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING SECTOR. THE STUDY IS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE EXPLORATIVE METHOD OF RESEARCH USING A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW APPROACH. THE MATERIAL FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS SELECTED FROM FIVE SCIENTIFIC DATABASES THROUGH A RIGOROUS AND STRUCTURED PROCESS. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT METHODS OF LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ESTIMATION ARE TEDIOUS AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE, REQUIRING NUMEROUS, INCOMPLETE INVENTORY DATABASES AND ENERGY SIMULATION TOOLS THAT REQUIRE A USER INTERFACE. MOREOVER, THE LACK OF EXPLICIT GUIDELINES OR STANDARDS FOR LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ESTIMATION CAUSES LARGE VARIATIONS IN THE RESULTS, THUS MAKING THE COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT STUDIES UNREALISTIC. FURTHER, RECENT TRENDS REVEAL THE USE OF METHODS SUCH AS THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT METHOD, MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMISATION, MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING, DATA ANALYTICS, AND THE INCREASING RELEVANCE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) FOR ENERGY CALCULATIONS AND EVALUATION OF DESIGN ALTERNATIVES.

THE DEMAND FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY AND CREDIBILITY OF LCA RESULTS HAS INCREASED THE NEED FOR LCI CONTAINING HIGHER DATA GRANULARITY AND QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS STUDY, A NOVEL DATA PROCESSING METHOD IS PROPOSED TO FACILITATE REGIONALIZED LCI DATABASE COMPILATION AND UNCERTAINTY CHARACTERIZATION. THE KEY STEP IN THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TO RETAIN VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS BY BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND TEMPORAL QUANTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS AND MATERIAL/ENERGY INPUT AMOUNTS USING MULTILEVEL MODELING (MLM) RATHER THAN LOSING THE VARIATIONS VIA A TRADITIONAL AGGREGATION METHOD. THE UNCERTAINTY IS OBJECTIVELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE MODEL PREDICTION INTERVAL. AN EXAMPLE CASE STUDY IS CONDUCTED ON NITROGEN FERTILIZER APPLICATION FOR CORN PRODUCTION WITH DATA COLLECTED IN 19 U.S. STATES FROM 1990 TO 2016. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ESTIMATES BY THE PROPOSED APPROACH ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN THOSE BY CURRENT AGGREGATION METHODS. FOR THE UNIT-YIELD-BASED INPUT AND UNIT-AREA-BASED INPUT, RESPECTIVELY, AROUND 60\% AND 80\% OF VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS ARE EXPLAINED BY MLM, AND 86.1\% AND 96.8\% OF THE UNREPRESENTATIVENESS FACTORS FOR THE MLM ESTIMATES ARE LESS THAN 0.2, COMPARED TO 62.3\% AND 70.5\% WHEN TRADITIONAL THREE-YEAR AGGREGATION IS USED. THE 95\% PREDICTION INTERVALS COVER MORE THAN 95\% OF MEASUREMENT DATA IN BOTH INPUT CASES. IT IS SUGGESTED TO APPLY AN MLM-BASED DATA PROCESSING FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE DATABASE COMPILATION OR FOR REINFORCING A GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) BASED REGIONALIZED LCI DATABASE.

THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL QUANTIFICATION OF THE IMPACT OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS GENERATED BY A MONOFUNCTIONAL BIM TO PLAN ROAD MAINTENANCE - A PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PMS) -ARE EVALUATED USING FIELD DATA FROM FRANCE. THE RELATED CARBON FOOTPRINTS ARE CALCULATED FOLLOWING A LIFE CYCLE APPROACH, USING DIFFERENT SOURCES OF DATA - INCLUDING ECOINVENT V3.6 - AND THE IPCC 2013 GWP 100A CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS. THREE DESIGN-BUILD-MAINTAIN PAVEMENT ALTERNATIVES ARE COMPARED: SCENARIO 1 RELATES TO A MASSIVE DESIGN AND SURFACE MAINTENANCE, SCENARIO 2 TO A PROGRESSIVE DESIGN AND PRE-PLANNED STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE, AND SCENARIO 3 TO A PROGRESSIVE DESIGN AND TAILORED STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE SUPPORTED BY THE PMS. FIRST, RESULTS SHOW THE NEGLIGIBLE DIRECT EMISSIONS DUE TO THE PMS EXISTENCE - 0.02\% OF THE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS OF SCENARIO 3'S PAVEMENT, E.G. 0.52 T CO2EQ FOR 10 KM AND 30 YEARS. SECOND, THE BASE CASE AND TWO COMPLEMENTARY SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE USE OF A PMS IS CLIMATE-POSITIVE OVER THE LIFE CYCLE WHEN PAVEMENT SUBGRADE BEARING CAPACITY IMPROVES OVER TIME, NEUTRAL FOR THE CLIMATE OTHERWISE. THE GHG EMISSIONS SAVINGS USING BIM CAN REACH UP TO 14 AND 30\% OF THE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO SCENARIO 2 AND 1, AND RESP. 47 AND 65\% WHEN RESTRAINING THE SCOPE TO MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION AND EXCLUDING ORIGINAL PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION. THIRD, THE NEUTRAL EFFECT OF BIM IN CASE OF A DETE-RIORATION OF THE BEARING CAPACITY OF THE SUBGRADE MAY BE EXPLAINED BY DESIGN PRACTICES AND SAFETY MARGINS, THAT COULD IN FACT BE ENHANCED USING BIM.

THIS FRAMEWORK IS NOW A KEY ELEMENT OF EUROPEAN INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP A CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND AIMS TO ADDRESS WHOLE LIFE CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND TO DRIVE A RENOVATION WAVE FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS. ANALYSIS OF THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON GHG EMISSIONS, IS ALSO THE FOCUS OF INITIATIVES IN SEVERAL EU MEMBER STATES. TO SUPPORT USERS, LEVEL(S) WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A LIST OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) SOFTWARE TOOLS AND DATABASES FOR CALCULATING SUCH INDICATORS. A NEED WAS IDENTIFIED FOR PRAC-TICAL, USER-ORIENTATED INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCOPE, CONSISTENCY, COST, AND ACCESSIBILITY OF LCA SOFTWARE TOOLS AND DATABASES. THEREFORE, A LIST OF LCA TOOLS AND DATABASES USED IN EUROPE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDINGS WAS COMPILED IN 2017-2020 AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSED BASED ON A SET OF CRITERIA. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE POLICY CONTEXT OF LEVEL(S) AND DISCUSSES CRITERIA THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE CHARACTERISATION OF LCA SOFTWARE TOOLS AND DATABASES FROM THE LIST COMPILED FOR LEVEL(S). THE METHODS INCLUDED A LITERATURE REVIEW, SURVEYS/INTERVIEWS, AND THE CO-CREATION OF CRITERIA FOR THE CATEGORIZATION OF TOOLS AND DATABASES. THE RESULTS ARE CRITERIA INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION-SPECIFICITY, SYSTEM BOUNDARIES \& SCOPE, INDICATORS, MODELLING GRANULARITY, METHODOLOGICAL ADHERENCE TO LEVEL(S) AND EN STANDARDS, DATA QUALITY, TRANSPARENCY AND VERIFICATION, ACCESSIBILITY, DATA EXCHANGE AND INTEROPERABILITY, COST, TRAINING AND SUPPORT, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. BY PROVIDING GREATER VISIBILITY REGARDING THE FEATURES OF TOOLS AND DATABASES, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE MAIN-STREAM USE OF LEVEL(S) AND ALSO TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY EU POLICY INITIATIVES AIMED AT ENHANCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE EU RENOVATION WAVE, THE NEW EUROPEAN BAUHAUS, AND THE EU TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN; ETH ZURICH","106642","CDEWOLF@ETHZ.CH",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106642","5T1BR","1879-0658","OCT 2022",NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE SEVILLA; ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE (EPFL) [ARES(2019)4061069-26/06/2019]; DG ENV [JRC 35025-2018/DG ENV 07020/2018/777131/AA/ENV.B.1]; DG JRC [JRC 35025-2018/DG ENV 07020/2018/777131/AA/ENV.B.1]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY A EUROPEAN COMMISSION JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE SEVILLA CONTRACT WITH ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE (EPFL) ON ``SUPPORT IN THE VERIFICATION OF LEVEL(S) TEST PROJECTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LCA GUIDANCE JRC REF: ARES(2019)4061069-26/06/2019)''.

THE PRESENT WORK AIMS AT EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, AND THEREFORE THE ACTUAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, EXAMINING A GROUND-MOUNTED 1778.48 KW(P) PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANT, REALIZED BY TERNIENERGIA S.P.A. AND LOCATED IN MARSCIANO (PERUGIA, ITALY). THE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED USING THE METHODOLOGY OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH ALLOWS TO CONSIDER ALL STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE, FROM THE EXTRACTION OF RAW MATERIALS TO THE PLANT'S DISPOSAL (''FROM A CRADLE TO GRAVE PERSPECTIVE''). IN PARTICULAR, THE STUDY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SOIL PREPARATION, THE INSTALLATION OF FENCE AND ELECTRICAL SUBSTATIONS OF LOW AND MEDIUM VOLTAGE, THE MOUNTING OF SUPPORT STRUCTURES, ALSO WITH REFERENCE TO HOT DIP GALVANIZING PROCESS, THE PRODUCTION OF MODULES, THEIR INSTALLATION, THE WIRING APPARATUS AND THE NETWORK CONNECTION. THE TRANSPORT OF ALL COMPONENTS TO THE INSTALLATION SITE IS CONSIDERED FOR EACH STAGE THAT IS EXAMINED. THE END OF LIFE SCENARIO OF THE PLANT IS ALSO EVALUATED. THE POSSIBILITY TO COLLECT MANY DETAILED INFORMATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION SITE, DURING THE BUILDING PHASE, ADDS VALUE TO THE STUDY. THE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO UNI EN ISO 14040 AND UNI EN ISO 14044, WHICH REGULATE THE LCA PROCEDURE. THE LCA MODELLING WAS PERFORMED USING SIMAPRO SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND USING ECO INDICATOR 99 METHODOLOGY. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ALLOWS TO CALCULATE SOME IMPORTANT PARAMETERS LIKE EPBT (ENERGY PAY-BACK TIME), EROEI (ENERGY RETURN ON ENERGY INVESTED), CO2 EMISSIONS AND GWP100 (GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL). FINALLY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANT IS COMPARED TO THAT OF SOME TRADITIONAL ENERGY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER LTD.

WHILE RAINWATER HARVESTING IS PERCEIVED AS A SUSTAINABLE DESIGN APPROACH, THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. TO ADDRESS THIS LITERATURE GAP, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING TOOLS WERE APPLIED FOR A DORMITORY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY USE HARVESTED RAINWATER TO FLUSH TOILETS OR TO IRRIGATE THE LAWN. FIVE SCENARIOS WERE MODELED INCLUDING A NEW VERSUS RENOVATED BUILDING AND IRRIGATION VERSUS TOILET FLUSHING WATER END USE. THE RAINWATER CISTERNS FOR ALL THE SCENARIOS WERE SIZED USING THE YIELD AFTER SPILLAGE APPROACH AND LONG TERM DAILY PRECIPITATION OF TOLEDO. ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE CALCULATED USING ECONOMIC INPUT OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (FOR CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND ENERGY USE BY PUMP) AND GABI (FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT) DATABASES. THE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS WERE ESTIMATED AND COMPARED TO THE BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO, WHERE THE WATER SUPPLY DEMANDS ARE MET BY MUNICIPALLY SUPPLIED POTABLE WATER IN A COMBINED OR SEPARATE SANITARY SEWER NETWORK. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION PAYBACK PERIODS CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR ALMOST EVERY SCENARIO. YET COST PAYBACK PERIODS OF IMPLEMENTING HARVESTED RAINWATER WERE FOUND TO BE LONGER THAN THE LIFE TIME OF THE BUILDING EXCEPT FOR TWO SCENARIOS: USING RAINWATER FOR IRRIGATION IN A RENOVATION PROJECT AND USING RAINWATER FOR TOILET FLUSHING IN A NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THESE TWO SCENARIOS HAD THE LOWEST COST, ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION IMPACTS AMONG ALL SCENARIOS MODELED. REDUCING OCCUPANCY TO MATCH TOILET FLUSHING DEMAND INCREASED THE PER PERSON IMPACT. HOWEVER, IN GENERAL, THE PER PERSON IMPACTS WERE MUCH LOWER THAN A PERSON'S IMPACT FROM DRIVING OR ELECTRICITY USE. WHILE SEPARATE SEWERS DIVERT THE STORMWATER RUNOFF TO THE WATER BODIES AND THEREBY PREVENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS, A RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM CONNECTED TO SEPARATE SEWERS WAS FOUND TO REDUCE THE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LESS THAN SO IF THE RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM WERE CONNECTED TO COMBINED SEWERS.

THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY SECTOR TO INTERVENE IN, BUT MITIGATION STRATEGIES MUST FOCUS ON MORE THAN JUST OPERATIONAL ENERGY. AS CURRENT CLIMATE POLICIES RECOMMEND, DESIGNERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CHARACTERIZING THE ENTIRE BUILDING LIFECYCLE. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CONSIDERS THE MENTIONED ASPECTS. NEVERTHELESS, THE COMPLEXITY OF LCA AND THE CRITICALITIES OF RELATED TOOLS PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROACH DURING DECISIVE EARLY STAGES. ADDITIONALLY, LCA ALLOWS THE ESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, BUT FAILS TO DESCRIBE OTHER DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY. THE ARTICLE PROPOSES AN EVALUATION METHOD TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING DURING THE DESIGN OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS. THE METHOD EXPLOITS THE LCA TOOL AND THE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY A GREEN SUSTAINABLE BUILDING CERTIFICATION (ACTIVE HOUSE) INTEGRATED WITH BIM. THE APPROACH WAS APPLIED AND PROVEN THROUGH A CASE STUDY: A RESIDENTIAL SINGLE-FAMILY BUILDING IN NORTHERN ITALY, COMPARING TWO TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIONS. THE STUDY CONFIRMED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MULTICRITERIA EVALUATION FRAMEWORK THAT, FROM THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE, CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS ALONGSIDE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FINAL USERS' COMFORT.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF MILAN; POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF MILAN","1315","NICOLE.DISANTO@POLIMI.IT LEIDY.GUANTE@POLIMI.IT GIOVANNI.DOTELLI@POLIMI.IT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings13051315","H7RV3","2075-5309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","MAY 18",NA,"41","5","GREEN PUBLISHED, GOLD","GUANTE HENRIQUEZ, LEIDY/0000-0001-8535-3021 IMPERADORI, MARCO/0000-0002-7590-1335 /0000-0003-1876-9881 DI SANTO, NICOLE/0000-0001-8587-2526",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","GUANTE HENRIQUEZ, LEIDY/IQT-7691-2023 /F-9329-2013 ",NA,8,"HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR ASSESSING BUILDINGS' ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND USER COMFORT FROM EARLY DESIGN: A METHOD COMBINING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT, BIM, AND ACTIVE HOUSE PROTOCOL","ARTICLE","WOS000997899500001","2","17","13","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"DI SANTO NICOLE;HENRIQUEZ LEIDY GUANTE;DOTELLI GIOVANNI; IMPERADORI MARCO","HENRIQUEZ, LG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), POLITECN MILAN, DEPT ARCHITECTURE BUILT ENVIRONM \& CONSTRUCT ENGN, I-20133 MILAN, ITALY","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","LG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);SCUOLA UNIV PROFESS SVIZZERA ITALIANA SUPSI;G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);DEPT ARCHITECTURE BUILT ENVIRONM AND CONSTRUCT ENGN;SCUOLA UNIV PROFESS SVIZZERA ITALIANA SUPSI;POLITECN MILAN","LG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR)",NA,"DI SANTO N, 2023, BUILDINGS-BASEL","DI SANTO N, 2023, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

IN EVALUATING HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL USE, MOST GREEN CHEMISTRY METRICS ONLY CONSIDER THOSE CHEMICALS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNTHESIS AND MISS UPSTREAM HAZARDS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OR EVEN DOMINATE OVERALL IMPACTS WHEN EVALUATED USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). CONVERSELY, LCA METRICS ARE WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON EMISSIONS AND DO NOT CAPTURE POTENTIAL RISKS POSED BY INHERENTLY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. LIFE CYCLE INHERENT TOXICITY I* IS A PROPOSED NOVEL METRIC THAT ADAPTS THE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF LCA BY ATTACHING MEASURES OF INHERENT HAZARD TO THE INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL FLOWS, RATHER THAN CONSIDERING ONLY EMISSIONS. THUS, IT CAPTURES TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTIRE CRADLE-TO-GATE OF A CHEMICAL, RATHER THAN JUST DIRECT CHEMICAL INPUTS INTO A SYNTHESIS, AND IS A FUNCTION OF UPSTREAM USE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, RATHER THAN ONLY EMISSIONS. VALUES OF I* ARE CALCULATED FOR 181 ORGANIC CHEMICALS FROM THE ECOINVENT LCI DATABASE. STATISTICAL TESTING REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN LIFE CYCLE INHERENT TOXICITY AND CONVENTIONAL TOXICITY, SUGGESTING THAT THE PROPOSED METRIC PROVIDES NOVEL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURRENT GREEN CHEMISTRY METRICS. OUTLIERS ARE INVESTIGATED WHERE THE TARGET CHEMICAL IS MUCH MORE TOXIC THAN ITS UPSTREAM BUILDING BLOCKS (E.G., PHOSGENE) AND, CONVERSELY, WHERE UPSTREAM CHEMICAL TOXICITY DOMINATES (E.G., ANILINE). VALUES OF I* ARE WEAKLY CORRELATED WITH VALUES OF CONVENTIONAL LIFE CYCLE TOXICITY FROM THE USETOX LCIA MODEL, AGAIN SUGGESTING THAT THE NEW METRIC PROVIDES ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO (1) DEVELOP A BIM MATURITY MODEL THAT ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS BY (2) USING AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF AN EARLY ADOPTER CASE STUDY, THUS ADDRESSING THE LACK OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN BIM ADOPTION EXPERIENCES. A SINGLE INTERPRETIVE RESEARCH STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYSE A US-BASED UNIVERSITY. THE DATA WERE GATHERED THROUGH INTERVIEWS, FIELD VISITS AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS. ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY (ANT) CONCEPTS SCAFFOLDED THE ANALYTICAL APPROACH. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT A COMPLEX BIM SOCIO-TECHNICAL NETWORK EMERGED, DEVELOPED AND CONVERGED DURING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT STAGE BUT STRUGGLED TO ACHIEVE DURABILITY AS AN ONGOING SOLUTION TO FACILITIES MANAGEMENT.

IT IS SHOWN THAT CURRENT INVENTORY DATA AND MODELS ARE INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE UPTAKE AND EMISSION OF CHEMICALS DURING USE, THE MIGRATION OF CHEMICALS WITHIN THE VALUE CHAIN ACROSS THE MULTIPLE PHASES IN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY, AND BECAUSE CURRENT CHARACTERIZATION MODELS LACK A LARGE FRACTION OF THE POTENTIALLY EMITTED CHEMICALS FROM SAID UPTAKE AND EMISSION IDENTIFIED IN THE TESTED BUILDING MATERIAL SAMPLES.

THE PAPER ADDRESSES THIS COMMON LIMITATION OFFERING AN INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AT BUILDING LEVEL. TO ACHIEVE THIS, A BIM-EMBEDDED APPROACH WAS ESTABLISHED UTILISING EMBODIED CARBON METRICS AND RESULTS FROM HEURISTIC STRUCTURAL OPTIMISATION. A REAL BUILDING SCENARIO WAS USED TO TEST THE PROPOSED APPROACH IN THE CONTEXT OF MULTI-STOREY REINFORCED CONCRETE (RC) BUILDINGS. RESULTS SHOW HOW THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE USE OF STRUCTURALLY OPTIMISED DESIGNS. THE STRUCTURAL FLOORS IN PARTICULAR, NOT ONLY COVER THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF THE EMBODIED CARBON IN THE STRUCTURE BUT THEY ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE TESTED BUILDING ELEMENTS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS PAPER JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS IN THE DESIGN OPTIMISATION OF RC FLOORS. OVERALL, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE UNCLEAR INTERPRETATION OF THE OPTIMISATION OUTPUTS WOULD RESULT IN THE SELECTION OF STRUCTURAL DESIGNS THAT COULD COMPROMISE THE BUILDINGS CARBON PERFORMANCE.

THE STUDY'S FOCUS IS TO DETERMINE SUITABLE SIZES FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS, WIND TURBINES, AND BATTERY ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS BY EVALUATING ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE DEVELOP A DATA-DRIVEN MODEL THAT INCORPORATES HOMER PRO AND AN IN-HOUSE TOOL DEVELOPED IN PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT INTEGRATES A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM, LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC), LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CALCULATIONS OF THE REC MODEL. FURTHERMORE, A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION MODEL IS ESTABLISHED TO MINIMIZE THE LCC AND LCA PARAMETERS WHILE MAXIMIZING GREEN ENERGY USE. MOREOVER, A MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING APPROACH BASED ON WEIGHTED SUM MODEL (WSM) IS PROPOSED TO HELP THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE BEYOND THE SELECTION CRITERIA BASED ON LCC AND LCA TO CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE SCENARIO OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR THE DESIRED ENERGY COMMUNITY AND INTERPRET THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC PARAMETERS ON THE SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE OF REC. THE FRAMEWORK APPLICATION IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH A CASE STUDY FOR THE OPTIMAL DESIGN OF REC FOR A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY IN TARRAGONA, SPAIN, CONSISTING OF 100 BUILDINGS.

METHODS THIS METHODOLOGY WAS BASED ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DATA AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS), WHICH HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE DATA WERE CHARACTERIZED AT THREE LEVELS: GLOBAL, REPRESENTED BY DIFFERENT PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF MATERIALS; REGIONAL, REPRESENTED BY THE TYPE OF ELECTRICITY MIX USED IN THE PRODUCTION AND THE NATIONAL TRANSPORT AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL; AND LOCAL, REPRESENTED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS, SUCH AS SEISMIC AND WIND RISK ZONES AT THE CITY LEVEL. A COMPARATIVE LCA WAS USED AS CASE STUDY TO TEST THE METHODOLOGY. THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT FOR THE LCA WAS DEFINED AS AN 18 M(2) CORE SHELTER UNIT CONSISTING OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS ONLY. THE BILL OF MATERIALS FOR FIVE DESIGNS WERE CALCULATED, EACH USING A DISTINCTIVE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL: BAMBOO, BRICK, CONCRETE HOLLOW BLOCK, FERRO-CEMENT PANELS, AND SOIL-STABILISED BRICKS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS' VARIABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE RESULTS. THE EFFECT OF THE EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS (EARTHQUAKES AND WIND) WERE ANALYSED, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OVER THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE WAS ASSESSED. FIVE HOUSE DESIGNS WERE CALCULATED IN TWENTY LOCATIONS BASED ON THREE LEVELS OF PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND THREE TRANSPORT DISTANCE RANGES FOR EACH COUNTRY. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE RESULTS OF THE BAMBOO, CONCRETE HOLLOW BLOCK AND FERRO-CEMENT HOUSES OVERLAPPED AND CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS' TRANSPORT DISTANCE. THEREFORE, THE LEVEL OF IMPACT OF AN AVERAGE BAMBOO HOUSE CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED BY A HIGH-PERFORMANCE BLOCK OR FERRO-CEMENT HOUSE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT IN MOST CASES, THE BUILDINGS WITH HIGH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. CONCLUSIONS THE USE OF GIS ENABLES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTERIZED LCIA DATA FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND BUILDINGS WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED APPROACH WAS ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE RANGE OF PRODUCTION PRACTICES USED OUTSIDE EUROPE. FINALLY, THE USE OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ALLOWS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF BUILDING IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN WHEN UNCERTAINTY IS AT ITS HIGHEST, THEREBY IDENTIFYING THE IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL OF EACH DESIGN AND RECOGNISING THE STRUCTURAL NEEDS IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH; SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN; ETH ZURICH",NA,"EDWIN.ZEA@CCRS.UZH.CH",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-016-1238-y","FA2TD","1614-7502",NA,NA,"HILTI AG","THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER WOULD LIKE TO THANK HILTI AG FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP OF THIS RESEARCH.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

IN LUXEMBOURG, SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES DOMINATE THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS, NOTICEABLY CONTRIBUTING TO CONSTRUCTION WASTE AND CO2 EMISSIONS. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A THREESTORY REINFORCED CONCRETE MASONRY SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE AND AN IDENTICAL TIMBER BUILDING IN LUXEMBOURG, EMPHASIZING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND EMBODIED ENERGY. A CRADLE -TO -GRAVE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) MODELS TO ANALYZE THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND PRIMARY ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS FROM THE PRODUCERS AND THE CENTER DOT OKOBAUDAT GERMAN DATABASE WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE MATERIALS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TIMBER BUILDING OUTPERFORMS THE CONCRETE BUILDING WITH A 43.5\% LOWER GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, WHILE THE CONCRETE BUILDING DEMONSTRATES A 15.6\% REDUCTION IN PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND. THIS ALIGNS WITH THE AVERAGE OUTCOMES OF SEVEN SIMILAR STUDIES DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER, AT 33.2\% AND 4.7\%, RESPECTIVELY. MOREOVER, THE TIMBER BUILDING IS 78.6\% LIGHTER THAN THE CONCRETE ONE. WHEN EVALUATING BENEFITS AND LOADS BEYOND THE SYSTEM BOUNDARY, THE TIMBER BUILDING PROVIDES 3.6 AND 4 TIMES GREATER ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND PRIMARY ENERGY, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE REINFORCED CONCRETE MASONRY BUILDING. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDY EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF REUSING THE FLOORS IN THE TIMBER BUILDING.

ADOPTING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING TOOLS AND IMPLEMENTING THEM INTO LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AT THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR BUILDINGS SUSTAINABILITY EVALUATION. WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT CONSTANTLY CHANGING, IT IS REASONABLE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SHOULD ALSO AIM TO ADAPT TO THESE CHANGES AND USE THEM. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF LOCAL CLIMATE FEATURES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON A BUILDING'S ENERGY OUTPUT IS OFTEN NEGLECTED. BY USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING-LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO CONSIDER THE ROLE OF CLIMATIC ATTRIBUTES ALONG WITH SOME PASSIVE DESIGN STRATEGIES IN THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF THE BUILDING AND SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THAT BUILDING'S ENERGY PERFORMANCE. BY ONLY APPLYING PASSIVE DESIGN STRATEGIES (NOT INCLUDING HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM TYPE), THE MODELS' ENERGY DEMAND WAS REDUCED UP TO 30\% OF THE ORIGINAL VALUE. IT IS ALSO WITNESSED THAT BY USING THE PROPER EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT MATCH THE RESPECTIVE CLIMATE, UP TO 28\% OF THE BUILDING'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE, CAN BE SAVED. ALTHOUGH INSULATION OF THE WALLS DOES REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION VALUES, IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE INCREASE IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND 3\%, BUT SINCE THE INSULATION BOARDS MAKE UP ONLY 2\% OF THE BUILDING'S AREA, IT IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT.","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","IRAN UNIVERSITY SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; IRAN UNIVERSITY SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY",NA,"SHIRZAD@IUST.AC.IR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1177/0958305X221145923","TB9M0","2048-4070","DEC 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0958-305X","ENERGY ENVIRON.","ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT","ENGLISH","JUN",NA,"49","4",NA,"SHIRZADI JAVID, ALI AKBAR/0000-0002-6105-5991",NA,"2087-2106","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","SHIRZADI JAVID, ALI AKBAR/Q-3934-2018",NA,1,"INTEGRATING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF CLIMATE AND PASSIVE DESIGN PARAMETERS IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION","ARTICLE","WOS000905618700001","3","20","35","ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2024,"FALEGARI SAHAR;JAVID ALI AKBAR SHIRZADI","JAVID, AAS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), IRAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL ENGN, POB 16765-163, TEHRAN 16844, IRAN","ISI","ENERGY ENVIRON","IRAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;IRAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;IRAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL","IRAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL",NA,"FALEGARI S, 2024, ENERGY ENVIRON","FALEGARI S, 2024, ENERGY ENVIRON",NA

HOWEVER, EACH DESIGN SOLUTION HAS ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE BUILDING. THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CAN BE PROFITABLY ADOPTED FOR SUPPORTING THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THIS PAPER REPORTS A COMPARATIVE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED TO ANALYSE THE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS FOR TIMBER-BASED HIGH-RISE STRUCTURES. EMBODIED, OPERATIONAL, AND ENDOF-LIFE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BASED ON TWO STRUCTURAL FRAME TYPES, A REINFORCED CONCRETE (RC) STRUCTURE AND CROSS-LAMINATED TIMBER (CLT) ARE EXPLORED. TWO MAIN INPUTS ARE USED FOR PERFORMING A COMPREHENSIVE CRADLE-TOGRAVE LCA FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING: THE BILL OF QUANTITIES FROM A REVIT BIM MODEL AND THE ENERGY DEMAND FROM DESIGNSTUDIO. THEN, AN LCA IS PERFORMED USING THE ONE CLICK LCA TOOL FOR A SERVICE LIFE OF 50 YEARS AND 12 IMPACT CATEGORIES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS ARE BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPDS) DIRECTLY EMBEDDED IN THE TOOL. THE METHOD IS THEN APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY IN AALBORG, DENMARK. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FOR THE CONSIDERED CASE STUDY ARE 9.6 KG- CO2 EQ./M2/Y FOR THE CLT STRUCTURE AGAINST 10.8 KG- CO2 EQ./M2/Y FOR THE RC STRUCTURE. THE PRODUCTION STAGE OF BUILDING MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUILDING SYSTEMS AND INSTALLATIONS, ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 55\% OF THE TOTAL EMISSIONS, WHILE ENERGY USE (B6 PHASE) DURING THE IN-USE STAGE OF THE BUILDING RECORDED A LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (45\%). THE OUTCOMES CONFIRM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BASE THE DISCUSSION ON ALTERNATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS ON MORE OBJECTIVE AND DATA-BASED ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS WHICH ALREADY INVOLVE A WIDE RANGE OF ARCHITECTURAL, FUNCTIONAL AND FINANCIAL CRITERIA. THIS IS OF GREAT RELEVANCE IN ACHIEVING BALANCED AND INFORMED DECISIONS WHICH DO NOT SIMPLY FOLLOW GREEN-LABELLED IDEAS BUT ARE GROUNDED ON EVIDENCE-BASED CONSIDERATIONS.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY PRAGUE; CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY PRAGUE; UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA","113557","LICIA.FELICIONI@CVUT.CZ JACOPO.GASPARI@UNIBO.IT JAKUB.VESELKA@CVUT.CZ ZDENKO.MALIK@CVUT.CZ",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113557","U4ST2","1872-6178","SEP 2023",NA,"CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE [1612307A124]; (UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS) [8941501V001]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE [GRANT NUMBER 1612307A124 (FACULTY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING) AND INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS 8941501V001 (UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS) ] .

RESEARCH STUDIES USUALLY FACE CHALLENGES IN PRESENTING COMPREHENSIVE LCA RESULTS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ASSESSMENTS AT THE BUILDING LEVEL. THERE IS A DEARTH OF METHODS FOR THE SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE WBLCA PERFORMANCE AT THE DESIGN STAGE. THE STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE PROPOSED WBLCA METHOD TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AT THE BUILDING LEVEL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE WBLCA DEVELOPMENT METHOD IS PROPOSED WITH DETAILED PROCESSES BASED ON THE EN 15978 STANDARD. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION (EPD) METHODS WERE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THE WBLCA IS COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WAS USED TO ENSURE THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACCURATE AND PROVIDE DYNAMIC MATERIAL UPDATES FOR THE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, THE INTERACTIVE BIM-LCA CALCULATION PROCESSES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR MEASURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DESIGN UPGRADES. THE TOPSIS-BASED LCA RESULTS NORMALIZATION WAS SELECTED TO CONDUCT THE COMPARISONS OF VARIOUS BUILDING DESIGN UPGRADES. FINDINGS THE CASE STUDY CONDUCTED FOR A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING SHOWED THAT THE MATERIAL EMBODIED IMPACTS AND THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE IMPACTS ARE THE TWO CRITICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE 60-90\% OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND RESOURCE USES. CONCRETE AND WOOD ARE THE MAIN MATERIAL TYPES ACCOUNTING FOR AN AVERAGE OF 65\% OF THE MATERIAL EMBODIED IMPACTS. THE AIR AND WATER HEATING FOR THE HOUSE ARE THE MAIN ENERGY FACTORS, AS THESE ACCOUNT FOR OVER 80\% OF THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE. BASED ON THE ORIGINAL WBLCA RESULTS, TWO SCENARIOS WERE ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE BUILDING PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE LCA RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TWO UPGRADED BUILDING DESIGNS CREATE AN AVERAGE OF 5\% REDUCTION COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL BUILDING DESIGN AND IMPROVING THE THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF THE HOUSE WITH MORE INSULATION MATERIALS DOES NOT ALWAYS REDUCE THE WBLCA RESULTS. THE PROPOSED WBLCA METHOD CAN BE USED TO COMPARE THE BUILDING-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCES WITH THE SIMILAR BUILDING TYPES. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT BUILDING DESIGNERS TO EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE WBLCA PERFORMANCE.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","NORTHUMBRIA UNIVERSITY",NA,"HAIBO.FENG@NORTHUMBRIA.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/IJBPA-06-2021-0091","9S0CK",NA,"JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2398-4708","INT.

BUILDINGS DETERIORATE WITH AGE, WHICH LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THEIR ENERGY PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO IMPROVE THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF AGING BUILDING BLOCK ALTHOUGH IT IS CHALLENGING. THE TWO MAIN DECISION PATHS FOR MUNICIPALITIES ARE RENOVATION AND RECONSTRUCTION. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ABOVE OPTIONS FOR THE OLDER HOUSING STOCK IN A DENSELY POPULATED URBAN CENTRE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. A SCENARIO-BASED ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS TAKEN TO EVALUATE THE LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF SIX DIFFERENT RENOVATION AND RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS. THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH SCENARIO INCLUDING THE EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL EMISSION, AND THE EMISSIONS FROM BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. A BIM-LCA COMBINED APPROACH WAS USED TO ASSESS THE EMBODIED GHG EMISSIONS WITH THE SIMAPRO SOFTWARE. HOT2000 SOFTWARE WAS USED TO MODEL THE OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS, AROUND 40\% OF THE EMISSIONS ARE FROM THE MATERIAL MANUFACTURING STAGE. THE EMBODIED EMISSIONS GENERATED FROM THE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS ARE 5-6 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RENOVATION SCENARIOS. THE LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF THE EXISTING HOUSE CAN BE REDUCED BY APPLYING RENOVATIONS, WITH THE EMISSIONS SAVING GRADUALLY INCREASING WITH THE LEVEL OF RETROFITTING. THE PASSIVE HOUSE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIO DELIVERS THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS REDUCTION COMPARED TO ALL OTHER SCENARIOS. IN TERMS OF THE GHG EMISSION INTENSITY PER UNIT AREA, THE NEWLY-BUILT HOUSES IN SCENARIOS 5 AND 6 ALSO HAVE LOWER LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSION PER SQUARE METER THAN THE RENOVATED EXISTING HOUSES IN SCENARIO 1-4 AFTER 15 AND 10 YEARS TO BREAKEVEN RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THIS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE OLDER EXISTING BUILDING STOCK, A CAREFUL WEIGHING OF OPTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION ON REPLACING THEM WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS TO RENOVATE OR REPLACE EXISTING HOUSES. THE STUDY OUTCOMES WILL SUPPORT CITY PLANNERS AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PLANNERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON BC AGING BUILDING STOCK DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH POPULATION DENSITY NEIGHBOURHOODS.

HOWEVER, THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF CLCA ENCOUNTERS CHALLENGES DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF COMMON GUIDELINES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDIED DIFFERENT SETS OF LITERATURE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLCA OF PLANT PROTEIN EXTRACTION THROUGH FRACTIONATION, USING CANADA AS AN EXAMPLE. GIVEN THAT ECONOMIC MODELS ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF CLCA, THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC MODELS EMPLOYED IN 18 CLCA STUDIES, SHEDDING LIGHT ON THEIR RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. NOTABLY, THE STUDY IDENTIFIES THE USE OF BOTH COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM AND PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELS FOR ENABLING THE ANALYSIS OF LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM CHANGES. THE ESTIMATION OF LAND USE CHANGES (BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT) IS AN INTEGRAL PART AND ECONOMIC MODELS ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN QUANTIFYING INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGES. FOR CHARACTERIZING THE COMMON MODELLING PRACTICES IN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR, 33 CLCA STUDIES WERE REVIEWED TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ON THE DECISION CONTEXT, TIME HORIZON, IDENTIFICATION OF MARGINAL/SUBSTITUTABLE MARKETS, UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES, ETC. `INCREASED SUPPLY' AND `INCREASED DEMAND' ARE BOTH FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT DECISION CONTEXTS. IT IS A COMMON PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY MARGINAL MARKETS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, LITERATURE, AND OTHER SOURCES ALONG WITH EMPLOYING ECONOMIC MODELS FOR SOME CASES. HOWEVER, ECONOMIC MODELS IN THE AGRI-FOOD STUDIES WERE USED MORE OFTEN FOR ESTIMATING LAND USE CHANGE IMPACTS. TO ELABORATE THE CASE STUDY OF PLANT PROTEIN EXTRACTION (I.E., PEA FRACTIONATION), SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE USES OF THE CO-PRODUCTS OF PEA FRACTIONATION PROCESSES AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING PROBABLE MARGINAL MARKETS WERE IDENTIFIED. BUILDING UPON THESE FINDINGS, THE REVIEW CULMINATES IN THE PROPOSAL OF A DETAILED METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLCA APPLIED TO PEA FRACTIONATION, INCORPORATING CONSIDERATIONS OF MARGINAL MARKETS THAT REVOLVE AROUND UTILIZING CO-PRODUCTS LIKE PEA STARCH AND PEA FIBRE. FUTURE RESEARCH COULD FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING MARGINAL MARKETS RELEVANT TO THE CANADIAN LANDSCAPE, THEREBY ENHANCING THE APPLICABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF CLCA WITHIN THIS REGION.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA",NA,"JANNATUL.FERDOUS@UBC.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.spc.2024.07.031","D4D0C",NA,"AUG 2024",NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA (CSTIP) [SPP121]","THIS WORK WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA (CSTIP GRANT AGREEMENT \#SPP121) UNDER THE SUSTAINABLE PROTEIN PRO-DUCTION (SPP) PROGRAM.",NA,"2352-5509","SUSTAIN.

FOR SUCH, ENERGY SIMULATIONS WERE RUN IN BIM SOFTWARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF A CASE STUDY IN PORTUGAL. TYPICAL ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS WERE TESTED AGAINST THE ORIGINAL CASE STUDY, AND SOLUTIONS WITH CONSIDERABLY LOWER U-VALUE CONSIDERING THE CODE FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS (0,7 W/M2 DEGREES K FOR WALLS AND 0,5 W/M2.DEGREES K FOR ROOFS). TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENVELOPE SOLUTIONS, THE PAYBACK PERIOD, THE NET PRESENT VALUE AND THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN AT 15 YEARS AND 50 YEARS WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOLUTIONS WITH LOWER U-VALUES ARE RELATED TO 2-5\% SAVINGS IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CAN BE COST-EFFECTIVE AT 15 AND 50 YEARS, NAMELY VACUUM INSULATION PANELS OF 2.5 CM AND SANDWICH PANELS OF 8-12 CM.

HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL LCSA APPLICATIONS ARE TYPICALLY CONFINED TO THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES OF BUILDING PROJECTS, WHERE THEY ASSESS THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF A BUILDING USING STATIC HISTORICAL DATA RATHER THAN BEING EMPLOYED AS A DECISION-MAKING TOOL THROUGHOUT ALL PROJECT PHASES WITH REAL-TIME DATA INTEGRATION. THIS RESEARCH ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS BY INVESTIGATING THE INTEGRATION OF LCSA WITH DIGITAL TWIN (DT) AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENTS IN BUILDING PROJECTS. THE PRIMARY AIM IS TO DEVELOP A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES REALTIME DATA ACROSS A BUILDING'S ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE. THIS STUDY UTILIZES A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW TO IDENTIFY CURRENT TRENDS AND GAPS, LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK VALIDATED THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT INTEGRATING DT FACILITATES CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS, WHILE BLOCKCHAIN ENSURES DATA SECURITY, INTEGRITY, AND TRANSPARENCY. THIS NOVEL APPROACH SUPPORTS REAL-TIME, ITERATIVE LCSA APPLICATIONS, ENHANCING DECISION-MAKING FROM DESIGN THROUGH CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. BY SHOWCASING A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF DT AND BLOCKCHAIN IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS, THIS FRAMEWORK SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCES SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN CONSTRUCTION. THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS RESEARCH LIES IN ITS HOLISTIC APPROACH, COMBINING DT AND BLOCKCHAIN TO DELIVER A MORE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, AND COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT MODEL, SETTING A NEW STANDARD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO DE JANEIRO; WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY","111018","KAROLINEFIGUEIREDO@POLI.UFRJ.BR AWA.HAMMAD@GMAIL.COM RPIEROTT@POLI.UFRJ.BR V.TAM@WESTERNSYDNEY.EDU.AU ASSED@POLI.UFRJ.BR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2024.111018","J3S4T","2352-7102",NA,NA,"COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR-BRASIL (CAPES) [001]","THIS STUDY WAS FINANCED IN PART BY THE COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR-BRASIL (CAPES) - FINANCE CODE 001.",NA,NA,"J.

A COMMON MISCONCEPTION IS TO CONSIDER SUSTAINABILITY AS ONLY CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE FRAMEWORK THAT IS COMPRISED OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. MATERIAL CHOICE IS KNOWN TO IMPACT BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY DIRECTLY SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS CAN DRAMATICALLY ALTER THE FOOTPRINT GENERATED OVER THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE BUILDING. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS NOT YET EQUIPPED WITH APPROACHES THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR ALL THREE ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO DECIDING ON MATERIALS TO ADOPT. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK FOR CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS AND RESEARCHERS INVOLVING THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA), MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS (MCDA), AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TO CHOOSE SUITABLE MATERIALS FOR BUILDINGS. THE FRAMEWORK IS BUILT BASED ON A LITERATURE REVIEW OF RELEVANT PAPERS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL FACTORS AND CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING THIS INTEGRATION. THE FUZZY ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS WAS CHOSEN AS THE MCDA METHOD WITHIN THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, GIVEN THAT THE PROBLEM OF MATERIAL CHOICE OFTEN CONTAINS SUBJECTIVITY, UNCERTAINTY, AND AMBIGUITY, WHICH IS BEST SOLVED WITH FUZZY LOGIC.

IT FOCUSES ON CURRENT RESEARCH TRENDS, AND ELABORATES ON GAPS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY CURRENT RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS OF LCA IN BUILDINGS. THE PROPOSED REVIEW METHODOLOGY INCLUDES (I) IDENTIFYING RECENT AUTHORITATIVE RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS USING ESTABLISHED SEARCH ENGINES, (II) SCREENING AND RETAINING RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS, AND (III) EXTRACTING RELEVANT LCA APPLICATIONS FOR BUILDINGS AND ANALYZING THEIR UNDERPINNING RESEARCH. SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL RESEARCH GAPS AND LIMITATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED, WHICH HAVE INFORMED OUR PROPOSED FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT HUMANS CAN ATTENUATE AND POSITIVELY CONTROL THE IMPACT OF THEIR BUILDINGS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, AND AS SUCH MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY A NEW GENERATION OF LCA METHODS AND TOOLS THAT ARE MODEL BASED AND CONTINUOUSLY LEARN FROM REAL-TIME DATA, WHILE INFORMING EFFECTIVE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF BUILDINGS AND DISTRICTS. THEREFORE, THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TIME DIMENSION IN PRODUCT SYSTEM MODELING IS BECOMING ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE RESULTING POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. THIS TIME DIMENSION IS CURRENTLY MISSING IN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATABASES. A FURTHER COMBINATION OF LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) MODELS USING TIME-DEPENDENT CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS CAN LEAD TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE LCA RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THIS PAPER PROMOTES THE CONCEPT OF SEMANTIC-BASED DYNAMIC (REAL-TIME) LCA, WHICH ADDRESSES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN THE LOCAL BUILT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ECOSYSTEM, AND THUS MORE EFFECTIVELY PROMOTES A ``CRADLE-TO-GRAVE-TO-REINCARNATION'' ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY CAPABILITY.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOFTWARE TOOL TO SIMULATE THE LIFECYCLE COSTS OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. IT IS A PART OF THE ND MODELLING TOOL DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO BASED ON THE OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OF THE ND MODELLING TOOL. ND MODELLING AIMS TO INTEGRATE A NUMBER OF DESIGN DIMENSIONS INTO A HOLISTIC MODEL, WHICH WOULD ENABLE USERS TO PORTRAY AND VISUALLY PROJECT THE BUILDING DESIGN OVER ITS COMPLETE LIFECYCLE. THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURE OF THE ND MODELLING TOOL IS BASED UPON IFC MODELS, WHICH ARE VISUALIZED IN AN INTEGRATED AND INTERACTIVE USER INTERFACE. THUS, THIS TOOL CAN INHERIT DESIGN INFORMATION THROUGH IFC MODELS, WHICH MAY BE CONVERTED FROM THE DESIGN DRAWINGS GENERATED IN VARIOUS CAD SYSTEMS. THIS LIFECYCLE COSTING TOOL PROVIDES USERS WITH THE OPTIONS OF DIFFERENT BUILDING MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTING METHODS ON INDIVIDUAL BUILDING COMPONENTS. DESIGNERS CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS BASED ON THE LIFECYCLE COST PERFORMANCE OF THESE MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTING METHODS. THE DETAILED MAINTENANCE COSTS ACROSS THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE AND THE COST COMPONENTS ARE CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED IN CHARTS AND TABLES. SOME KEY PARAMETERS OF LIFECYCLE COSTING CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED, AND THE DYNAMIC CHANGES OF THE LIFECYCLE COSTS CAN ALSO BE REVEALED IN THE CHARTS AND TABLES PROMPTLY.

THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A FUZZY LOGIC SYSTEM IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MAPPING DATA. THE RESULT OF THE PROTOTYPE CONCLUDES THAT FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHMS WITH EASE CAN BE USED IN A COLLABORATIVE CONTEXT. THE STUDY IMPLIES THAT THE AEC INDUSTRY'S LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCE AND PURITY ARE A LIMITATION ON USING FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHMS. THE RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT THE FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHM USED IN PARALLEL CONSTELLATION MAY CAUSE BAD RESULTS, AND THE RELEGATION OR EXCLUSION OF DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.

THE STUDY LOOKS AT A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, APPLYING AN AUTOMATIC CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS TOOL OF UPFRONT EMBODIED CARBON AND BIM-BASED LIFECYCLE ENERGY SIMULATION TO PREDICT CARBON EMISSIONS FROM OPERATING THE BUILT SPACES. A PARAMETRIC BIM MODEL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO AID ENERGY SIMULATION AND OPERATIONAL CARBON ASSESSMENT ACROSS A 50-YEAR BUILDING LIFETIME, CONSIDERING 1.5 DEGREES C NET-ZERO WORLD AND 3 DEGREES C HOT HOUSE WORLD CLIMATE SCENARIOS. VARIOUS IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, FROM MATERIAL SELECTION TO OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, ARE EXPLORED. THIS INCLUDES QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS ON ARCHITECTURAL-STRUCTURE DESIGN, LOW-CARBON CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (E.G., CEMENT SUBSTITUTES, STEEL SCRAPS, AND GREEN HYDROGEN STEEL), AND NOVEL DESIGN FOR CONSTRUCTION APPROACHES (SUCH AS MODULAR INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION), WITH DISCUSSION AROUND THEIR IMPACTS ON OPTIMISING THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE CARBON PERFORMANCE.

HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES TRANSACTIONS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF INFORMATION WHILE THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ``BUILDING PASSPORT'' APPROACH REMAINS UNSOLVED TO DATE. CONSIDERING THE LONG SERVICE LIFE OF BUILDINGS, VARIOUS QUESTIONS ARISE: (1) HOW TO SUPPORT DATA GENERATION AND STORAGE WITHIN THE LIFE CYCLE AND HOW TO ENCOURAGE ACTORS TO COMPETE? (2) HOW TO ASSURE A HIGH DATA QUALITY AND HOW TO STORE IT OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME? (3) HOW TO ASSURE THAT ALL DATA USERS CAN TRACK DOWN THE DATA OWNERS AT ANY POINT OF TIME TO MANAGE COMPLIANCE AND LEGAL ISSUES? (4) ARE THERE ANY NEW BUSINESS MODELS OR NEW SCOPES FOR DESIGNERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS? INFORMATION NEEDS OF ACTORS ALONG THE LIFE CYCLE ARE ANALYSED AND NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (E.G. BLOCKCHAIN) ARE DISCUSSED. A RELATION TO BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) IS SHOWN. POTENTIALS OF ENHANCING EXISTING APPROACHES REGARDING DOCUMENTATION RETRACING AND ACCESSIBILITY OF BUILDING AND LIFE CYCLE RELATED INFORMATION BY USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IT ARE DISCUSSED; BENEFITS OF USING A BLOCKCHAIN BASED SYSTEM IS POINTED OUT BY REFERRING TO EXISTING PILOT PROJECTS AND FIRST EXAMPLES.

TO ADAPT TO THIS PROBLEMATIC ISSUE, A MIXED-USE HOSPITAL FUNCTIONING SYSTEM FOR NORMAL AND EPIDEMIC SITUATIONS IS PROPOSED. HOWEVER, THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY OF A HOSPITAL EMBEDDED WITH A FUNCTION OF EPIDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL RENDERS A RESTRAINED CONSTRUCTION PROCESS THAT MAY COMPROMISE QUALITY. IN THIS STANCE, WE DEVELOPED A BIM (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING)-BASED SIMULATION APPROACH ADDRESSING LIFE-CYCLE QUALITY CONTROL IN POST-PANDEMIC HOSPITALS. AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDY APPROACH, WHICH DRAWS ON THE GREY LITERATURE, WAS USED TO ADDRESS THE RESEARCH QUESTION. BIM FORWARD DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED TO INTEGRATE WITH SUCH ELEMENTS AS FUNCTIONAL STREAMLINE, EMERGENCY SITE, AND WARD CONVERSION IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION FROM NORMAL TO EPIDEMIC-RELATED OPERATIONS. COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS-BASED FLUID SIMULATION WAS CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN THE MOST SUITABLE AIR SUPPLY AND EXHAUST SOLUTIONS FOR NEGATIVE PRESSURE WARDS. BIM FORWARD DESIGN METHOD CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVING DESIGN EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. THE RESULTS OF VENTILATION SIMULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE DESIGN SCHEME MET ALL THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. MEANWHILE, THE BEST PIPELINE SYNTHESIS SCHEME WAS OBTAINED, WHICH REDUCED THE REWORK AND SAVED ON CONSTRUCTION TIME. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF DESIGN INFORMATION SHARING AND BUSINESS COLLABORATION. IMPLICATIONS GENERATED FROM THIS STUDY CAN BE USED AS A SIGNIFICANT REFERENCE FOR THE FUTURE CONSTRUCTION OF VARIOUS HEALTHCARE FACILITIES.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","1549","JIANGZEHAO@HUST.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings13061549","K1TC2","2075-5309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","JUN",NA,"28","6","GOLD","JIANG, ZE HAO/0000-0002-1824-1449",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","LUO, MING/IUQ-5321-2023 ",NA,1,"A BIM-BASED SIMULATION APPROACH FOR LIFE-CYCLE QUALITY CONTROL IN POST-PANDEMIC HOSPITALS","ARTICLE","WOS001014328000001","4","22","13","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"GAO SI;XIE HU;YANG MIAN;ZHANG QIANG;ZHANG MING; WANG XIN;JIANG ZE-HAO","JIANG, ZH (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), HUAZHONG UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL \& HYDRAUL ENGN, WUHAN 430074, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","HUAZHONG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;CENT SOUTH ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN INST CO LTD;HUAZHONG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL","HUAZHONG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL",NA,"GAO S, 2023, BUILDINGS-BASEL","GAO S, 2023, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

THE PROCESS OF USING RAW DATA TO DERIVE LCC COMPONENTS IS THEN DISCUSSED. FINALLY, A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK.

IT IS CRUCIAL TO QUANTIFY THE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFABRICATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH UTILIZING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS TO EXAMINE AND VISUALIZE GHG EMISSIONS IN PREFABRICATION. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, THIS STUDY EMPLOYED A MULTI -INFORMATION METHOD THAT COMBINES BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) WITH A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) APPROACH TO ANALYZE AND CALCULATE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF GHG EMISSIONS FROM PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS AND BUILDINGS DURING THE PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, AND CONSTRUCTION STAGES IN CHINA. THE RESULTS INDICATE THE FOLLOWING: (1) GHG EMISSIONS PER CUBIC METER FOR THE PREFABRICATED EXTERIOR WALL, BALCONY, AND STAIR ARE 1080.77 KGCO2EQ/M3, 867.84 KGCO2EQ/M3, AND 1902.63 KGCO2EQ/M3, RESPECTIVELY, WITH AN OVERALL AVERAGE OF 1138.58 KGCO2EQ/M3 FOR PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS. (2) THE PRODUCTION PHASE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST SHARE OF GHG EMISSIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR 96.11\%, WHILE THE TRANSPORTATION AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES CONTRIBUTE 3.30\% AND 0.59\% OF THE TOTAL EMISSIONS, RESPECTIVELY. (3) THE SELECTION OF PRE-FABRICATED CONSTRUCTION CAN LEAD TO A 31.62\% REDUCTION IN TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS PER SQUARE METER, WITH EMISSIONS OF 269.16 KGCO2EQ/M2, COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION WITH EMISSIONS OF 393.63 KGCO2EQ/M2. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE BODY BY PROVIDING A SYSTEMATIC METHOD FOR CALCULATING GHG EMISSIONS AND OFFERING TRACEABILITY AND VISIBILITY OF GHG EMISSIONS FOR PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS AND PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS. THESE FINDINGS CAN SERVE AS PRACTICAL REFERENCES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO ACHIEVE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY'S GREEN AND LOW -CARBON GOALS.","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","SHENZHEN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY","107330","GYYSZU@GMAIL.COM WANGJY@SZU.EDU.CN KENNETH.YIU@UNSW.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.eiar.2023.107330","Y9OZ8","1873-6432","OCT 2023",NA,"NATIONAL NAT- URAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71772125]","THIS RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL NAT- URAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (GRANT NO. 71772125) .",NA,"0195-9255","ENVIRON.

HOWEVER, THE LCA PROCESS REQUIRES EXTENSIVE TIME AND EFFORT WHEN APPLIED TO SYSTEMS AS COMPLEX AS THE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDINGS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PLATFORMS OFFERS INTERESTING OPPORTUNITIES TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR DRAWING UP LCAS IN THE CASE OF BUILDINGS. RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE USE OF BIM-BASED METHODS LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TIME AND EFFORT WHICH PRACTITIONERS DEDICATE TO APPLYING THE LCA METHODOLOGY TO ENTIRE BUILDINGS. LCA PHASES SUCH AS LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, TRADITIONALLY EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING, IS ALMOST SELF-OPERATING WHEN BIM RESOURCES ARE IN USE. THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION OF LCA ELABORATION COULD BE OPTIMIZED BY USING A) THE PROGRAMMING POSSIBILITIES WITHIN THE BIM PLATFORM FRAMEWORK; AND B) THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE MODELS FOR ANALYSIS. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THESE TWO FIELDS, BASED ON A LINE OF RESEARCH PROPOSED BY THE MASTER'S IN INNOVATION IN ARCHITECTURE: TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLE. THERE HAS BEEN A CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE INTEGRATED IN BIM. MANY REGIONS HAVE ENCOURAGED COUNTRIES TO USE BIM PLATFORMS WHEN DOCUMENTING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. THIS NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE LIFE CYCLE OF NUMEROUS BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT, OBTAINING SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENCHMARKS FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES. THIS COMMUNICATION DESCRIBES A METHOD PROPOSED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENCHMARKS, - SUCH AS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND - FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DWELLINGS USING LCA METHODOLOGY AND BIM PLATFORMS. THE APPLICATION OF THIS APPROACH TO DIFFERENT CASE STUDIES IS PRESENTED.

AMONG MANY ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, THE HOUSING SECTOR REMAINS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. HOWEVER, A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE STILL REMAINS AN AREA OF CONCERN. MOST OF THE STUDY DOES NOT ASSESS THE IMPACTS BY EACH PHASE OF LIFECYCLE. THE CURRENT WORK PRESENTS A COMPLETE APPROACH FOR CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSESSMENT INCLUDING PLANNING, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATIONAL, MAINTENANCE AND DISMANTLING \& DISPOSE-OFF PHASE. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) WITH BOUNDARY LIMITATIONS OF `CRADLE TO GRAVE' WAS ADOPTED. THIRTEEN HOUSING UNITS WERE SELECTED AS CASE STUDY. THESE INCLUDED DETACHED, SEMI-DETACHED AND TERRACED TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION. SELECTED UNITS WERE DEVELOPED IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM). THE STUDY OBSERVED THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION RANGE FROM 1.48 TONS-CO2/YR TO 2.85 TONS-CO2/YR. ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE EXECUTION PHASE DOMINATED THE FIVE PHASES WITH ALMOST 43 \%. THE OPERATIONAL PHASE SHARED 39 \% FOLLOWED BY MAINTENANCE (15 \%), DISMANTLING \& DISPOSE-OFF (1.8 \%) AND PLANNING AT THE LAST (1.5 \%). THE CATEGORIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INTO EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OBSERVED THE EMBODIED PART IN DOMINANCE. A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AREA OF HOUSING UNITS AND RESULTING CARBON IMPACT WAS ALSO OBSERVED. THE WORK PRESENTS ONE OF FEW ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FOR A TROPICAL HOUSING SECTOR ASSESSING COMPLETE LIFE CYCLE. THE STUDY PROVIDES A VITAL GUIDELINE TO THE DESIGNERS FOR ENSURING A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT BY ASSESSING AND OPTING LESS CARBON INTENSIVE OPTIONS AT EARLY STAGE OF PLANNING AND DESIGN.","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND","CAPITAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS; UNIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING \& TECHNOLOGY TAXILA",NA,"DR.SHUJAASAFDAR@CUST.EDU.PK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.2478/rtuect-2021-0076","XP9AP","2255-8837",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1691-5208","ENVIRON.

TO IDENTIFY THE BEST DESIGN, A HOLISTIC APPROACH IS NECESSARY, CONSIDERING EMISSIONS, ENERGY USE, DIRECT COSTS, POTENTIAL EARTHQUAKE COSTS, ETC. ACCORDINGLY, THIS PAPER ADDRESSES A MULTITUDE OF LIFECYCLE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURING, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATIONS, DAMAGE, AND DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS. ALL IMPACTS ARE TRANSLATED INTO A COMMON UTILITY, MEASURED IN DOLLARS. A COLLECTION OF COST MODELS IS DEVELOPED, AND DETAILED BUILDING MODELS ARE CREATED FROM BIM, I.E., BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING. A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED FOR A SIX-STORY BUILDING. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STEEL MATERIAL OPTION RESULTS IN THE LOWEST CONSTRUCTION COST. THE WOOD OPTION RESULTS IN THE LOWEST COST OF EMISSIONS, WHILE THE CONCRETE OPTION CONTRIBUTES THE MOST TO CLIMATE CHANGE. EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 3\% OF THE TOTAL EXPECTED COST, BUT THE WORST-CASE EARTHQUAKE COST EXCEEDS THE BUILDING VALUE.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA",NA,"STEVA44@HOTMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/23789689.2020.1846236","CF5A2","2378-9697",NA,NA,"UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA; NATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA (NSERC)","THE FIRST AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR FUNDING THROUGH THE FOUR YEAR DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP (4YF).

AS A RESULT, LIFE CYCLE MODELS ARE OFTEN DEVELOPED IN AN AD HOC MANNER, AND ARE DIFFICULT TO COMPARE. SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS MAY BE INADVERTENTLY LEFT OUT. OVERCOMING THIS SHORTCOMING CAN HELP ELICIT GREATER CONFIDENCE IN LIFE CYCLE MODELS AND THEIR USE FOR DECISION MAKING. METHODS THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A FRAMEWORK FOR HYBRID LIFE CYCLE MODEL GENERATION BY SELECTING ACTIVITIES BASED ON THEIR IMPORTANCE, PARAMETRIC UNCERTAINTY, AND CONTRIBUTION TO NETWORK COMPLEXITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTIVITIES IS DETERMINED BY STRUCTURAL PATH ANALYSIS-WHICH THEN GUIDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIFE CYCLE MODELS BASED ON UNCERTAINTY AND COMPLEXITY INDICATORS. INFORMATION ABOUT UNCERTAINTY IS FROM THE AVAILABLE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY; COMPLEXITY IS QUANTIFIED BY COST OR GRANULARITY. THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL IS DEVELOPED IN A HIERARCHICAL MANNER BY ADDING THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES UNTIL ERROR REQUIREMENTS ARE SATISFIED OR NETWORK COMPLEXITY EXCEEDS USER-SPECIFIED CONSTRAINTS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE FOR BUILDING A HYBRID LCA MODEL. SINCE THIS IS A CONSTRUCTED EXAMPLE, THE RESULTS CAN BE COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL IMPACT, TO VALIDATE THE APPROACH. THIS APPLICATION DEMONSTRATES HOW THE ALGORITHM SEQUENTIALLY DEVELOPS A LIFE CYCLE MODEL OF ACCEPTABLE UNCERTAINTY AND NETWORK COMPLEXITY. CHALLENGES IN APPLYING THIS FRAMEWORK TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED. CONCLUSION THE PRESENTED ALGORITHM DESIGNS SYSTEM BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCALES OF HYBRID LCA MODELS, INCLUDES OR OMITS ACTIVITIES FROM THE SYSTEM BASED ON PATH ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CONTRIBUTION AT UPSTREAM NETWORK NODES, AND PROVIDES MODEL QUALITY INDICATORS THAT PERMIT COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT LCA MODELS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF OHIO; OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"BAKSHI.2@OSU.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-020-01826-5","OP2HP","1614-7502","OCT 2020",NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [CBET-1804943]; SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","PARTIAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (CBET-1804943) AND THE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

THE ERROR ESTIMATION OF THE KRIGING MODEL IS USED FOR AN ADAPTIVE SEQUENTIAL DESIGN TO IMPROVE THE KRIGING MODEL ACCURACY. A GENETIC ALGORITHM (NSGA-II) IS CONSIDERED EFFICIENT TO FIND THE GLOBAL OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO PROPOSE A NEW ALGORITHM TO REDUCE THE CALCULATION TIME EVEN FURTHER. THE NEW INDIVIDUALS OF THE ADAPTIVE SEQUENTIAL DESIGN ARE FILTERED WITH SATISFACTION FUNCTIONS. IT MEANS THAT ONLY THE USEFUL PART OF THE PARETO FRONT WILL BE DETERMINED.

IN THIS SITUATION BUILDING RELIABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONING ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A UNITED INFORMATION MODEL (BIM-MODEL) INTENDED TO DESCRIBE BUILDING ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE WILL ALLOW TO RAISE THE SUSTAINABILITY, BUT THIS WILL HAPPEN ONLY IF GOALS AND CONCERNS OF ALL PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROJECT PROCESS ARE PROPERLY COORDINATED. AN IMPORTANT FIGURE OF PROCESS SUSTAINABILITY IS THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL RELIABILITY (OTR) THAT DESCRIBES THE POSSIBILITY OF A SYSTEM TO REACH A GOAL. IN CASE OF BUILDING LIFE CYCLE DESIGN, THE ECONOMICAL EFFICIENCY OF A BUILDING CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE GOAL. THE REQUIRED TECHNICAL, ECOLOGICAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND OTHER PARAMETERS FORM A COMPLEX OF CONSTRAINTS THAT DETERMINE THE AREA OF ALLOWABLE VALUES FOR BUILDING FUNCTIONING. IN ITS BROAD MEANING, OTR MAY BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE PROBABILITY OF RECEIVING AN ECONOMICAL EFFECT BASED ON THE VALUE OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND ECONOMICAL RELIABILITY (OER).","17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE","MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING","02018","GINAV@MGSU.RU",NA,"XV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY - 2016","2024-12-23","10.1051/matecconf/20167302018","BG2PC",NA,NA,"MALTSEVA, T",NA,NA,NA,"2261-236X",NA,"XV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY - 2016","ENGLISH",NA,"15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY (TPACEE), TYUMEN STATE UNIV ARCHITECTURE \& CIVIL ENGN, TYUMEN, RUSSIA, APR 27-29, 2016","21",NA,"GOLD, GREEN PUBLISHED",NA,NA,NA,"E D P SCIENCES","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","GINZBURG, ALEXANDER/J-1769-2016","MATEC WEB OF CONFERENCES",7,"SUSTAINABLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE DESIGN","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000387541900047","0","5","73","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2016,"GINZBURG ALEXANDER","GINZBURG, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MOSCOW STATE UNIV CIVIL ENGN, YAROSLAVSKOE SH 26, MOSCOW 129337, RUSSIA","ISI","XV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY - 2016","MOSCOW STATE UNIV CIVIL ENGN;MOSCOW STATE UNIV CIVIL ENGN","MOSCOW STATE UNIV CIVIL ENGN",NA,"GINZBURG A, 2016, XV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY - 2016","GINZBURG A, 2016, XV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TOPICAL PROBLEMS OF ARCHITECTURE, CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ECOLOGY - 2016",NA

DESPITE THEIR ENERGY SAVING POTENTIAL, ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESSED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES AND COMPARES THE LIFE CYCLE COSTS OF A SMART HVAC CONTROL SYSTEM WITH THAT OF A TRADITIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM, IN THE CONTEXT OF AN AUSTRALIAN OFFICE BUILDING. FOR BOTH SYSTEMS, THE REQUIRED HARDWARE ARE SPECIFIED BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE SYSTEMS AND THE LAYOUT OF THE SERVICED SPACES IN THE REFERENCE BUILDING. THE COSTS INCURRED OVER THE PERIOD OF ASSESSMENT ARE QUANTIFIED USING THE NET PRESENT COST (NPC) APPROACH. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONTROL SYSTEMS ON THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY COSTS OF THE BUILDING HVAC SYSTEM, THE CONTROL LOGICS OF BOTH THESE SYSTEMS ARE MODELLED THROUGH BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, OVER THE PERIOD OF ASSESSMENT, THE SMART CONTROL SYSTEM INCURRED A HIGHER TOTAL COST COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS FROM THE SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT THE HVAC ENERGY COST SAVINGS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE SPECIFICATION OF THE SMART CONTROL SYSTEM OFFSET THE ADDITIONAL COST INCURRED TO DEPLOY THIS SYSTEM OVER THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM. THE SMART CONTROL SYSTEM RESULTED IN HVAC OPERATIONAL COST SAVINGS BETWEEN 9 \% AND 10 \% COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COSTS VARIED BETWEEN -27 \% AND +50 \%, WITH THE DISCOUNT RATE AND ENERGY PRICE INCREASE RATE BEING THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PARAMETERS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE; RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","109686","P.GOBINATH@UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2024.109686","UE0U7","2352-7102",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

ONE SUCH APPLICATION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES IS THE REDUCTION OF THE HEATING, VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) ENERGY NEEDS AND GHG EMISSIONS USING SMART CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF SMART CONTROL SYSTEMS DURING BUILDING OPERATION HAVE BEEN EXPLORED IN MANY STUDIES, HOWEVER, THEIR EMBODIED EFFECTS, ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTRACTION OF RAW MATERIALS, MANUFACTURING AND REPLACEMENT ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES THE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY NEEDS AND GHG EMISSIONS OF A SMART HVAC CONTROL SYSTEM AND ASSESSES ITS POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING THE HVAC OPERATIONAL ENERGY AND GHG EMISSIONS IN AN AUSTRALIAN OFFICE BUILDING. A COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED, CONSIDERING A TRADITIONAL HVAC CONTROL SYSTEM AND AN EQUIVALENT SMART HVAC CONTROL SYSTEM. THE COMPONENTS OF BOTH THE TRADITIONAL AND SMART CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE SPECIFIED BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE LAYOUT OF THE SERVICED SPACES IN THE REFERENCE BUILDING. THE EMBODIED ENERGY AND GHG EMISSIONS OF BOTH THE TRADITIONAL AND SMART CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE QUANTIFIED THROUGH A HYBRID LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) APPROACH. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONTROL SYSTEMS ON THE BUILDING HVAC OPERATIONAL ENERGY, A BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION IS PERFORMED BY APPLYING THE CONTROL LOGICS OF BOTH SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ENERGY AND GHG EMISSIONS SAVINGS IN THE HVAC OPERATIONAL OFFSET THE ADDITIONAL ENERGY NEEDS AND GHG EMISSIONS OF DEPLOYING THE SMART HVAC CONTROL SYSTEM.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE; RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","108295","P.GOBINATH@UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.108295","EO7B9","2352-7102","DEC 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

A LITERATURE REVIEW IS PRESENTED THAT SHOWS THE CHANGING APPROACHES TO LCC BY DRAWING ON FOUR MAJOR ACADEMIC JOURNALS AND 45 PEER-REVIEWED PAPERS. THE REVIEW VERIFIES THAT THERE IS A REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN USING LCC IN TANDEM WITH OTHER LIFE-CYCLE METHODOLOGIES FOR RESEARCH ON SUSTAINABLE BUILDING. IT ALSO PRESENTS A SET OF METHODS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO MODEL AND ESTIMATE THE LIFE-CYCLE COSTS OF `CONVENTIONAL' AND `GREEN' BUILDINGS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DISTINGUISHING THEM. THROUGH THE INFORMATION GATHERED, IT PROVIDES A CENTRALIZED SOURCE OF REFERENCE FOR THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN LCC CALCULATIONS CONCERNING SOME KEY INPUT PARAMETERS. THE FINDING SHOWS AN INCREASING TREND OF PUBLICATIONS ON THE EVALUATION OF ECONOMIC OPTIONS FOR GREEN BUILDING DESIGNS AND PERFORMANCE.

IN THOSE CASES, EMBODIED ENERGY (EE) CAN EXCEED THE OPERATIONAL SHARE. SPECIFIC LITERATURE REFERS MOSTLY TO HEATING-DOMINATED RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS, WITH A CLEAR FOCUS ON EUROPEAN, ASIAN, AND NORTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES. INFORMATION ON EMBODIED IMPACTS OF BUILDINGS OTHER REGIONS IS VIRTUALLY INEXISTENT. THIS PAPER AIMS AT ESTIMATING LIFECYCLE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GASES (GHG) EMISSIONS OF SELECTED DESIGN VERSIONS OF A PHOTOVOLTAIC-POWERED LIVING LAB IN CAMPINAS, BRAZIL; AND AT FINDING THE EMBODIED-TO-OPERATIONAL IMPACT RATIOS AS WELL AS THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO THOSE OVERALL IMPACTS. HOMER ENERGY SOFTWARE SUPPORTED SIZING OF PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) ARRAYS FOR TEN ENERGY COMPENSATION SCENARIOS TO, BASED ON SIMULATED OE, DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY THRESHOLD FOR ONSITE GENERATION ADMITTED BY THE BUILDING DESIGN. WE THEN MODELLED LIFECYCLE ENERGY AND GHG EMISSIONS FOR THE NET ZERO (NZE) AND THRESHOLD ENERGY POSITIVE (E+) VERSIONS OF THE CASE STUDY DESIGN. THE CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND (CED) AND THE CML 2001 V.2.05 METHODS SUPPORTED EMBODIED ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) CALCULATIONS IN SIMAPRO 7.3. THE E+ BUILDING COMPENSATES ITS OE PLUS NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY EMBODIED IN BUILDING PRODUCTS. STEEL FRAME AND PARTITIONS WERE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO EEG IN BUILDING PRODUCTS, WHILST THE INSULATED FACADE PANELS AND PV ARRAY PERFORMED KEY ENERGY PERFORMANCE ROLES AT COMPARATIVELY LOWER EMBODIED IMPACTS. SHIFTING FROM NZE TOWARDS E+ STATUS DISCRETELY INCREASED THE EMBODIED-TO-OPERATIONAL ENERGY RATIO (EE:OE), AT SIMILAR EMBODIED-TO-OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS (EG:OG) RATIOS. PRE-USE SHARE OF LIFECYCLE CED WAS SLIGHTLY SURPASSED BY THE OPERATIONAL ONE, WHILST RESPONDING FOR 60\% OF LIFECYCLE GWP. MATERIAL REPLACEMENT OVER THE REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO OPERATIONAL IMPACTS. EOL TREATMENT HAD NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT ON LIFECYCLE IMPACTS. EE MORE THAN TRIPLED OE AND EMBODIED EMISSIONS EXCEEDED OG BY A FACTOR OF SEVEN. EEG PROMINENCE CONFIRMS THE CRUCIAL NEED FOR A HARMONIZED CALCULATION APPROACH, AS EXPERIENCED FOR OPERATIONAL STAGE ACCOUNTANCY OVER THE RECENT YEARS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE HIGH UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN USING SIMULATED OVER MEASURED OE CONSUMPTION AND IN USING FOREIGN LCI DATABASES. THE FORMER LIMITATION CAN BE SOLVED BY MONITORING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE UPON PROJECTS COMPLETION. THIS STUDY OFFERS PRACTICAL AND DETAILED REFERENCE FOR LCA PRACTITIONERS IN ALL COUNTRIES FACING THE LATTER CHALLENGE, WHICH WILL PERSIST UNTIL INTEGRATED NATIONAL LCI DATABASES FINALLY BECOME AVAILABLE.

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE USE OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND FACTOR ANALYSIS PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF THE DATA, AND INSIGHT ON INTERNAL VALIDITY, WHICH IMPROVES INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS. THE CURRENT STUDY ALSO PROVIDES A PRETEXT FOR SUBSEQUENT ANALYSES WITH INFERENTIAL STATISTICS. NINE BUILDING ENVELOPE COMBINATIONS WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO FIVE SERVICE LIFE MODELS (N = 45, 45 DATA POINTS). THREE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DATA: GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), ATMOSPHERIC ECO-TOXICITY (ECO), AND ATMOSPHERIC ACIDIFICATION (ACID) FROM THE TOOL FOR THE REDUCTION AND ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (TRACI) ASSESSMENT METHOD. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS MEASURED MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, SKEWNESS, AND KURTOSIS. FOR THE FACTOR ANALYSIS, DATA WERE DISAGGREGATED ACCORDING TO NINE VARIABLES, INCLUDING CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT (FREQUENCY), MINOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPAIRS, MINOR REPAIRS, INSPECTIONS 1 AND 2, AND TOTAL TRANSPORTATION (N = 45, 405 DATA POINTS). ALL STATISTICAL OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS SOFTWARE. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS SHOW A RELATIVELY NORMAL DATA DISTRIBUTION FOR GWP. DATA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR ECO AND ACID DEVIATED SLIGHTLY FROM NORMAL, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH SHAPIRO-WILK AND KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TESTS. FACTOR ANALYSIS RESULTED IN THREE FACTORS FOR GWP AND ECO, AND TWO FACTORS FOR ACID. IN EACH ANALYSIS, CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT, AND MAJOR REPLACEMENT (FREQUENCY) ALIGNED AS VARIABLES IN A COMMON FACTOR. THIS ALIGNMENT CORROBORATES PREVIOUS FINDINGS. OTHER VARIABLES IN THE FACTOR ANALYSIS WERE LESS CLEARLY OR INCONSISTENTLY ALIGNED. THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF DATA IN THE STUDY. THE DATA ARE DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS USING INFERENTIAL UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL TESTS, A TOPIC THAT IS EXAMINED IN PART 2 OF THIS STUDY AS REPORTED BY GRANT ET AL. (INT J LIFE CYCLE ASSESS, 2015). THE FACTOR ANALYSIS USED IN THE STUDY CORROBORATES THE CONCLUSIONS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES AND PROVIDES A BASIS FOR FUTURE STATISTICAL ANALYSES.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA; UNIVERSITY OF WEST FLORIDA; STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA; UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA; STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA; UNIVERSITY OF WEST FLORIDA",NA,"AGRANT1@UWF.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-016-1099-4","DM0LO","1614-7502",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0948-3349","INT.

HOWEVER, EXISTING BUILDINGS INTENDED TO BE DEMOLISHED COULD BE CONSIDERED AS MATERIAL BANKS FOR FUTURE CONSTRUCTIONS, WITH THE AIM TO EXPLOIT ANTHROPOGENIC RESOURCES, EXTEND MATERIAL/PRODUCT EFFICIENCY, AND REDUCE THE EXTRACTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS CONCEPT OF BUILDINGS AS MATERIAL BANKS IS BEING STUDIED MORE AND MORE IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BUT IT STILL REQUIRES THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK TO BE FULLY DIGITALIZED, THUS MAKING MATERIALS REUSABLE IN NEW BUILDINGS STARTING FROM THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STAGE. MOREOVER, THE DECISION PROCESS REGARDING CE STRATEGIES REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE DECONSTRUCTION AND END-OF-LIFE PROCESSES, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IN CE IMPLEMENTATION.

DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS OF A BUILDING AT THE EARLY STAGE OF DESIGN. IN THIS STUDY, A WHOLE-LIFE CARBON EMISSION ESTIMATION MODEL FOR THE EARLY STAGE OF BUILDING DESIGN IS DEVELOPED BASED ON COMPARISON OF THE STANDARD CALCULATIONS AND AN ANALYSIS OF STOCK CASES. FIRSTLY, THE STANDARD CALCULATION METHODS IN CHINA, JAPAN AND EUROPE WERE COMPARED, AND THE BOUNDARY OF THE MODEL WAS DEFINED IN THREE PARTS: PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION AND OPERATION. SECOND, INFORMATION ON 68 EXAMPLES OF CHINESE BUILDINGS WAS COLLECTED AND DIVIDED INTO A TRAINING SET AND A TEST SET AT A RATIO OF 7:3. IN THE TRAINING SET, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CARBON EMISSIONS AND THE DESIGN PARAMETERS WAS SEARCHED, AND A CARBON EMISSION ESTIMATION MODEL APPLICABLE TO DIFFERENT STAGES WAS CONSTRUCTED. FINALLY, THE MODEL WAS APPLIED TO THE TEST SET FOR VALIDATION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CALCULATION ERROR OF THE MODEL IS WITHIN +/- 15\%, AND IT CAN QUICKLY ESTIMATE CARBON EMISSIONS BASED ON THE DESIGN FACTORS, WHICH IS HELPFUL FOR CARBON EMISSION ASSESSMENT WORK IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","TAIYUAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY","744","GUOCHENG1107@163.COM HAOZHOU2020@TSINGHUA.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su16020744","GF9E0","2071-1050",NA,NA,"RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION OF LOW CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DESIGN METHODS AND KEY TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOSPITALS AND BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY BUILDINGS","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE EDITOR AND THE ANONYMOUS REFEREES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS, WHICH WERE MOST USEFUL IN REVISING THE PAPER.

DURING THE LIFECYCLE OF ONE BUILDING, MULTIPLE ASSESSMENT METHODS ARE EMPLOYED SEMI-CONCURRENTLY AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION OVERLAP BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE PHASES. THIS INFORMATION IS SEMANTICALLY RICH AND CONTEXT-DEPENDENT, REFLECTING THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE THAT IT EXISTS WITHIN.

THE MODEL PROVIDES FLEXIBLE, MODULAR, AND EXTENSIBLE DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS FOR THE REPRESENTATION, TRANSFORMATION, INTEGRATION, AND VISUALIZATION OF PERFORMANCE INFORMATION.

AS A RESULT, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS MIGHT NOT BE WELL-CONSIDERED. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT SYSTEM DYNAMICS (SD) MODELLING APPROACH CAN OVERCOME SUCH LIMITATION, CONTRIBUTING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF CLCA. FIRST, A NOVEL CLCA CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS PRESENTED COMBINING CONSEQUENTIAL LIFE CYCLE INVENTORIES, SD PRINCIPLES AND THE USE OF SPATIALLY EXPLICIT DATA. SECOND, ITS INNOVATIVE VALUE IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SD-CLCA MODEL. THIS MODEL EVALUATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY-DEMAND IN THE MARKET DUE TO AN INCREASING ADOPTION OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS (SPV) IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. IT ALLOWS TRACEABILITY OF BOTH SYSTEM CHANGES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES, THE SD-CLCA MODEL IS APPLIED TO LISBON MUNICIPALITY AND THE BROADER ELECTRICITY MARKET OF PORTUGAL. RESULTS SHOWCASE HOW SD-CLCA MODELS COULD PROVIDE A CLOSER REPRESENTATION OF THE REAL EFFECTS OF PREDICTED CHANGES IN THE ELECTRICITY MARKET DUE TO DIFFERENT SPV ADOPTION SCENARIOS. THEY ALSO ILLUSTRATE THAT CHANGES IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, POPULATION AND PRECIPITATION PROVIDE A DIVERSIFIED SET OF IMPACT SCORES. AS A METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, AND TO THE NET OF A FEW SHORTCOMINGS, THE PROPOSED SD-CLCA MODEL IS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITY OF CAUSE-EFFECT DYNAMICS DETERMINING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, WHICH CURRENTLY REPRESENTS A RESEARCH GAP IN LCA.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL; LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITE DE BORDEAUX; UNIVERSITY OF TRENTO; UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA; UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA","130127","BENEDETTO.RUGANI@LIST.LU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130127","0A0HK","1879-1786",NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND (FNR) OF LUXEMBOURG; EUROPEAN COMMISSION [730468]; CAPES (BRAZILIAN FEDERAL AGENCY FOR SUPPORT AND EVALUATION OF GRADUATE EDUCATION-BRAZIL); [ESTIMUM''-C16/SR/11311935]; [C16/SR/11311935]","THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND (FNR) OF LUXEMBOURG (CORE PROJECT ``ESTIMUM''-C16/SR/11311935; WWW.LIST.

WATER HEATING SYSTEM CONTRIBUTE TO A BUILDING'S ENERGETIC CONSUMPTION, MAINLY IN RESIDENTIAL UNITS, THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING'S OPERATIONAL PHASE. VARIABILITY IN ENERGY SOURCES, RESERVATION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS OF HOT WATER ALONG WITH THE TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS USED IN THESE BUILDING SYSTEMS ARE KEY DECISIONS TO MAKE IN THE INITIAL DESIGN PHASES OF A BUILDING PROJECT. OFTEN, THE DEFINITION OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE WATER HEATING SYSTEM FOR A BUILDING IS MADE VIA A TECHNICAL-ECONOMIC DECISION. HOWEVER, THE DECISION IS RARELY BASED ON NATURAL RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT GENERATION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE-CYCLE OF THE HEATING SYSTEMS AND OF BUILDINGS AS A WHOLE. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN APPLICATION OF A SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TOOL, BASED ON AN INTEGRATED BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AND LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS (LCA) METHOD FOR SELECTION OF HOT WATER SYSTEMS, DURING THE EARLY DESIGN BUILDING PHASE. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE PRE-OPERATIONAL PHASE, IN ORDER TO ENABLE DECISION MAKERS TO APPRECIATE THE RESULTING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF WATER HEATING SYSTEMS IN BUILDINGS. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE FRAMEWORK IS TESTED VIA A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SOLAR HEATING WATER SYSTEMS AND NATURAL GAS HEATING WATER SYSTEMS FOR A RESIDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY BUILDING TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL. FOR THE INDICATORS DAMAGE TO HUMAN HEALTH AND DAMAGE TO ECOSYSTEM, RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE GREATEST IMPACT ON GLOBAL WARMING COMES FROM THE NATURAL GAS HEATING SYSTEM, WHILE FOR SOLAR HEATING, FREE PARTICULATE MATTER WAS THE HIGHEST NEGATIVE CONTRIBUTION. THE OPERATION PHASE FOR THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM WAS HIGHEST FOR CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE FOR SOLAR HEATING SYSTEM, IT WAS THE FRESH WATER THAT WAS IMPACTED THE MOST DURING THE PRE-OPERATIONAL PHASE OF THE SYSTEM'S USE.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO DE JANEIRO; UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY; UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO DE JANEIRO; WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY",NA,"VIVIANWYTAM@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15623599.2022.2068179","O2TL6","2331-2327","APR 2022",NA,"CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT); FAPERJ (FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO)","THE AUTHORS WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT) AND FAPERJ (FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO).",NA,"1562-3599","INT.

THE APPROPRIATE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TECHNOLOGIES BRINGS SEVERAL BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF PROJECT EFFICIENCY EMERGE IN THE FORM OF NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE WASTE IN THE PROCESSES. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A PRACTICAL PROCESS MODEL TO PLAN THE INFORMATION FLOW FOR BIM-BASED PROJECTS. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROPOSE A MODEL TO PLAN THE FLOW OF PROJECT INFORMATION AMONG PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR MAIN FINDINGS ARE FIRSTLY, THE FOUNDATION FOR DATA MANAGEMENT STARTS FROM DEFINING UNIFIED ONE DATA FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FOR THE PROCESS. UNIFIED DATA MEANS ONE SINGLE REPOSITORY OF DATA - ALL STAKEHOLDERS USE THE SAME UNIFIED DATA. IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT DATA RESPONSIBILITIES AND OWNERSHIP ARE DEFINED. SECONDLY, WE FOUND THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE THAT THE DATA NEEDS ARE NOT PLANNED BEFOREHAND, RESISTANCE TO CHANGE, DIFFICULTY RECEIVING EXISTING DATA AND DATA MUST BE MODIFIED BEFORE USE. AS A WHOLE, IT SEEMS SOMETIMES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ON DATA TRANSFER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT WHAT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED AND WHY. FINALLY OUR CONSTRUCTION, THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL FOR DATA FLOW ORIGINATES FROM ONE DATA TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS, SINGLE DATA REPOSITORY MUST BE UPDATED ALONG THE LIFECYCLE OF THE OBJECT COVERING ALSO THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE, WHERE THE DATA HAS TO BE UPDATED THROUGH THE WHOLE LIFE-CYCLE. THIS NEW APPROACH IS INTENDED TO ENABLE THE EARLY INVOLVEMENT OF MAINTENANCE STAKEHOLDERS IN DESIGNING PRODUCT DATA FOR A PROJECT LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THE MODEL HELPS TO CHANGE THE CURRENT INFORMATION FLOW AND GAIN THE BENEFITS THAT A BIM-BASED PROCESS CAN OFFER. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON CASE STUDIES AND IS QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND NATURALLY NEEDS MORE VALIDATION.","KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF OULU",NA,"HEIKKI.HALTTULA@TOPCON.COM HARRI.HAAPASALO@OULU.FI RISTO.SILVOLA@KONECRANES.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.36680/j.itcon.2020.012","KV1EP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1874-4753","J.

TO THIS END, FACILITATING SUSTAINABILITY-ORIENTED DECISION-MAKING FOR DWM PLANNING REQUIRES A SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING MULTIFACETED CRITERIA. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM)-BASED DWM SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO FACILITATE THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND DECISION-MAKING BY COUPLING THE ENRICHED INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES MODEL WITH HYBRID MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-AIDING (MCDA) METHODS USING DYNAMO VISUAL SCRIPTING. TO STREAMLINE THE DATA-INTENSIVE LCA PROCESS, THIS STUDY ENRICHED THE BIM PROPERTIES AND ACCOMMODATED THEM INTO THE LCA DATA TEMPLATE TO ENHANCE DATA INTEROPERABILITY, THUS ACHIEVING SEAMLESS DATA TRANSFER. MOREOVER, HYBRID MCDA METHODS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE DECISION-MAKING WORKFLOW FOR DWM SCENARIO RANKING. A PILOT STUDY IS EMPLOYED TO VERIFY THE APPLICABILITY OF THE DECISION-AIDING FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS UNVEIL THAT THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE ASCENDED WITH THE RECYCLING RATE. THE OPTIMAL DWM ALTERNATIVE WITH THE HIGHEST RECYCLING RATE YIELDS THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY SCORE AT 91.63. CONVERSELY, A DWM ALTERNATIVE REFLECTING THE `STATUS QUO' IN CHINA'S RECYCLING INDUSTRY HAS THE LOWEST SCORE AT 8.37, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE BASELINE SCENARIO WITH A 50\% RECYCLING RATE. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE `GROWTH CURVE' OF THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE CONTINUOUSLY FLATTENS AS THE TARGET RECYCLING RATE ESCALATES. THE INCREMENT IN RECYCLING RATE FROM THE `AUSTRALIAN STANDARD' SCENARIO TO THE OPTIMAL SCENARIO IS 18.4\%, WHEREAS THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE MERELY INCREASES BY 2.3\%, SIGNALLING THAT THE FORMER SCENARIO ARRIVED AT AN OPTIMUM POINT FOR MAXIMISING THE COST-EFFICIENCY OF DWM UNDER THE PREDEFINED FRAMEWORK AND CONTEXTS.","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE; UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY",NA,"DONGCHENH@STUDENT.UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1177/0734242X241291941","L4J4L","1096-3669","NOV 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0734-242X","WASTE MANAGE.

TO THIS END, FACILITATING SUSTAINABILITY-ORIENTED DECISION-MAKING FOR DWM PLANNING REQUIRES A SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING THE TRADE-OFFS AMONG MULTIFACETED CRITERIA. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A BIM-BASED DWM SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO FACILITATE THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA) AND DECISION-MAKING BY INTEGRATING LCSA-RELATED PROPERTIES AND HYBRID MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-AIDING (MCDA) METHODS INTO A BIM ENVIRONMENT USING DYNAMO VISUAL SCRIPTING. A DYNAMIC LINKAGE IS DEVELOPED IN THE STREAMLINED BIM-BASED LCSA PROCESS, WHERE THE ENRICHED INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASS (IFC) MODELS ARE COUPLED WITH CUSTOM LCSA DATA TEMPLATES TO ACHIEVE SEAMLESS DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BIM PLATFORM AND EXTERNAL LCA TOOLS. SUBSEQUENTLY, HYBRID MCDA METHODS CONVERT THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS INTO DWM SCENARIO RANKING. A PILOT STUDY VERIFIES THE APPLICABILITY OF THE BIM-BASED FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS UNVEIL THAT THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE ASCENDED WITH THE RECYCLING RATE. THE OPTIMAL DWM ALTERNATIVE WITH THE HIGHEST RECYCLING RATE YIELDS THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY SCORE AT 91.63. CONVERSELY, A DWM ALTERNATIVE REFLECTING THE `STATUS QUO' IN CHINA'S RECYCLING INDUSTRY HAS THE LOWEST SCORE AT 8.37, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE BASELINE SCENARIO WITH A 50\% RECYCLING RATE. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE `GROWTH CURVE' OF THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE CONTINUOUSLY FLATTENS AS THE TARGET RECYCLING RATE ESCALATES. THE INCREMENT IN RECYCLING RATE FROM THE ``AUSTRALIAN STANDARD'' SCENARIO TO THE OPTIMAL SCENARIO IS 18.4\%, WHEREAS THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE MERELY INCREASES BY 2.3\%, IMPLYING THAT THE FORMER SCENARIO ARRIVED AT AN OPTIMUM POINT FOR MAXIMISING THE COST-EFFICIENCY OF DWM UNDER THE PREDEFINED SETTINGS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","70","HARRISON.HAN@UNIMELB.EDU.AU ABBAS.R@UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/recycling9040070","F0Z5G","2313-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RECYCLING-BASEL","RECYCLING","ENGLISH","AUG",NA,"87","4","GOLD","HAN, DONGCHEN/0000-0002-0030-0201 RAJABIFARD, ABBAS/0000-0002-4256-3173",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS","HAN, DONGCHEN/IWM-3538-2023 RAJABIFARD, ABBAS/D-1818-2015",NA,1,"IMPROVING THE DECISION-MAKING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEMOLITION WASTE MANAGEMENT BY COMBINING A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING-BASED LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK AND HYBRID MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-AIDING APPROACH","ARTICLE","WOS001307187200001","1","1","9","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","EMERGING SOURCES CITATION INDEX (ESCI)",2024,"HAN DONGCHEN;RAJABIFARD ABBAS","RAJABIFARD, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MELBOURNE, CTR SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCT \& LAND ADM, DEPT INFRASTRUCT ENGN, PARKVILLE, VIC 3010, AUSTRALIA","ISI","RECYCLING-BASEL","UNIV MELBOURNE;UNIV MELBOURNE","UNIV MELBOURNE",NA,"HAN D, 2024, RECYCLING-BASEL","HAN D, 2024, RECYCLING-BASEL",NA

LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS (LCCA), WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT IN SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT, IS A PRINCIPAL TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY FOR THE TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE BUDGET OF A BUILDING PROJECT. LCCA IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS DUE TO REPETITIVE COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS, WHICH ARE BASED ON VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE. FOR CONVENTIONAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, DATA ARE USUALLY STORED IN THE FORM OF PAPERS AND ARE INPUT INTO THE SYSTEMS MANUALLY. THIS RESULTS IN DATA LOSS AND INCONSISTENT DATA, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CONTRIBUTE TO INACCURATE LIFE-CYCLE COSTS (LCCS). BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) IS A MODERN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY OVERCOME THE ASPERITIES OF THE CONVENTIONAL BUILDING LCCA. HOWEVER, EXISTING BIM TOOLS CANNOT CARRY OUT BUILDING LCCA DUE TO THEIR LIMITED CAPABILITIES. THE RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH BIM FOR ORGANIZING, STORING, AND EXCHANGING LCCA DATA IN A LOGICAL AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER. IN THIS PAPER, A BIM-INTEGRATED RDBMS IS DEVELOPED FOR COMPILING AND ORGANIZING THE REQUIRED DATA AND INFORMATION FROM BIM MODELS TO COMPUTE BUILDING LCCS. THE SYSTEM INTEGRATES THE BIM AUTHORING PROGRAM, THE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, THE SPREADSHEET SYSTEM, AND THE VISUAL PROGRAMMING INTERFACE. IT IS PART OF THE BIM-DATABASE-INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR BUILDING LCCA USING A MULTI-PARAMETRIC MODEL. IT REPRESENTS A NEW AUTOMATED METHODOLOGY FOR PERFORMING BUILDING LCCA, WHICH CAN FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT IN BUILDING PROJECTS.","254 PHAYATHAI RD, PATHUMWAN, BANGKOK, 10330, THAILAND","CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY; OSAKA UNIVERSITY",NA,"HANG.THTHLE@GMAIL.COM VEERASAK.L@CHULA.AC.TH",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.4186/ej.2020.24.2.75","LO5GP",NA,NA,NA,"ASEAN UNIVERSITY NETWORK/SOUTHEAST ASIA ENGINEERING EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT NETWORK (AUN/SEED-NET); DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, FACULTY OF ENGINEERING, CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY","THE AUTHORS ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASEAN UNIVERSITY NETWORK/SOUTHEAST ASIA ENGINEERING EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT NETWORK (AUN/SEED-NET) AND DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, FACULTY OF ENGINEERING, CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT.",NA,"0125-8281","ENG.

DUE TO THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FROM FOSSIL FUEL, PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO USE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ENERGY TO THE BUILDINGS. INTEGRATED SOLAR ABSORPTION COOLING AND HEATING (SACH) TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ONE OF THE PROMISING SOLUTIONS TO THIS ISSUE. DUE TO THE NATURE OF SOLAR ENERGY, INTEGRATED SACH HAS MANY DRAWBACKS, SUCH AS DISCONTINUITY OF GENERATION, THUS BACKUP SYSTEM DRIVEN BY FOSSIL FUEL SHOULD BE INCLUDED TO THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AS WELL. THEREFORE, OPTIMIZATION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED DURING THE DESIGN STAGE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A METHOD TO OPTIMIZE AN INTEGRATED SACH SYSTEM. REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LIFE CYCLE PRIMARY ENERGY SAVINGS (PES) AND THE SYSTEM FACTORS ACCORDING TO THE DATA PROVIDED BY EXPERIMENTS. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ACCURATE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE PROBLEM USING SMALL NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS, THE METHOD OF CENTRAL COMPOSITE DESIGN (CCD) FROM DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DE) IS USED AS A KEY TECHNIQUE. THE EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED IN TRANSIENT SYSTEMS SIMULATION (TRNSYS).

IT HAS ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A KEY STRATEGY TO REDUCE CONSTRUCTION-INDUCED CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH TO EXAMINE CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION IN PREFABRICATION BY USING THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS, E.G., BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM), EMERGING FROM THE TECHNOLOGY SPHERE. AS A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF A FACILITY, BIM PROVIDES A CYBER PLATFORM BASED ON WHICH MANY ASSESSMENT AND SIMULATION WORKS CAN BE PERFORMED WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSTRUCT THE PHYSICAL FACILITY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A BIM-BASED APPROACH TO MEASURING CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DURING THE MATERIALIZATION STAGE OF A PREFABRICATED BUILDING PROJECT. FINDINGS FROM THE STUDY INDICATE THAT BIM IS AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS AND THAT PREFABRICATION REDUCES CARBON EMISSIONS WHEN COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHODS. THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO THE REDUCTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS THROUGH PREFABRICATION. THIS IS PERTINENT TO CONTRACTORS, HOMEBUYERS AND GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING WAYS TO ACHIEVE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER B.V.

LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ASSESSMENT (LCEA) IS USED TO EVALUATE THIS ENERGY DEMAND ALREADY IN EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN. HOWEVER, AT THAT POINT, THE BUILDING DESIGN AND THE RELATED INFORMATION CAN QUICKLY CHANGE AND ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIALLY LARGE UNCERTAINTY. THIS UNCERTAINTY IN BUILDING INFORMATION INFLUENCES THE LCEA AND THEREFORE DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE DESIGNER. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT DESIGN VARIANTS TO DECIDE FOR THE BEST OPTION. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A METHOD TO PERFORM LCEA AND TO ASSESS AND CONSEQUENTLY STRATEGICALLY REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN BUILDINGS' INFORMATION ON THE LCEA IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IS USED TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF UNCERTAINTY ON LCEA AND TO PRIORITIZE DECISIONS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY. THE METHOD IS EMBEDDED IN A MULTI-LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (LOD) MODELLING APPROACH COVERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUILDING DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN. THE METHOD IS APPLIED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT BUILDING SHAPES AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE METHOD RENDERS VALID RESULTS TO ASSESS THE PROJECT-SPECIFIC UNCERTAINTY IN LCEA RESULTS.

WITHIN THE STATUS QUO AND THE REFURBISHMENT SCENARIOS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT ENERGY SYSTEMS AND ENERGY STANDARDS OF THE BUILDING ENVELOPE ARE INVESTIGATED. CITYGML SEMANTIC 3D CITY MODELS SERVE AS A SOURCE OF BUILDING-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR THESE ASSESSMENTS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EVEN IF ALL RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ARE REFURBISHED TO PASSIVE HOUSE STANDARD AND POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGIES BY 2035, LIFE CYCLE-BASED ENERGY DEMANDS AND EMISSIONS WILL STILL BE PRESENT, THAT COUNTERACT THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. IN ADDITION, THE LIFE CYCLE-BASED COSTS EXCEED THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY THE REFURBISHMENT. THE DEVELOPED METHOD IS IMPLEMENTED IN JAVA WHICH PROVIDES ON THE ONE HAND A NEW APPROACH TO ASSESSING BUILDING STOCKS ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS AND ON THE OTHER HAND ITS TRANSFERABILITY.

FOR THE ANALYSIS, WE USE OUR DEVELOPED TOOL URBI+, WHICH TAKES 3D CITY MODELS IN THE CITYGML STANDARD ENRICHED WITH BUILDING SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS INPUT PARAMETERS. THUS, WE INVESTIGATE BOTH THE STATUS QUO OF MUNICHS' BUILDING STOCK AND TWO DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS WITH THE GOAL OF CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY THE YEAR 2035. DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO 1 FOCUSES ON THE USE OF HEAT PUMPS AND SCENARIO 2 ON THE EXPANSION OF THE DISTRICT HEATING NETWORK. THE YEAR 2035 HAS BEEN DEFINED BY THE CITY OF MUNICH AS THE OFFICIAL GOAL FOR ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ASSESSMENT, WE ADDRESS THE PARAMETERS OF ENERGY DEMAND, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND COSTS. THE RESULTS SHOW A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT SPACE BETWEEN THESE PARAMETERS AND HOW AMBITIOUS IT IS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2035.

THE NUMBER OF STUDIES AND ATTEMPTS OF INTEGRATION AT THE BUILDING DESIGN STAGE IS INCREASING. THIS STUDY IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR A NATIONAL LCA TOOL THAT CONSIDERS EGYPTIAN CONSTRAINTS AND STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS TO SERVE AS A DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR EARLY DESIGN. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY FIRST REVIEWING AND ANALYZING LCA INTEGRATION METHODS DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES, EMPHASIZING PARAMETRIC METHODS. SECOND, STUDYING THE SITUATION OF LCA AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN EGYPT THROUGH PUBLICATIONS, BUILDING CODES, AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THESE STEPS, A SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION METHOD BASED ON THE GENERATIVE DESIGN WAS DEVELOPED AS A TOOL FRAMEWORK THAT MAINLY FOCUSES ON RESIDENTIAL BUILDING EXTERIOR WALLS AS THE FIRST STEP OF THE NATIONAL LCA TOOL TO AID THE DESIGN PROCESS AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION TO BEING THE FIRST INITIATIVE FOR A NATIONAL LCA TOOL, THE NOVELTY OF THIS WORK IS THE METHOD OF INTEGRATION COMPARED TO OTHER PARAMETRIC LCA, WHICH AIMS AT OPTIMIZING BOTH EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THE EGYPTIAN CONDITIONS WHILE OFFERING MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS.

ITS OBJECTIVE IS THREEFOLD: FIRST, TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS THE IMPACT OF TWO KEY PLM BUILDING BLOCKS ON NEW PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. SECOND, TO USE THE AFOREMENTIONED PLM BUILDING BLOCKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF PLM AND CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEMS. THIRD, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM PROVIDES MORE NEW PRODUCT BENEFITS THAN THE PLM SYSTEM AND THAT THE USAGE OF THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 87 MANUFACTURERS IN THE TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN ONE CANADIAN PROVINCE. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ONLY TEN MANUFACTURERS HAVE ADOPTED A CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM. AS EXPECTED, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TWO KEY PLM BUILDING BLOCKS, NAMELY OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (IS) USAGE, ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THE LEVEL OF FORWARD OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION IS SIMILAR IN THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM AND IN THE PLM SYSTEM, WHILE THE LEVEL OF BACKWARD OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION, THE USAGE OF THE PLM SYSTEM AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE HIGHER IN THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM. FINALLY, THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE USAGE OF THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS CONTRIBUTION SHOULD GIVE ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE AND BENEFITS OF PLM AND ITS SUPPORTING SYSTEMS (THE PLM SYSTEM AND THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM).","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",NA,NA,"HADAYA.PIERRE@UQAM.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/02635571211225486","960DY","1758-5783",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0263-5577","IND.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF APPLYING A SOL-GEL COATING ON HEMP SHIV, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DURABILITY OF THIS INNOVATIVE BIO-BASED MATERIAL, USING A REGIONALISED LCA MODEL, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL SPECIFIC PECULIARITIES. THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF USING BIO-BASED MATERIALS IN THE BUILDING ENVELOPE COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL SYNTHETIC CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, AND COMPARED THE IMPACT OF A REGIONALISED APPROACH WITH A GLOBAL APPROACH. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF TREATED HEMP SHIV IN A WALL WITH A U-VALUE OF 0.15 W/M(2).K WAS COMPARED TO UNTREATED HEMPCRETE AND A REFERENCE CAVITY WALL WITH THE SAME U-VALUE. CONSIDERING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE PRODUCTION OF HEMP SHIV, NITROGEN FERTILISER WAS THE HOTSPOT. THE LCA RESULTS SHOWED THAT, USING INNOVATIVE BIO-BASED MATERIALS IN CONSTRUCTION, TREATED HEMP SHIV WITH SOL-GEL CAN DECREASE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF A BUILDING ENVELOPE THROUGH CARBON SEQUESTRATION. USING THE MORE ACCURATE SITE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS WILL RESULT IN MORE CONSISTENT AND SITE-APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESULTS FOR DECISION-MAKING.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF SHERBROOKE; LAVAL UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF BATH","2987","BEN.AMOR@USHERBROOKE.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/ma12182987","JC2SK","1996-1944",NA,NA,"QUEBEC MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION THROUGH ITS PSR-SIIRI PROGRAMS (PD PSR2); FONDS DE RECHERCHE DU QUEBEC-NATURE ET TECHNOLOGIES (FRQNET); EUROPEAN UNION [636835]; H2020 SOCIETAL CHALLENGES PROGRAMME [636835] FUNDING SOURCE: H2020 SOCIETAL CHALLENGES PROGRAMME","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO THE QUEBEC MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH ITS PSR-SIIRI PROGRAMS (PD PSR2) AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS OF THE NSERC INDUSTRIAL CHAIR ON ECO-RESPONSIBLE WOOD CONSTRUCTION (CIRCERB).

TO GUIDE THE CRITICAL EARLY-DESIGN STAGES OF A COMPLICATED PRODUCT LIKE A BUILDING, IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO RAPIDLY ESTIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WITH LIMITED INFORMATION, QUANTIFY THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY, AND IDENTIFY CRITICAL PARAMETERS WHERE MORE DETAIL IS NEEDED.METHODSTHE AUTHORS HAVE DEVELOPED THE BUILDING ATTRIBUTE TO IMPACT ALGORITHM (BAIA) TO DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF STREAMLINED (NOT SCOPE-LIMITING), PROBABILISTIC LCA FOR GUIDING THE DESIGN OF A BUILDING FROM EARLY STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS WHEN MANY ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN ARE UNKNOWN OR UNDECIDED. EARLY-DESIGN UNCERTAINTY IS ACCOMMODATED THROUGH UNDER-SPECIFICATIONCHARACTERIZING THE DESIGN USING THE AVAILABLE LEVEL OF DETAILAND CAPTURING THE RESULTING VARIABILITY IN PREDICTED IMPACTS THROUGH MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS. PROBABILISTIC TRIAGE WITH SENSITIVITY ANALYSES IDENTIFIES WHICH UNCERTAIN ATTRIBUTES SHOULD BE SPECIFIED FURTHER TO INCREASE THE PRECISION OF THE RESULTS.

AS INFORMATION IS SEQUENTIALLY ADDED TO EACH VARIANT, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE BETWEEN EACH VARIANT PAIR IS CALCULATED TO DETERMINE WHEN ENOUGH INFORMATION HAS BEEN ADDED TO RESOLVE THE DESIGNS (IDENTIFY WHICH DESIGN IS PREFERABLE) WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE. AT THE SIXTH STEP IN THE ANALYSIS, ALL VARIANT PAIRS WHOSE MEAN IMPACTS DIFFER BY AT LEAST 4\% ARE RESOLVABLE WITH 90\% CONFIDENCE, EVEN THOUGH ONLY SIX ATTRIBUTES ARE SPECIFIED AND DOZENS OF ATTRIBUTES REMAIN UNDER-SPECIFIED. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPARATIVE RESULTS FOR EACH VARIANT PAIR ARE VALIDATED AGAINST A SET OF CONVENTIONAL LCA RESULTS, SHOWING THAT BAIA IDENTIFIES THE CORRECT PREFERABLE DESIGN AMONG EACH RESOLVABLE PAIR AT THIS STEP.CONCLUSIONSITERATIVE SPECIFICATION GUIDED BY PROBABILISTIC TRIAGE CAN HELP IDENTIFY PROMISING EARLY-DESIGN ALTERNATIVES EVEN WHEN DETAILS ARE ONLY PROVIDED FOR KEY ATTRIBUTES. THE ANALYSIS OF HYPOTHETICAL DESIGN VARIANTS DEMONSTRATES THAT BAIA IS BOTH EFFICIENT (ARRIVES AT STATISTICALLY DEFENSIBLE CONCLUSIONS FROM DESIGN VARIANT COMPARISONS BASED ON FEW PIECES OF INFORMATION) AND EFFECTIVE (IDENTIFIES THE SAME PREFERABLE DESIGN VARIANTS AS CONVENTIONAL LCAS).","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT)",NA,"JCHESTER@MIT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-017-1431-7","GT5WK","1614-7502",NA,NA,"CONCRETE SUSTAINABILITY HUB AT MIT; PORTLAND CEMENT ASSOCIATION; READY MIXED CONCRETE RESEARCH \& EDUCATION FOUNDATION","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CONCRETE SUSTAINABILITY HUB AT MIT, WITH SPONSORSHIP PROVIDED BY THE PORTLAND CEMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE READY MIXED CONCRETE RESEARCH \& EDUCATION FOUNDATION.

THE CONCEPT IS PRESENTED AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION, PROOF OF CONCEPT AND TO UNDERPIN THE VALUE OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CONCEPT LEADING TO AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO LIFE-CYCLE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER PRESENTS A CONCEPT FOR A WAY OF WORKING. A PROOF OF CONCEPT IS PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF A CASE STUDY IN WHICH THIS CONCEPT IS OPERATIONAL. IT SHOWS THAT THIS WAY OF WORKING USING OPEN-STANDARD BIM CAN BE APPLIED TO MANAGE INFORMATION IN THE LIFE-CYCLE. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE, NOR SUGGEST TO PROVIDE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR SPECIFIC BENEFITS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY. FINDINGS - THE PAPER SHOWS THAT OPEN-STANDARD BIM CAN BE APPLIED FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN THE LIFE-CYCLE OF (CONSTRUCTION) ASSETS. THE SPECIFIC APPROACH THAT IS APPLIED IN PRACTICE IN A DUTCH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IS EXPLAINED INCLUDING A CASE PROJECT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE EXAMPLE OF TRAVERSE DIEREN ATTESTS TO A IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPROACH IN PRACTICE. FROM THIS CASE IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE SUGGESTED APPROACH IS FEASIBLE IN THE INITIATION AND DESIGN PHASE AND APPLICABLE DURING REALIZATION. BASED ON THE EXAMPLE AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER IT CANNOT BE CONCLUDED TO WHAT EXTENT THE KNOWN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN THE LIFE-CYCLE ARE SOLVED. THEREFORE A DETAILED EVALUATION ON THE INFORMATION EXCHANGE WOULD BE REQUIRED WHICH IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS PAPER. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW DIFFERENT (THEORETICAL) CONCEPTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMBINED AND IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE TO ATTAIN THE DEFINED BIM GOALS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER SHOWS A PRACTICAL CASE IMPLEMENTATION OF OPEN-STANDARD BIM (USING COINS).

THE EVOLUTION OF BIM AS DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS STUDIED IN A NETWORK OF COMPANIES DEVELOPING AND USING BIM TOOLS FOR NEW WAYS OF WORKING IN THE FINNISH HVAC INDUSTRY. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IS A DEDUCTIVE CASE STUDY TESTING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DERIVED FROM THE LITERATURE. THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT BIM HAS EMERGED AS DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, WHILE DEVELOPMENT HAS STALLED IN USE AND OPERATIONS. THE EXPLANATION FOR THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION IS FOUND IN THE EVIDENCE OF THREE SOCIOTECHNICAL ACTIONS OF ADOPTION, REUSE, AND RECOMBINATION ACTIVATING SELF-REINFORCING POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. THE STALLED DEVELOPMENT IN USE AND OPERATIONS IS EXPLAINED BY A LACK OF ADOPTION AND REUSE, WHICH IN TURN INHIBITS THE TOOL AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED FOR INCREASING ADOPTION. SERVITIZATION BY EXTENDING PROJECT DURATION AND ALIGNING THE BUSINESS OF ACTORS TO LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE, STANDARDIZATION OF INTERFACES AND PROCESSES, AND OPEN ARCHITECTURES ARE IDENTIFIED AS ACTIONS TO ACTIVATE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE EVOLUTION FOR THE LATER LIFE CYCLE STAGES OF A BUILDING. THE ORIGINALITY AND VALUE OF THE PAPER IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF SOCIOTECHNICAL ACTION EXPLAINS THE EMERGENCE OF BIM AS DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW FINDINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO ENABLE MORE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY USE OF PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS AND THE CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON THE TOTAL EMBODIED ENERGY USE FOR A NUMBER OF REAL BUILDING PROJECTS. RESULT SHOWED THAT THE LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY USE OF PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS RANGED FROM 7.33 GJ/M(3) FOR PRECAST STAIRCASE TO 13.34 GJ/M(3) FOR PRECAST FORM. THE RECYCLING PROCESS COULD ACHIEVE 16\%-24\% ENERGY REDUCTION. THIS STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT APART FROM REUSABILITY, ENERGY SAVINGS ARE ALSO OBTAINED FROM WASTE REDUCTION AND HIGH QUALITY CONTROL, SAVING 4\%-14\% OF THE TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. ALL THESE ADVANTAGES CAN BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY STRATEGIES PROVIDED BY PRECAST CONSTRUCTION. THE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE AVERAGE INCREMENT IN ENERGY USE WAS NEARLY LINEARLY CORRELATED WITH PREFABRICATION RATE. PRECAST FACADE AND FORM ARE IDENTIFIED AS ENERGY-INTENSIVE COMPONENTS COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHOD. THEREFORE, THE CHALLENGE LIES IN IMPROVING THE INTEGRALITY AND QUALITY OF THE PREFABRICATION TECHNIQUE WHILE REDUCING ITS DEPENDENCE ON ENERGY-INTENSIVE MATERIALS. BESIDES, ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE MATURITY OF THE PRECAST MARKET TO AVOID ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING PROPHASE INVESTIGATION. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

IN RESPONSE, THIS STUDY INTEGRATES A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT METHOD WITH FIELD BASED OPERATIONAL DATA TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL EMBODIED ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENERGY TRANSFERS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND ASSESS THE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY USE OF RESIDENTIAL AND OFFICE BUILDINGS IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EMBODIED ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE PROVINCIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS LOCALIZATION DOMINANT AND FOSSIL FUEL ORIENTED, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 18.6\% OF THE TOTAL REGIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THE GEOGRAPHICAL CONNECTION AND RESOURCE CHARACTERISTIC ARE THE TWO FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE INTERREGIONAL ENERGY TRANSMISSIONS INDUCED BY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE. THE RESULT OF UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE MEAN VALUE OF ENERGY INTENSITIES SIMULATED BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION IS HIGHLY CONSISTENT WITH THE DETERMINISTIC RESULTS. IT IS CRUCIAL TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS BY PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ECONOMIC INFORMATION. AT LAST, A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCT, AND MANAGEMENT ASPECTS AT THE INDUSTRIAL AND BUILDING LEVELS.

TO REALIZE THE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF LCA TOOLS AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY MINIMIZE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS, AN OPEN APPROACH IS REQUIRED THAT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBLE APPLICATION OF COMPREHENSIVE LCA STUDIES AND EARLY INTEGRATION IN PLANNING PROCESSES. THE AUTHORS PRESENT AN APPROACH FOR LCA INTEGRATION IN ALL PHASES OF DIGITAL PLANNING WHICH AIMS AT A DGNB (DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR NACHHALTIGES BAUEN) CERTIFICATION BASED ON THE OPEN BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) STANDARD INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC). THE APPROACH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARYING LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT AND RESULTING DATA AVAILABILITY DURING INTEGRAL PLANNING PHASES, AS WELL AS RESULTING LCA APPLICATION CONTEXTS. IT GOES BEYOND EXISTING STRATEGIES AND ALLOWS ONE TO CONSIDER BOTH BIM AND LCA SOFTWARE THROUGH A WORKFLOW BASED ON A SINGLE DATA FORMAT. THE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK IS OPERATIONALIZED THROUGH STANDARDIZED INTERFACE DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL REALIZATION FOLLOWING THE INFORMATION DELIVERY MANUAL (IDM) PROCESS STANDARDIZED FOR IFC INTERFACES. THE EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE (XML) SCHEMA, AS A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION FOR CERTIFICATION, PROVIDES THE TARGET SYSTEM FOR LCA DATA REQUIREMENTS AND IS GENERALIZED TO A PLANNING PHASE SPECIFIC IDM BASE TABLE. THE TECHNICAL REALIZATION BASED ON RESPECTIVE MODEL VIEW DEFINITIONS AND DISTRIBUTED DATA SUGGESTS A PATHWAY TO THE STANDARDIZATION OF LCA-IFC INTEGRATION BASED ON AN OPEN APPROACH. THE OVERALL APPROACH EXEMPLARILY APPLIES TO THE ``LERNZENTRUM'' AT THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (KIT) CAMPUS. WE CONCLUDE THAT AN OPEN BIM APPROACH FOR LCA INTEGRATION IN MODEL-BASED PLANNING IS FEASIBLE, BUT REQUIRES SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS IN IFC, LCA, AND PLANNING PRACTICE. ADDING A LIFECYCLE ELEMENT TO THE IFC TO CONNECT BIM AND LCA PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE FEEDBACK FOR INFORMED DECISION MAKING BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT; UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART; HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION; KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","6558","RAFAEL.HORN@IBP.FRAUNHOFER.DE SEBASTIAN.EBERTSHAEUSER@KIT.EDU ROBERTA.DI.BARI@IBP.FRAUNHOFER.DE OLIVIA.JORGJI@IBP.FRAUNHOFER.DE R.TRAUNSPURGER@DGNB.DE PETRA.VONBOTH@KIT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su12166558","OD1RP","2071-1050",NA,NA,"GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND ENERGY BMWI; DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (DFG, GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION) UNDER GERMANY'S EXCELLENCE STRATEGY [EXC 2120/1 -390831618]; KIT-PUBLICATION FUND OF THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","THE PUBLICATION, AS WELL AS THE THEREIN-PRESENTED METHODS AND RESULTS, HAVE BEEN CREATED WITHIN THE RESEARCH PROJECT BIM2LCA4IP AND ARE FUNDED BY THE GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND ENERGY BMWI.

THESIS","KINDERGARTENS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN NURTURING THE PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. HENCE, DESIGNING KINDERGARTEN BUILDINGS REQUIRES THE CONSIDERATION OF THE UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS AND BEHAVIOR OF CHILDREN. CONSIDERING THE RAPID URBANIZATION OF CHINA AND ITS COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING THE 3060 CARBON GOAL, IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE RETROFITTING OF KINDERGARTEN BUILDINGS IN CHINA AND PROPOSE A RETROFIT OPTIMIZATION METHOD FOR KINDERGARTEN BUILDINGS THAT CONSIDERS THERMAL COMFORT, DAYLIGHTING, AND LIFE-CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS. THROUGH THIS METHOD, INFORMATION ON THE THERMAL AND DAYLIGHTING COMFORT OF OCCUPANTS, WEATHER DATA, OCCUPANT SCHEDULING, AND ENVELOPE AND ENERGY SYSTEM OF THE KINDERGARTEN BUILDING TO BE RETROFITTED CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH VARIOUS APPROACHES, SUCH AS VIDEO PLAYBACK, FIELD INVESTIGATION, LITERATURE RESEARCH, AND CONSULT DRAWINGS. ON THIS BASIS, OPTIMIZATION VARIABLES ARE SELECTED, AND A PHYSICAL MODEL IS ESTABLISHED TO GUIDE THE RETROFIT PROCESS. AFTERWARD, A RAPID COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON PARALLEL COMPUTING IS ADOPTED TO OBTAIN THE COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMAL DESIGN SCHEME FOR THE BUILDING TO BE RETROFITTED. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS APPLIED TO A KINDERGARTEN BUILDING RETROFIT CASE IN NANJING, CHINA, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPTIMAL COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS OF 34,158.3 KG, AN INCREASE IN THE THERMAL COMFORT PERIOD OF 2.7\%, AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN DAYLIGHTING COMFORT OF 79.7\% OVER THE BENCHMARK SCHEME. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY EXTENDS BEYOND ITS POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN KINDERGARTEN BUILDING RETROFITS. IT CONTRIBUTES TO ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, CREATING HEALTHIER AND MORE COMFORTABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CHILDREN WHILE MITIGATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS.

THE FULLY SELF-CENTERING BEHAVIOR EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATES THE RESIDUAL DEFORMATION, THEREBY IMPROVING THE POST-EARTHQUAKE REPAIRABILITY OF BUILDING STRUCTURES. HOWEVER, THIS BEHAVIOR DOES INTENSIFY FLOOR ACCELERATION RESPONSES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO NONSTRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND LEAD TO INCREASED INITIAL COSTS. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DEVELOP A GENERAL MACHINE LEARNING AND GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR OPTIMIZING THE DESIGN OF SELF-CENTERING BUILDING STRUCTURES AND TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE INITIAL COSTS AND SEISMIC LOSSES BY MINIMIZING THE OVERALL LIFE-CYCLE COST. THE ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) BASED STRUCTURENET MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR ACCELERATING THE CALCULATION OF LIFE-CYCLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-CENTERING STRUCTURES. THE GENETIC ALGORITHM WAS ADOPTED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR SELF-CENTERING STRUCTURES. THE FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED TO 8 DESIGN CASES, WITH THE ANALYSIS CENTERING ON TWO FACTORS: THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE RESIDUAL INTER-STORY DRIFT FOR CONTROLLING DEMOLITION AND THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST OF SELF-CENTERING MEMBERS. THE STUDY EXAMINED THEIR INFLUENCES ON THE OPTIMIZATION DESIGN RESULTS OF SELF-CENTERING BUILDING STRUCTURES. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT A PREFERENCE FOR A DESIGN APPROACH THAT LEANS TOWARD PARTIALLY SELF-CENTERING BEHAVIOR AS OPPOSED TO FULLY SELF-CENTERING BEHAVIOR, INDICATING THE HIGHER LIFE-CYCLE BENEFITS OF PARTIALLY SELFCENTERING BEHAVIOR.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","KYOTO UNIVERSITY; HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY","107671","SHULING.HU.6@GMAIL.COM LEIXIAOMING@OUTLOOK.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107671","S3KS9","2352-7102","SEP 2023",NA,"JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE (JSPS)","DATA AVAILABILITY DATA WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.

ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE CALCULATED THE LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) OF VGS, THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD IS TIME-CONSUMING AND REQUIRES A LARGE AMOUNT OF DETAILED DATA, WHICH IS UNABLE AND UNPRACTICAL TO OBTAIN LCC OF NEW VGS PROJECTS BY COLLECTING DATA OF ONLY SEVERAL KEY VARIABLES OF VGS. HENCE, AFTER COMPUTING AND ANALYZING THE LCC OF 40 CASES FROM DIFFERENT PROJECTS WITH VARIOUS TYPES, SIZES, AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES, OUR STUDY ESTABLISHED A PREDICTION MODEL FOR THE LCC OF VGS USING THE DATA FROM FORTY CASES OF THREE TYPES OF VGS. MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION (MLR), MLR WITH STEPWISE REGRESSION, AND ORTHOGONAL PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE (OPLS) MODELS WERE BUILT AND COMPARED. AND THE OPLS MODEL WAS SELECTED AS THE PREDICTION MODEL AS IT HAS RELATIVELY GOOD PREDICTION PERFORMANCE AND CAN AVOID THE COLLINEARITY ISSUE ENCOUNTERED BY THE OTHER TWO METHODS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMBINED OPLS MODEL FOR THREE TYPES OF VGS WAS SEPARATED INTO THREE INDIVIDUAL MODELS WITH IMPROVED TOTAL PREDICTION ACCURACY (85.4\%? 95.5\%). IN ADDITION, KEY VARIABLES AFFECTING THE LCC OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VGS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED INCLUDING SALARY, PLANT DENSITY, PLANT PRICE, ETC. APPLICATIONS OF LCC PREDICTION MODELS FOR VGS FOR VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WERE DISCUSSED TO CONCLUDE THE STUDY.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE; NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE; TONGJI UNIVERSITY; TONGJI UNIVERSITY; TONGJI UNIVERSITY","107735","ZIYOUHUANG@U.NUS.EDU TCL@NUS.EDU.SG LU6@TONGJI.EDU.CN BDGWNH@NUS.EDU.SG",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107735","RQ5HS","1873-684X","MAR 2021",NA,"JTC CORPORATION, UNDER THE URBAN GREENERY RESEARCH THRUST OF THE NUS-JTC INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE (I3) RESEARCH CENTRE; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES OF CHINA [22120180624]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [52078374]; NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [17ZDA062]; CHINESE ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING [2020-XZ-15]; OPEN PROJECTS FUND OF SHANGHAI KEY LABORATORY OF URBAN RENEWAL AND SPATIAL OPTIMIZATION TECHNOLOGY [2019010205]; SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMISSION [19DZ1202803]","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY JTC CORPORATION, UNDER THE URBAN GREENERY RESEARCH THRUST OF THE NUS-JTC INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE (I3) RESEARCH CENTRE, THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES OF CHINA (22120180624), NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (52078374), THE NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA UNDER MAJOR PROGRAM (17ZDA062), CHINESE ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING (2020-XZ-15), OPEN PROJECTS FUND OF SHANGHAI KEY LABORATORY OF URBAN RENEWAL AND SPATIAL OPTIMIZATION TECHNOLOGY (2019010205), AND SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMISSION (19DZ1202803).",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A PARAMETRIC-LIFE-CYCLE-CARBONASSESSMENT (PLCCA) MODEL FOR AUTOMATING DATA-INTEGRATION, DYNAMIC-COMPUTATIONS, AND ONLINE-VISUALIZATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS. EMISSION FACTORS (EFS) ARE SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATED AS ADDITIONAL DESIGN PARAMETERS IN THE BIM-MODEL. CARBON EMISSIONS ARE DYNAMICALLY CALCULATED USING PARAMETERIZED INPUTS. RHINO-GRASSHOPPER PLUGINS GENERATE REAL-TIME BAR CHARTS AND COLOR CODES INSIDE BIM-ENVIRONMENTS. MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION (MOO) INCORPORATES CARBON EMISSIONS, MATERIALS, ENERGY, AND COST TO OPTIMIZE DESIGN PARAMETERS AND FACILITATE EARLY DECISIONS. THE PERFORMANCE AND APPLICABILITY OF PLCCA ARE EVALUATED USING A TUNNEL IN YUNNAN, CHINA. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONAL STAGES ACCOUNT FOR 30\% AND 65\% OF CARBON EMISSIONS. TUNNEL IS THEN REMODELED WITH OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS; CARBON EMISSIONS ARE RECALCULATED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONAL PHASES ARE REDUCED BY 32.94\% AND 28.40\%.

VARIOUS INITIATIVES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE THE RELEASE OF GHGS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE RELYING ON THE EVALUATION, TRACKING, RECORDING AND VERIFICATION OF GHG EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS. THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTING OF GHG FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDINGS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED IN A LIFECYCLE CONTEXT TO ENSURE THAT POLICIES ARE EFFECTIVE AT MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. BUILDINGS OPERATE FOR DECADES AND BOTH THE CLIMATE AND ELECTRICITY GRID MIX ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING SUCH A TIME FRAME. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF RESOURCE- AS WELL AS ENERGY-EFFICIENT BUILDINGS USING A SOUND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY IN THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN STAGE. A STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD THAT CAN BE APPLIED FOR A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROSPECTIVE ELECTRICITY GRID MIX ON BUILDING ENERGY USE IS PRESENTED. THE NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INTEGRATE LONG-TERM ENERGY PROJECTIONS IN A HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION LCA FOR BUILDINGS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENT FUTURE CLIMATES AND PROSPECTIVE ELECTRICITY MIXES ACROSS CANADA. THE RESEARCH INTEGRATED THE DYNAMIC LCA CAPABILITIES DIRECTLY INTO A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM). SUCH DYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS AS CLIMATE AND ENERGY MIX IMPROVES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPORTANCE AND SCIENTIFIC ROBUSTNESS OF LCA METRICS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY WILL ASSIST USERS TO APPLY A CLEAR FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS TO DEFINE AN OPTIMIZED DESIGN ALTERNATIVE THROUGH A DYNAMIC ENERGY ANALYSIS AND FUTURE WEATHER FORECASTING SIMULATION. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ACTUAL OFFICE BUILDING IS PROVIDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES AND USEFULNESS OF THE DEVELOPED INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA","102294","FARZAD.JALAEI@NRC-CNRC.GC.CA GEOFFREY.GUEST@NRC-CNRC.GC.CA ABHISHEK.GAUR@NRC-CNRC.GC.CA JIEYING.ZHANG@NRC-CNRC.GC.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.scs.2020.102294","NU3ZT","2210-6715",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2210-6707","SUST.

A COMMON METHOD EMPLOYED FOR THIS QUANTIFICATION IS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH IS GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE METHODS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF BUILDINGS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WOULD BE AN IDEAL PLATFORM TO INTEGRATE LCA TO ASSIST IN THIS PROCESS. HOWEVER, BIM AND LCA TOOLS ARE CURRENTLY NOT FULLY INTEROPERABLE.

RESEARCH ON THE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, FROM PLANNING AND DESIGN TO CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT, HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. THEREFORE, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON RECENT RESEARCH IS PERFORMED TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BIM TECHNIQUE. STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS UNMANNED ROBOTS, SENSORS AND PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, ETC., ARE ALSO REVIEWED. AN INFRASTRUCTURE BIM PLATFORM FRAMEWORK COMPOSED OF BIM AND STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES IS THEN PROPOSED. THE PROPOSED PLATFORM IS A WEB-BASED PLATFORM THAT CONTAINS QUANTITY, SCHEDULE (4D), AND COST (5D) CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT, AND THE MONITORING SYSTEMS ENABLE COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN A COMMON DATA ENVIRONMENT (CDE). THE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY, AFTER INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION, IS THEN COMPLETED AND IS DEVELOPED USING STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUES USING UNMANNED ROBOTS, SCAN-TO-BIM, AND DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS, ETC. IT IS CONFIRMED THAT COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CDE IN CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT IS POSSIBLE USING AN INFRASTRUCTURE BIM PLATFORM. MOREOVER, LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS POSSIBLE BY SYSTEMATIC MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS TIME HISTORY ANALYSIS, DAMAGE GROWTH PREDICTION, DECISION OF REPAIR AND DEMOLITION, ETC., USING A REGULAR INSPECTION DATABASE BASED ON AN INFRASTRUCTURE BIM PLATFORM.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","SEJONG UNIVERSITY; KOREA INSTITUTE OF CIVIL ENGINEERING \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY (KICT)","10310","JJ99137@SJU.AC.KR JWKIM@JUDICO.CO.KR KBJU@KICT.RE.KR YUNKYUAN@SEJONG.AC.KR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/app112110310","XB2UB","2076-3417",NA,NA,"KOREA AGENCY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT (KAIA) - MINISTRY OF LAND, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TRANSPORT [21SCIP-C121389-06]","THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE KOREA AGENCY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT (KAIA) GRANT FUNDED BY THE MINISTRY OF LAND, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND TRANSPORT (GRANT 21SCIP-C121389-06).",NA,NA,"APPL.

THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY (CE) COULD OFFER AN APPROACH TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. FOR A TRANSITION TOWARDS A CIRCULAR BUILT ENVIRONMENT, A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT METHOD IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCULAR BUILDING PRODUCTS. AS A STEP TOWARDS SUCH A METHOD, WE DEVELOPED AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IN THE FORM OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY LIFE CYCLE COST (CE-LCC) MODEL. IT IS BASED ON EXISTING LIFE CYCLE COST TECHNIQUES AND ADAPTED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF CE PRODUCTS. THE MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO (1) CONSIDER PRODUCTS AS A COMPOSITE OF COMPONENTS AND PARTS WITH DIFFERENT AND MULTIPLE USE CYCLES, (2) INCLUDE PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE AFTER THE END OF USE, (3) PROVIDE PRACTICAL AND USABLE INFORMATION TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS, AND (4) FACILITATE ALIGNMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT AND SYSTEM BOUNDARIES WITH LCA. TO TEST THE MODEL, IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE CASE OF THE CIRCULAR KITCHEN (CIK). THREE VARIANTS OF THE CIK WERE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER AND THE `BUSINESS-AS-USUAL' CASE TO DETERMINE WHICH VARIANT IS THE MOST ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE ON THE LONG TERM. THE MODEL INDICATES THAT THE MOST FLEXIBLE VARIANT OF THE CIK HAS THE LOWEST LCC OUTCOME, EVEN WHEN CONSIDERING MULTIPLE INTEREST, LIFESPAN AND REMANUFACTURING AND RECYCLING SCENARIOS. ALTHOUGH, THE MODEL COULD BENEFIT FROM FURTHER RESEARCH AND APPLICATION, IT CAN SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE (BUILDING) INDUSTRY.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","104857","B.JANSEN-3@TUDELFT.NL",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104857","NO6PA","1879-0658",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0921-3449","RESOUR.

THIS STRATEGY MEANS THAT NO LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED OVER THE DESIGN PROCESS. YET, WHILE MANY STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THE LCC-BASED DESIGN OF REGULAR STRUCTURES UNDER EARTHQUAKE LOADS, RARE STUDIES HAVE APPLIED IT TO IRREGULAR STRUCTURES. FURTHERMORE, THE LACK OF UTILIZATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) CAPABILITIES IN PREVIOUS LCC-BASED DESIGN IS EVIDENT. THIS STUDY AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF IRREGULARITY ON OPTIMIZING THE LCC OF HIGH-RISE STEEL STRUCTURES BY PROVIDING AN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR SEISMIC DESIGN OF REGULAR AND IRREGULAR STRUCTURES INTEGRATING THE CAPABILITIES OF LCC AND BIM. USING BIM, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LIMITATIONS OF LCC ANALYSIS, SUCH AS TIME SPENT IN DATA COLLECTION AND EXCHANGE, AND TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY AND SPEED OF CALCULATIONS. THE FRAMEWORK HERE FIRST COMBINES RESULTS OF DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURAL AND STRUCTURAL SOFTWARE THROUGH PROGRAMMING WITHIN MATLAB ENVIRONMENT AND THEN USES NSGA-II ALGORITHM FOR ESTABLISHING A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INITIAL COST AND LCC. TO CHECK THE WORKABILITY OF THE FRAMEWORK, SIX 3D TALL STEEL STRUCTURES, WITH 10-, 13-, AND 20-FLOORS, IN TWO CATEGORIES OF REGULAR AND SETBACK IRREGULAR ARE FIRST DESIGNED FOR GRAVITY AND SEISMIC LOADS AND THEIR PERFORMANCE USING NON-LINEAR ANALYSES ARE THEN ANALYZED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INDIRECT COSTS OF IRREGULAR STRUCTURES WERE RELATIVELY HIGHER THAN REGULAR ONES WHILE HIGHER INITIAL COST NEEDED TO REDUCE LCC. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR BOTH THE 20-STORY REGULAR AND IRREGULAR STRUCTURES, A 15\% INCREASE IN INITIAL COSTS RESULTED IN A 24 AND 17\% REDUCTION IN THEIR LCCS, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THAT IRREGULAR STRUCTURES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUSTAINING EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE THAN REGULAR ONES, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK HERE CAN FURTHER PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF IRREGULAR STRUCTURES FROM AN LCC-BASED PERSPECTIVE.","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","AMIRKABIR UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","474","BEHROUZ.BEHNAM@UQCONNECT.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s41062-024-01790-1","M1S4B","2364-4184",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2364-4176","INNOV.

IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECTING BUILDING LIFESPAN; THEREFORE, MOST LCAS ASSUME A STANDARD BUILDING LIFESPAN FOR EACH MAJOR TYPE OF BUILDING STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE LIFESPANS OF BUILDINGS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN PRACTICE, AND APPLYING A UNIFORM LIFESPAN TO ALL BUILDINGS WITH THE SAME STRUCTURAL TYPE MAY LEAD TO COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS LCA RESULTS. IN THIS STUDY, LCAS OF WATERPROOFING METHODS ON BUILDING MODELS AND ACTUAL BUILDINGS IN KOREA ARE USED TO EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECT OF REALISTIC LIFESPAN PREDICTION USING BIG DATA. APPLYING A MORE REPRESENTATIVE BUILDING LIFESPAN OF 5-39 YEARS IN THE WATERPROOFING LCAS OF AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL DECREASED THE CARBON EMISSIONS IN ALL PHASES (CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AND DEMOLITION) BY 78-24\%, RESPECTIVELY, RELATIVE TO A 50 YEAR LIFESPAN ASSUMPTION. DURING THE MAINTENANCE PHASE, THE REDUCTIONS WERE 100-31\%, RESPECTIVELY. THE ACCURACY OF THE WATERPROOFING LCAS OF 17 REAL BUILDINGS BECAME MORE IRREGULAR AS THE PERCENTAGE ERROR OF THE PREDICTED LIFESPAN INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE LCA ANALYSIS RESULTS HAD 0\% ERROR FOR BUILDINGS WITH A PREDICTED LIFESPAN ERROR OF 6\% OR LESS. THEREFORE, DEPENDING ON THE RESEARCH PURPOSE, A LOW-ERROR PREDICTIVE BUILDING LIFESPAN MODEL CAN EVIDENTLY SUPPORT ACCURATE LCA RESULTS. THIS STUDY PROVES THAT THE USE OF A BIG DATA-BASED BUILDING LIFESPAN PREDICTION METHOD IS ESSENTIAL FOR LCA AND IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR BUSINESS PLANNING AND CRITICAL DECISION MAKING THROUGHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","KOREA AEROSPACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (KARI); KOREA ADVANCED INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY (KAIST)","107028","MUNYI@KAIST.AC.KR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107028","Q2PM4","2352-7102","JUN 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

AN ESTIMATION OF THE BUILDING'S LIFE SPAN IS ESSENTIAL TO CARRYING OUT THESE METHODS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DIVERSE FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE BUILDING'S LIFE SPAN, IT WAS ESTIMATED TYPICALLY BASED ON ITS MAIN STRUCTURAL TYPE. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT BUILDINGS HAVE DIFFERENT LIFE SPANS. SIMPLY ASSUMING THAT ALL BUILDINGS WITH THE SAME STRUCTURAL TYPE FOLLOW AN IDENTICAL LIFE SPAN CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ESTIMATION ERRORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE COLLECTED 1,812,700 RECORDS DESCRIBING BUILDINGS BUILT AND DEMOLISHED IN SOUTH KOREA, ANALYSED THE ACTUAL LIFE SPAN OF EACH BUILDING, AND DEVELOPED A BUILDING LIFE-SPAN PREDICTION MODEL USING DEEP-LEARNING AND TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING. THE PREDICTION MODELS EXAMINED IN THIS STUDY PRODUCED ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERRORS OF 3.72-4.6 AND THE COEFFICIENTS OF DETERMINATION OF 0.932-0.955. AMONG THOSE MODELS, A DEEP-LEARNING BASED PREDICTION MODEL WAS FOUND THE MOST POWERFUL. AS ANTICIPATED, THE CONVENTIONAL METHOD OF DETERMINING A BUILDING'S LIFE EXPECTANCY USING A DISCRETE SET OF SPECIFIC FACTORS AND ASSOCIATED ASSUMPTIONS OF LIFE SPAN DID NOT YIELD REALISTIC RESULTS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT AN APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING TO THE LCA AND LCC OF A BUILDING IS A PROMISING DIRECTION, EFFECTIVELY GUIDING BUSINESS PLANNING AND CRITICAL DECISION MAKING THROUGHOUT THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","KOREA ADVANCED INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY (KAIST)","108267","MUNYI@KAIST.AC.KR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108267","WC1WZ","1873-684X","AUG 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF STRUCTURES IS OF SIGNIFICANCE IN WHOLE LIFE MANAGEMENT, AND BIM PROVIDES A USEFUL TOOL TO ASSESS THE DURABILITY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING STRUCTURES AT THE DESIGN STAGE. CRACKING IS A SIGNIFICANT DURABILITY PROBLEM IN REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES AS IT DESTROYS THE INTEGRITY OF THE STRUCTURES AND CAUSES PREMATURE FAILURE. IT IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE TO PREDICT THE CRACKING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES AND INTEGRATE THE MODEL IN BIM PLATFORM SO THAT BETTER-INFORMED DECISIONS CAN BE MADE FOR DESIGNERS IN TERMS OF REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. IN THIS PAPER, THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (FEM) AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) ARE COMBINED TO PREDICT CONCRETE CRACKING OVER TIME. THE COMBINED METHOD IS ACHIEVED IN THE BIM APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) TO REALISE THE WHOLE LIFE MANAGEMENT. MOREOVER, MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES ARE DEVELOPED WHICH HAVE AN IMPACT ON STRUCTURE BEARING CAPACITY AND COST ANALYSIS. MEANWHILE, OPTIMISED CONSTRUCTION PROCESS DECISION COULD BE MADE TO ALLOW DESIGNERS AND PRACTISING ENGINEERS TO UNDERSTAND THE SERVICEABILITY AND ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE STRUCTURES EASILY.","PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, SOUTH HOLLAND, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF STRATHCLYDE",NA,NA,NA,"ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS, MECHANICS AND APPLICATIONS","2024-12-23",NA,"BO2AY",NA,NA,"ZINGONI, A",NA,NA,"978-0-429-42650-6; 978-1-138-38696-9",NA,NA,"ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS, MECHANICS AND APPLICATIONS","ENGLISH",NA,"7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING, MECHANICS AND COMPUTATION (SEMC), CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA, SEP 02-04, 2019","16",NA,NA,"DOUGLAS, JOHN/0000-0003-3822-0060 YANG, SHANGTONG/0000-0001-9977-5954","NATL RES FDN S AFRICA; S AFRICAN NATL ROADS AGCY LTD; ADINA R \& D INC","2090-2095","CRC PRESS-BALKEMA","ENGINEERING; MATERIALS SCIENCE","YANG, SHANGTONG/AAR-1148-2020 DOUGLAS, JOHN/A-3098-2011 ",NA,0,"BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING IN WHOLE LIFE MANAGEMENT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000504648100360","0","6",NA,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL; MATERIALS SCIENCE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2019,"JIANG QIANQIAN;DOUGLAS JOHN;YANG SHANGTONG","JIANG, QQ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV STRATHCLYDE, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, GLASGOW, LANARK, SCOTLAND","ISI","ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS, MECHANICS AND APPLICATIONS","UNIV STRATHCLYDE;UNIV STRATHCLYDE","UNIV STRATHCLYDE",NA,"JIANG Q, 2019, ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS, MECHANICS AND APPLICATIONS","JIANG Q, 2019, ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS, MECHANICS AND APPLICATIONS",NA

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL CLOUD APPROACH THAT, FOCUSING ON CHINA'S SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS, PROPOSES A SERIES OF AS-BUILT BIM (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING) TOOLS AND A SELF-ORGANISED APPLICATION MODEL THAT CORRELATES PROJECT ENGINEERING DATA AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATA THROUGH A SEAMLESS BIM AND BSNS (BUSINESS SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES) FEDERATION. TO ACHIEVE A LOGICALLY CENTRALISED SINGLE-SOURCE DATA STRUCTURE, A UNIFIED DATA MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED THAT INTEGRATES TWO CATEGORIES OF HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF HANDLERS. BASED ON THESE MODELS, KEY TECHNICAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA ARE PROPOSED AND IMPLEMENTED, INCLUDING PERMISSION, DATA MANIPULATION AND FILE VERSION CONTROL. SPECIFICALLY, A DYNAMIC GENERALISED LIST SERIES IS PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THE SOPHISTICATED CONSTRUCTION FILE VERSIONING ISSUE. THE PROPOSED CLOUD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED IN REAL APPLICATIONS IN CHINA. THIS RESEARCH WORK CAN ENABLE DATA SHARING NOT ONLY BY INDIVIDUALS AND PROJECT TEAMS BUT ALSO BY ENTERPRISES IN A CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE WAY THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THIS SYSTEM WILL REDUCE COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION FIRMS BY PROVIDING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MEANS AND GUIDES TO COMPLEX PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AND BY FACILITATING THE CONVERSION OF PROJECT DATA INTO ENTERPRISE-OWNED PROPERTIES.

IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT COSTS ARE OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO THE DECISION MAKER. THE SELECTION PROCEDURE PRIMARILY DEPENDS ON THE MATERIAL AVAILABILITY AS WELL AS EMPIRICAL INFORMATION. AFTERWARD COSTS IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE LACK CONSIDERATION, WHICH IS MAINLY CONSTRAINED BY DATA AVAILABILITY AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE RIGID PIPE AND EVALUATES THE COMPARABLE APPLICATION OF REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE (RCP), NON-REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE (NRCP), AND VITRIFIED CLAY PIPE (VCP) IN SEWER SYSTEMS. THE LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED THROUGHOUT THE MATERIAL MANUFACTURING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE PHASES. PARTICULARLY, THE MARKOV CHAIN MODEL IS USED TO PREDICT SYSTEMS' CONDITIONS THAT ARE USED AS A GUIDANCE FOR MANAGEMENT IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE. UNDER A GIVEN STRATEGY, THE COST ESTIMATE IS EXTENDED TO THE STEADY STATE, PROVIDING A NEW COST COMPARISON PERSPECTIVE. IN ADDITION, METHODS TO EVALUATE THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY ARE ALSO PRESENTED. APPLYING THE BOOTSTRAPPING APPROACH, THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE MARKOV CHAINS MODEL DEMONSTRATES DECENT ROBUSTNESS. IN THE CASE STUDY OF A 24-IN. PIPE APPLICATION, RESULTS SHOW THAT NRCP DEMANDS THE LEAST INITIAL BUILDING COST, WHILE RCP IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE CONSIDERING LONGER SERVICE LIFE TIME. COST COMPARISON AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE ALSO PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH ALLOWS DECISION-MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE ECONOMIC COSTS DURING ALTERNATIVE SELECTIONS IN PRACTICE. THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED MAY ALSO BE APPLIED IN THE LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.

THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK TOWARDS A THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE FACTORS ACCOUNTING FOR VARIATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF LIFE CYCLE DATA ACROSS COUNTRIES. IT DOES SO BY POSITING A MECHANISM LINKING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS' INSTITUTIONAL ROLE WITHIN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PROCESSES TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCT LIFE DATA AND BY EMPIRICALLY VALIDATING IT. METHODS INTERVIEWS, QUALITATIVE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS, WEB SCRAPING, QUANTITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS, SET-THEORETICAL CAUSAL REASONING, AND PROCESS TRACING. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAT STIPULATE INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT DELIBERATIONS AND ASSIGN A COORDINATING OR MEDIATING ROLE TO INDUSTRY PEAK ASSOCIATIONS CAN STIMULATE THE EXCHANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AMONG INDUSTRIAL SECTORS. THE POLICY INSTRUMENTS OF DETERMINATION OF `BEST AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES' (BAT) TOWARDS STANDARD SETTING, NEGOTIATED COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS AND CARBON PRICING ALL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF ORGANISED INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITHIN INDUSTRY.

THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT UNDER THE SERVICE CONDITION TARGET OF 100 YEARS, WHEN THE OPEN FLEXIBLE TECHNIQUE IS USED FOR THE DESIGN, SPACE UTILIZATION FLEXIBILITY IS ENHANCED, PIPELINE MAINTENANCE IS CONVENIENT, WASTE IS REDUCED, AND PERFORMANCE IN LIFE CYCLE COST IS BETTER. BIM CAN PREDICT PERFORMANCE SIMPLY AND RAPIDLY ACCORDING TO FUTURE USAGE DEMAND ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE INITIAL DESIGN.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","837","RIK@MAIL.NTUST.EDU.TW JUMPER0605@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/app7080837","FF4JE","2076-3417",NA,NA,"ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING RESEARCH INSTITUTE, MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, TAIWAN [PG10401-0558]","THIS STUDY WAS FUNDED BY THE ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING RESEARCH INSTITUTE, MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, TAIWAN, AS PROJECT NO.

THE STUDY TESTS THE SUITABILITY OF AN INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (IO-LCA) APPROACH IN SCREENING LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS IN COMPANIES. IT ESTIMATES THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF THREE PRODUCTS AND ASSESSES THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH APPROACH IN A COMPANY ENVIRONMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS THE MULTIPLE CASE STUDIES EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF AN IO-LCA METHOD IN A COMPANY ENVIRONMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE LIFE CYCLE COST AND IMPACT STUDY OF THREE PRODUCT SYSTEMS (BUILDING VENTILATION SYSTEM, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) NETWORK PRODUCT, AND WELDING MACHINE) IS CONDUCTED AND THE LIFE CYCLE PHASES WITH HIGHEST ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTION ARE DETERMINED. SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RESULTS TO MAJOR CHANGES IN THE STUDIED SYSTEMS. FINALLY, THE USABILITY OF THE IO-LCA APPROACH FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS IN COMPANIES IS ASSESSED BY COLLECTING DATA ON WORKLOAD AND INTERVIEWING THE PARTICIPATING WORKERS AND MANAGERS. RESULTS THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE USE PHASE WITH OPERATING ENERGY WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPORTANT IN ALL EVALUATED ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, ONLY IN ONE CASE (ICT NETWORK PRODUCT) THE USE WAS THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT LIFE CYCLE PHASE. IN TWO OTHER CASES, THE SOURCING WAS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH IS MUCH EASIER TO ADAPT BY CURRENT MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY LINKS LIFE CYCLE COSTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND, BY ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, REDUCES THE WORKLOAD IN COMPANIES. DISCUSSION IT APPEARS THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH CAN BE USED TO SCREEN ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT LIFE CYCLE PHASES OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS IN COMPANIES BY UTILIZING READILY AVAILABLE ACCOUNTING OR OTHER DOCUMENTED DATA. THE IO-LCA APPROACH PRODUCED COMPARABLE RESULTS WITH THE ONES PUBLISHED IN TRADITIONAL PROCESS-BASED LCA LITERATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN RESULTS, SOME PRACTICAL BENEFITS OF USING THE IO-LCA COULD ALSO BE SUGGESTED: THE APPROACH WAS VERY FAST TO USE AND WOULD THUS ALLOW AN EASIER ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS IN COMPANIES AS WELL AS WIDER ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING OF PRODUCTS IN EARLY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE. CONCLUSIONS THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH COULD CLEARLY OFFER ADDED VALUE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES. THE IO-LCA WAS FOUND TO PROVIDE A VERY FAST ACCESS TO THE KEY LIFE CYCLE CHARACTERISTICS OF PRODUCTS. SIMILARLY, IT OFFERED PRACTICAL MEANS TO INTEGRATE LIFE CYCLE THINKING INTO EXISTING BUSINESS ROUTINES AND TO ACTIVATE THE DECISION MAKERS IN COMPANIES BY GIVING THEM EASILY COMPREHENDIBLE RESULTS. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES THE RESULTS WOULD SUGGEST THAT SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL IO TABLES, BESIDES THE US ONES USED HERE, WOULD HAVE VALUE AND SHOULD BE COLLECTED FOR OTHER MAJOR GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMICAL REGIONS. THE TABLES WOULD ENABLE A MUCH LARGER SHARE OF COMPANIES TO MANAGE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. IT ALSO SEEMS THAT, BECAUSE THE USER PROFILE IS SO DOMINANT IN THE CASE OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS, MORE STUDIES, BOTH THEORETICAL (HOW TO VALUATE THE FUTURE BEHAVIOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES?) AND EMPIRICAL (WHAT REALLY CREATES VALUE FOR USERS?), SHOULD FOCUS ON THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","AALTO UNIVERSITY",NA,"SEPPO.JUNNILA@TKK.FI",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-008-0015-y","330RN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0948-3349","INT.

RAILWAY TURNOUTS ARE USED TO CHANGE DIRECTION OF TRAINS FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. THEY REQUIRE HIGH-QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE, IN ORDER TO MINIMISE RAPID DEGRADATION AND COMPONENT FAILURES THAT COULD RESULT IN TRAIN DERAILMENTS. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF RAILWAY TURNOUTS, THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MAINTENANCE CAN BE IMPROVED BY INTEGRATING EXISTING PRACTICE BY BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM). THIS RESEARCH ESTABLISHES AND ANALYSES THE WORLD'S FIRST 6D BIM FOR LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT OF A RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM. THE BIM (LEVEL 3) HAS INTEGRATED 6-DIMENSIONS OF FIELD DATA INFORMATION BASED ON REVIT-2018 AND NAVISWORKS-2018 PLATFORMS. THE DIGITAL TWINS OF A RAILWAY TURNOUT IN 3D EMBRACE TIME SCHEDULE, COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE. THE USE OF BIM FOR RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEMS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL INFORMATION FLOW OF THE TURNOUT PLANNING AND DESIGN, MANUFACTURING PRE-ASSEMBLY AND LOGISTIC, CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT AND DEMOLITION, THEREBY ACHIEVING BETTER PROJECT PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY. BASED ON INTEGRATED INFORMATION OF RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM, THE 6D BIM HAS THE ABILITY TO ASSESS ON ECONOMIC, MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY, AND ACHIEVE A BALANCE AMONG THEM. THIS IS THE WORD FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BIM CAN FULLY DELIVER ITS ESSENTIAL BENEFITS BY INFORMATION SHARING, EASING TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION, IMPROVING DESIGN QUALITY, REDUCING OF DESIGN ERRORS, ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION, SPEEDING UP WORK, SHORTENING CONSTRUCTION DURATION, REDUCING CONSTRUCTION COSTS, ENHANCING CARBON EFFICIENCY, SUPPORTING PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AND PROVIDING ITS OWNERS WITH HIGHER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OVER THE RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM LIFE-CYCLE. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT EMBODIED MATERIAL EMISSION IS THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS CARBON FOOTPRINT, ESPECIALLY PRODUCED DURING THE MANUFACTURING STAGE. THE RECONSTRUCTION STAGE CONTRIBUTES THE MOST EXPENSIVE PHASE OF LIFE CYCLE. THE INSIGHT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT THE CO-VALUE CREATION AMONG ENGINEERS, PROJECT MANAGERS, TECHNICIANS, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD.

OWING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF BRIDGE DESIGN, TRADITIONAL DESIGN METHODS ALWAYS CREATE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES. IN RECENT YEARS, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED RAPIDLY TO PROVIDE A FASTER SOLUTION TO GENERATE AND PROCESS THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION IN A SHARED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT AN INNOVATIVE 6D BIM APPROACH FOR THE LIFECYCLE ASSET MANAGEMENT OF A BRIDGE INFRASTRUCTURE BY USING DONGGOU BRIDGE AS A CASE STUDY. THIS PAPER ADOPTS 6D MODELLING, INCORPORATING 3D MODEL INFORMATION WITH TIME SCHEDULE, COST ESTIMATION, AND CARBON FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS ACROSS THE LIFECYCLE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT. THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER REVEAL THAT RAW MATERIALS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS, AND AS THE 6D BIM MODEL WAS DEVELOPED IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE LIFECYCLE, STAKEHOLDERS CAN COLLABORATE WITHIN THE BIM ENVIRONMENT TO ENHANCE A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE OUTCOME IN ADVANCE. THIS STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITY OF BIM APPLICATIONS TO BRIDGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LIFECYCLE. THE 6D BIM CAN SAVE TIME BY TRANSFORMING 2D INFORMATION TO 3D INFORMATION AND REDUCING ERRORS DURING THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION STAGES THROUGH BETTER VISUALISATION FOR STAFF TRAINING. MOREOVER, 6D BIM CAN PROMOTE EFFICIENT ASSET AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT SINCE IT CAN BE APPLIED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES SIMULTANEOUSLY, SUCH AS SUSTAINABILITY, LIFECYCLE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE, CONDITION MONITORING AND REAL-TIME STRUCTURAL SIMULATIONS.

THE RESEARCH STUDY FOCUSED ON EVALUATING DESIGN ALTERNATIVES USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM)-ENABLED VR TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATED WITH COST AND SUSTAINABILITY LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) SOFTWARE. IN DOING SO, THE PAPER BEGINS WITH REVIEWING THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN THE MENTIONED AREAS. THEREAFTER, IT ADOPTS AN EXPERIMENTAL-QUALITATIVE-QUANTITATIVE METHOD TO TEST THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS AND ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF 360-DEGREE VR ON THE USERS (66 PARTICIPANTS), WHILE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN USERS WHO HAVE A RELEVANT BACKGROUND IN BUILDING/CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING (I.E., ARCHITECT ENGINEERS AND CIVIL ENGINEERS), AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT (I.E., OWNERS AND CLIENTS). IT IS OBSERVED THAT DESPITE THEIR BACKGROUND, THE USER PARTICIPANTS POSITIVELY EMBRACE THE IDEAS AND ASPIRATIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY, AND THAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF RESPONDENTS PREFERRING THE ECONOMY OVER SUSTAINABILITY. LIKEWISE, THE PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT MAKING AN EFFORT TO MEASURE THE EMISSIONS OF THEIR DESIGN OPTIONS RATHER THAN FOCUS ON THE BUILDING'S ECONOMIC ASPECTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","AARHUS UNIVERSITY","249","AK@ENG.AU.DK 201803177@POST.AU.DK 201802744@POST.AU.DK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su13010249","PQ2OB","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JAN",NA,"56","1","GOLD, GREEN SUBMITTED","KAMARI, ALIAKBAR/0000-0003-2566-9520",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","KAMARI, ALIAKBAR/AFM-7439-2022 ",NA,28,"BIM-ENABLED VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) FOR SUSTAINABILITY LIFE CYCLE AND COST ASSESSMENT","ARTICLE","WOS000606387800001","8","70","13","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"KAMARI ALIAKBAR;PAARI ASHWIN;TORVUND HENRIK OIEN","KAMARI, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), AARHUS UNIV, DEPT ENGN, DK-8000 AARHUS, DENMARK","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","AARHUS UNIV;AARHUS UNIV","AARHUS UNIV",NA,"KAMARI A, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY","KAMARI A, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

WORK-RELATED FATALITIES DUE TO FALLS, SLIPS, AND TRIPS HAVE BEEN INCREASING, WITH HISPANIC WORKERS AMONG THE HIGHEST FATALITIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FALL ACCIDENTS AND ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS AGE, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (MSPS), SLEEP HOURS, SAFETY KNOWLEDGE, USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE), AND WORKING HOURS AMONG HISPANIC CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INVOLVED IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. THIS STUDY COLLECTED 220 VALID RESPONSES AND USED NONPARAMETRIC CHI-SQUARE TESTS AND BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THE LOCATION OF THE FALL, MSPS, AND USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING FALL ACCIDENTS. THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF FALL ACCIDENTS WAS ``FALL FROM A LADDER'' FOLLOWED BY HAVING TWO OR THREE MSPS. THE USE OF PPE HAD THE HIGHEST DECREASING RATIO IN ODDS OF FALL ACCIDENTS, INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING PPE PROPERLY. THE RESULTS SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING SAFETY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WITHIN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS' BROADER LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT. THE INSIGHTS LIST HOW PROJECT ENGINEERS CAN INCORPORATE THESE FINDINGS INTO BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE PROJECT PLANNING AND SAFETY MEASURES IN REDUCING FALL-RELATED ACCIDENTS AND THEIR SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.

LCC HAS A NUMBER OF RELEVANT APPLICATIONS, THESE INCLUDE PROJECT APPRAISAL; FACILITIES MANAGEMENT; PROCUREMENT AND TENDERING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION. ALTHOUGH THESE ADVANTAGES ARE WELL RECOGNISED, THE PROCESS IS UNDERUTILISED DUE TO A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTED BARRIERS TO ADOPTION. NOTABLY THESE INCLUDE LACK OF ACCURATE HISTORICAL DATABASES; THE PERCEIVED COMPLEXITY AND TIME CONSUMING NATURE OF THE CALCULATIONS; LACK OF A STANDARD LCC METHODOLOGY, AND THAT CLIENTS ARE NOT REQUESTING LCC. THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IS FRAMED IN RECOGNITION OF THESE BARRIERS, INVESTIGATING A PROCESS THAT COULD AFFECT CHANGE BY INCREASING EFFICIENCY IN THIS AREA. A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTION PROCUREMENT IS BEING INCREASINGLY UTILISED AS A COLLABORATIVE SET OF PROCEDURES AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ASSIST DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONS IN CONCEIVING, DESIGNING, CONSTRUCTING AND OPERATING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH 5D BIM (COST MODELLING) IS CURRENTLY BEING USED IN QUANTITY SURVEYING (QS) PRACTICE, BIM IS NOT EXTENSIVELY USED IN THE APPLICATION OF LCC AND THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED RESEARCH IN THIS AREA TO DATE. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 5D BIM BASED LCC SOLUTION, WHERE LCC IS INTEGRATED INTO THE 5D BIM PROCESS BY EMBEDDING AN LCC CALCULATION MODEL STRUCTURE WITHIN AN EXISTING 5D BIM TECHNOLOGY. THIS PROCESS REPRESENTS A CHANGE TO THE 5D BIM WORKFLOW, ADDING ON A FACILITY FOR LCC THROUGH POST-PROCESSING BIM DATA. THE RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT UNDER A DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, TO DEVELOP AND THEN EVALUATE THE SOLUTION PROPOSED. AN EVALUATION METHOD KNOWN AS `THINKING ALOUD COOPERATIVE EVALUATION' IS USED TO GAIN FEEDBACK FROM A SAMPLE OF QSS UTILISING THE 5D BIM BASED LCC SOLUTION. THE PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION IS TO GAUGE WHETHER LCC CAN BE EFFECTIVELY EMBEDDED IN A 5D BIM PLATFORM. THE CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE IS THE ARTICULATION OF A PROCESS WHICH EXTENDS 5D BIM FOR LCC, BY LEVERAGING AN EXISTING 5D BIM TECHNOLOGY. THE FINDINGS OUTLINE THAT THE PRIMARY BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED PROCESS/SYSTEM IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR A LINK BETWEEN THE QSS COST PLANS/BOQ'S AND THEIR LCC CALCULATIONS IN AN INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT.","KRUISPLEIN 25 G, PO BOX 1837, ROTTERDAM, 3000 BV, NETHERLANDS","TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY DUBLIN; UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD",NA,"DERMOT.KEHILY@DIT.IE J.UNDERWOOD@SALFORD.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23",NA,"FH5HA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1874-4753","J.

SMART AIRPORTS UTILIZE NEW CONNECTED TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE END-USER EXPERIENCE WHILE ENSURING OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY IN AERONAUTICAL AND NON-AERONAUTICAL SEGMENTS. THE INCREASING NEED FOR DIGITIZING THE DESIGN-BUILD-OPERATE LIFE CYCLES OF AIRPORTS CAN BE MET BY IMPLEMENTING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) THAT ENABLES ACCESSING, MANAGING, UTILIZING, AND CONNECTING PHYSICAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA IN A DIGITAL COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT STATE OF PRACTICE IN AIRPORT BIM (ABIM) AND THE USE OF ABIM PROCESSES IN DIGITAL AIRPORT OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BY CONNECTING EXISTING DATA SOURCES AND INTEGRATING SMART AIRPORT SYSTEMS. THE STUDY PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE AND ADAPTIVE ABIM MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT DEPICTS THE ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTIVITY OF ABIM PROCESSES, RESOURCES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH AIRPORT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BY IDENTIFYING GAPS IN THE INDUSTRY AND LITERATURE, AND DEVELOPING A GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING IN ABIM VISIONS. RESEARCH DATA ARE COLLECTED THROUGH LITERATURE AND INDUSTRY REVIEW, ONLINE SURVEYS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH AVIATION PROFESSIONALS. MIXED METHODS INCLUDING NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE ELEMENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK. MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (MBSE) PRINCIPLES AND LANGUAGE ARE USED TO GENERATE THE FRAMEWORK. FOR FRAMEWORK VALIDATION, A PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC) IS CONDUCTED BY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A WEB-BASED APPLICATION. THE DEVELOPED ABIM FRAMEWORK IS EXPECTED TO GUIDE MAJOR AIRPORT STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR BIM IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES TO ENHANCE AIRPORT OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND IN STRATEGIZING DIGITAL INITIATIVES ON A CONNECTED-BIM PLATFORM.","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY","0361198120917971","BKESKIN@SYR.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1177/0361198120917971","MF9XB","2169-4052","MAY 2020",NA,"AIRPORT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (ACRP) [11-04]","THE AUTHOR(S) DISCLOSED RECEIPT OF THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE RESEARCH, AUTHORSHIP, AND/OR PUBLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE: THIS PROJECT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE AIRPORT COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (ACRP) (ACRP [GRADUATE RESEARCH AWARD] 11-04).",NA,"0361-1981","TRANSP.

FOLLOWING EN 15804:2012+A2:2019, THE STUDY EMPLOYS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY, FOCUSING ON EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL CARBON. ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPDS), INVENTORY OF CARBON AND ENERGY (ICE) DATABASE, AND THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS (RICS) GUIDELINE INFORM EMBODIED CARBON CALCULATIONS. RESULTS SHOW THE GREEN ROOF SYSTEM RELEASES 263,839.56 KGCO(2)E AS EMBODIED CARBON, WHILE ITS SEDUM LAYER SEQUESTERS 211,468.12 KGCO(2)E OVER A 50-YEAR LIFESPAN. ENERGY EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS INDICATES A 3.3 KWH/M(2)/YR REDUCTION IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION, LEADING TO A 112,130.31 KGCO(2)E REDUCTION IN OPERATIONAL CARBON EMISSIONS, HIGHLIGHTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF GREEN ROOF ADOPTION. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST A 0.35\% MITIGATION OF WHOLE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS, WITH GREATER IMPACT IN SITUATIONS OF LOWER INSULATION EFFECTIVENESS, SHOWCASING THE POTENTIAL OF GREEN ROOFS IN REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS.

IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE, THE EVALUATION OF SEISMIC LOSS HAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON ESTIMATING THE MEAN VALUE OF THE LIFE CYCLE COST WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FULL EXTENT OF SEISMIC LOSS VARIABILITY. THE PROPOSED METHOD AIMS TO EMPLOY THE FEMA-P-58 APPROACH IN EVALUATING THE PROBABILISTIC DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL SEISMIC REPAIR COST IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF A STRUCTURE. THIS METHOD ALSO CONSIDERS THE EFFECT OF TIME-DEPENDENT PHENOMENA ON LOSS EVALUATION WHILE IT KEEPS THE REQUIRED COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT AT AN AFFORDABLE LEVEL. A MONTE CARLO SAMPLING TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED TO CONSIDER ALL SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTIES. IN THIS APPROACH, THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STRUCTURE IS EXTRACTED FROM THE INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS RESULTS, AND THERE IS NO NEED TO REPEAT COMPLEX DYNAMIC ANALYSIS CALCULATIONS IN EACH REALIZATION. TO BETTER DEMONSTRATE THE PROPOSED METHOD, THE LIFE CYCLE COST OF A 5-STORY STEEL SPECIAL MOMENT FRAME IS INVESTIGATED WITH VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ON ITS TIME-DEPENDENT SPECIFICATIONS SUCH AS THE MONETARY DISCOUNTING EFFECTS, THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT DISCOUNT RATES AND BUILDING DEPRECIATION OVER TIME.","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","TARBIAT MODARES UNIVERSITY; SAHAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"MARZIEH.KHALILIAN@MODARES.AC.IR SHAKIB@MODARES.AC.IR BASIM@SUT.AC.IR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.istruc.2021.10.062","2H9IP",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2352-0124","STRUCTURES","STRUCTURES","ENGLISH","FEB",NA,"51",NA,NA,"CHARKHTAB BASIM, MOHAMMAD/0000-0002-5124-6700",NA,"280-290","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","ENGINEERING","BASIM, MOHAMMAD/F-6750-2017 CHARKHTAB BASIM, MOHAMMAD/E-4955-2015",NA,4,"PROPOSED TIME-DEPENDENT APPROACH TO SEISMIC LOSS EVALUATION THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A STRUCTURE","ARTICLE","WOS000814600800003","2","10","36","ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2022,"KHALILIAN MARZIEH;SHAKIB HAMZEH;BASIM MOHAMMAD CH","SHAKIB, H (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TARBIAT MODARES UNIV, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TEHRAN, IRAN","ISI","STRUCTURES","TARBIAT MODARES UNIV;TARBIAT MODARES UNIV;SAHAND UNIV TECHNOL","TARBIAT MODARES UNIV",NA,"KHALILIAN M, 2022, STRUCTURES","KHALILIAN M, 2022, STRUCTURES",NA

THEREFORE, HAVING APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT AND VALUATION STRATEGIES IS A CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR. MOST ESTABLISHED VALUATION METHODS EMPHASIZE MARKET VALUE AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AND ARE IGNORANT ABOUT BUILDINGS' TECHNICAL AND STRUCTURAL ATTRIBUTES. THEREFORE, DUE TO THE PROCESS AMBIGUITY AND LACK OF INFORMATION ACCESS, THE ESTIMATED PRICE USUALLY DIFFERS FROM THE REAL PROPERTY VALUE. IN THIS RESEARCH, A REVISED VALUATION FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED BASED ON THE LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES, FOCUSING ON THE OPERATION PHASE. LCC CONSISTS OF ALL COSTS RELATED TO AN ASSET DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF ITS LIFECYCLE, AND IT HELPS DETERMINE THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. FOR SYSTEMATICALLY STORING AND ANALYZING TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WAS PROPOSED. DESPITE BEING WIDELY USED IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES, ITS APPLICATION AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND MANAGERS DURING THE OPERATION PHASE ARE NOT TRANSPARENT. THIS RESEARCH BENEFITTED FROM THE 5D BIM MODEL WITH A LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (LOD) OF 300 TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND VALIDITY OF VALUATION. AN 18.25\% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CALCULATED PRICE OF TWO CASE STUDIES IN TEHRAN AND THEIR INFLATED MARKET PRICES PROVED THIS ASSERTION.

DESPITE NUMEROUS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES INDICATING THAT GLOBAL WARMING EFFECTS DUE TO LIFETIME ENERGY CONSUMPTION ARE THE GREATEST IN THE BUILDING OPERATION STAGE, THE ABSENCE OF A STANDARD GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) REPORT BASED ON BUILDING ENERGY USAGE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EXAMINE REALISTIC GWP REDUCTION DIRECTIONS. IN SOUTH KOREA, ENERGY DATA FOR NUMEROUS BUILDINGS WERE COLLECTED THROUGH THE BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY CERTIFICATION (BEEC) FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WITH DATA FROM APARTMENT BUILDINGS RECEIVING THE MOST ATTENTION. GWP EMISSIONS WERE EVALUATED USING THE DATA THROUGH GREEN STANDARD FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN LCA. HERE, WE DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS TO ASSESS MUTUAL PROPRIETY FOR GWP EMISSIONS (E) AND ENERGY EFFECTIVE AREA RATIO (R-E) DURING BUILDING OPERATION TO SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF GWP EMISSIONS CAUSED BY LIFETIME OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION RESULTING FROM PLANNING AND DESIGN. WE COLLECTED APARTMENT BEEC DATA AND USED THEM TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY EFFECTIVE AREA RATIO AND GWP EMISSIONS OF EACH BUILDING, WHICH WERE THEN CLASSIFIED BY ENERGY USE AND SOURCE. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BETWEEN R-E AND E FOR EACH CLASSIFICATION, AND THE DERIVED REGRESSION EQUATION WAS DEVELOPED AS A GWP ASSESSMENT MODEL FOR APARTMENTS. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS EXAMINED THROUGH A CASE STUDY, WHICH CONFIRMED THAT THE MODEL CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE DESIGN DIRECTIONS FOR REDUCING GWP EMISSIONS FOR EVERY ENERGY IN APARTMENTS.","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","KOREA NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF TRANSPORTATION; HANYANG UNIVERSITY; KUMOH NATIONAL UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY","2420","HJLIM0422@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1038/s41598-023-29142-6","VM4ZZ",NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA (NRF) - KOREA GOVERNMENT (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1C1C1010475]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA (NRF) GRANT FUNDED BY THE KOREA GOVERNMENT (MSIT) (GRANT NO.

BASED ON THIS, WE ALSO DEVELOP THREE INDICATORS TO REPRESENT THE FUTURE PROSPECTS OF A SERVICE'S LIFE CYCLE PROGRESSION. THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH LIE IN ITS ABILITY TO MODEL DIFFERENT SHAPES OF LIFE CYCLES WITHOUT ANY SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND TO EXAMINE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES AT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF TIME AND COST.

PROMPTLY EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOADS OF THE VARIOUS DESIGN ALTERNATIVES DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND ADOPTING THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE CANDIDATE IS THEREFORE OF LARGE IMPORTANCE. YET, RESEARCH ON THE EARLY EVALUATION OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD IN ORDER TO AID THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS HITHERTO LACKING. IN LIGHT OF THIS DILEMMA, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD BY EMPLOYING ONLY THE MOST BASIC INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE DURING THE EARLY DESIGN PHASES OF A PROJECT FOR THE PRE-STRESSED CONCRETE (PSC) BEAM BRIDGE, THE MOST COMMON BRIDGE STRUCTURE. FIRSTLY, A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) WAS CONDUCTED ON THE DATA FROM 99 BRIDGES BY INTEGRATING THE BILLS OF QUANTITIES (BOQ) WITH A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) DATABASE. THE PROCESSED DATA WAS THEN UTILIZED TO CONSTRUCT A CASE BASED REASONING (CBR) MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD. THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATION MODEL WAS THEN VALIDATED USING FIVE TEST CASES; THE MODEL'S MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR RATES (MAER) FOR THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD WAS CALCULATED AS 7.09\%. SUCH TEST RESULTS WERE SHOWN TO BE SUPERIOR COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED FROM A MULTIPLE-REGRESSION BASED MODEL AND A SLAB AREA BASE-UNIT ANALYSIS MODEL. HENCEFORTH APPLICATION OF THIS MODEL DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF A PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO HIGHLY COMPLEMENT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DESIGNS AND CONSTRUCTION BY FACILITATING THE SWIFT EVALUATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD FROM MULTIPLE STANDPOINTS.

THREE RECENTLY BUILT APARTMENT BUILDING COMPLEXES WERE CHOSEN AS STUDY OBJECTS FOR THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF THEIR EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL, OZONE LAYER DEPLETION POTENTIAL, PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDANT CREATION POTENTIAL, AND ABIOTIC DEPLETION POTENTIAL), USING THE LCA APPROACH. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANALYZED THE EMISSION TRENDS ACCORDING TO THE CUT-OFF CRITERIA OF THE SIX ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES BY PERFORMING AN S-LCA WITH CUT-OFF CRITERIA 90-99\% OF THE CUMULATIVE WEIGHT PERCENTILE. CONSEQUENTLY, WE WERE ABLE TO PRESENT THE CUT-OFF CRITERION BEST SUITED FOR S-LCA AND ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF THE CUT-OFF CRITERIA ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS RESULTS.

THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROPOSED AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK OF ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS USING SCAN-TO-BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LCA IN EXISTING BUILDINGS. TO VERIFY THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. A BIM MODEL WITH AN ERROR RATE OF 1.442\% CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED FROM THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) POINT CLOUD USING PARAMETRIC ALGORITHM. THE TOTAL COST FOR THE TARGET CASE WAS CALCULATED AT USD 162,769, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COST ACCOUNTED FOR THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE AT 97.15\%.

THE USE OF THESE MODELS REQUIRES THAT THE BUILDING UNDER EXAMINATION BE SUBDIVIDED INTO MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DETAIL. WE EMPLOY A 3D MODEL OF THE BUILDING FOR CREATING AND VISUALIZING THE DIFFERENT SYSTEM LEVELS. AT THE SAME TIME THE 3D MODEL FORMS THE BASIS OF ANY DATA ACQUISITION, ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION. THE SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED BY COUPLING A JAVA 3D FRONT-END WITH A RELATIONAL DATABASE, IN WHICH THE CONSTRUCTION GEOMETRY AND ALL RELATED INFORMATION IS STORED. DUE TO THE LONG LIFE SPAN OF BRIDGE STRUCTURES, THE SOFTWARE IS REQUIRED TO SATISFY SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF ITS FLEXIBILITY.

OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE TRANSPORT WORLDWIDE IS CARRIED BY SHIPS. AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008 THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY EXPERIENCED TURBULENCES WHICH HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE VOLUME OF TRADE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS AN OVERCAPACITY OF SHIPS CRUISING ON THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD. MANY OF THE OLDER SHIPS WERE DECOMMISSIONED AND SCRAPPED. NUMEROUS SCRAPYARDS ARE IN SOUTH ASIA, WHERE THE SHIPS ARE DISMANTLED UNDER HARSH WORKING CONDITIONS AND WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. A LOT OF THESE SCRAP YARDS ARE MERELY BEACHES WHERE THE SHIPS ARE BEACHED (BEACH-BREAKING YARDS) AND DISASSEMBLED MANUALLY. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND EFFORTS EXIST TO TACKLE THIS KIND OF END-OF-LIFE TREATMENT OF SHIPS WHICH IS DANGEROUS FOR HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE BASEL CONVENTION TO CONTROL HAZARDOUS WASTE, TO WHICH DISPOSED SHIPS ALSO BELONG. IN 2009 THE HONG KONG CONVENTION WAS ADOPTED, WHICH AIMS AT REDUCING THE RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT DURING THE RECYCLING OF SHIPS. JUST RECENTLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THE EU SHIP RECYCLING REGULATION TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS LINKED TO THE RECYCLING OF EU-FLAGGED SHIPS. THE REGULATION SETS OUT A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR EUROPEAN SHIPS, EUROPEAN SHIP OWNERS AND SHIP RECYCLING FACILITIES. CONFRONTING EXISTING CHALLENGES OF SHIP SCRAPPING AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES A LITERATURE RESEARCH IS PERFORMED TO ASSESS IN WHAT WAY THE END-OF-LIFE OF SHIPS HAS BEEN COVERED IN LCA STUDIES. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS AN OWN APPROACH TO AN END-OF-LIFE (EOL) ASSESSMENT IS SET UP AND ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMPLE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE EOL OF CARGO SHIPS, A SIMPLIFIED MODEL BASED ON THE MENTIONED PREEXISTING INFORMATION IS CREATED. ALL THREE PHASES: SHIP BUILDING, SHIP OPERATION AND SHIP SCRAPPING ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. TWO SCENARIO GROUPS FOR THE SHIP SCRAPPING WERE DEFINED, WITH DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO RE-USE AND RECYCLING. THE OVERALL CONTRIBUTION OF THE END-OF-LIFE PHASE TO THE LIFE CYCLE (CONSTRUCTION OF THE SHIP, USE, EOL) OF A SHIP IS RANGED AND EVALUATED. THE RESULTS OF THE ASSESSED SCENARIOS CONFIRM THAT THE RE-USE AND RECYCLING PROCESS IS ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE. HOWEVER, THE PROCESSES AND HUMAN LABOUR HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YET. THE OVERALL IMPACT ON THE LIFECYCLE REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE WITHIN THE ASSESSED IMPACT CATEGORIES. A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE EOL ON THE LIFECYCLE MIGHT BE SEEN IF OTHER IMPACT CATEGORIES, SUCH AS INDICATORS FOR RESOURCE EFFICIENCY ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.","17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE","UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART","101","NATHANAEL.KO@LBP.UNI-STUTTGART.DE",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1051/mattech/2015002","DG6HP","1778-3771",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-6895","MATER.

CURRENTLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT AFFECTS THE GHG EMISSIONS OF BUILDINGS LOCATED IN WARMER CLIMATES, A TYPICAL SITUATION FOR MANY EMERGING ECONOMIES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A STUDY OF EMISSIONS FROM BRAZILIAN OFFICE BUILDINGS USING BUILDING ARCHETYPES. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS EXPLORES POSSIBLE PARAMETER RANGES, VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO LIFE -CYCLE IMPACTS AND THEIR KEY DRIVERS. FOR EACH OF THE 1000 BUILDING VARIATIONS IN THE SAMPLE, THE EMISSIONS WERE CALCULATED USING A LIFE -CYCLE ASSESSMENT. MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS ENABLED THE STUDY OF THE RESULTS' SENSITIVITY TO 10 PARAMETERS, INFLUENCING BUILDING OPERATION, DESIGN AND OTHERS. THE EMISSIONS RANGED FROM 20 TO 106 KG CO2-EQ/M2 GROSS FLOOR AREA AND YEAR. ELECTRICITY MIX, CLIMATE AND COOLING EFFICIENCY WERE THE MOST IMPACTFUL PARAMETERS, BUT BUILDING COMPONENT SERVICE TIME WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT.","UNIT 3N, 6 OSBORN STREET, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND","NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY (NTNU)",NA,"KAMILA.KRYCH@NTNU.NO",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.5334/bc.136","OP1L9",NA,NA,NA,"FUNDING - NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (NTNU); RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY [300330]","<B>FUNDING</B> THIS WORK WAS FUNDED BY THE NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (NTNU) AND THE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY (GRANT NUMBER 300330) .",NA,"2632-6655","BUILD.

THESE EMISSIONS ARE GENERATED BY ENERGY, WATER, AND MATERIALS CONSUMED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND DISPOSAL PROCESSES AND DURING THE RECYCLING AND REUSING OF CONSTRUCTION COMPONENTS AS MATERIALS OR BIOMASS. CARBON-EMISSION MODELING IS A COMPLEX PROCEDURE OF PROCESS AND FOOTPRINT INTEGRATION FOR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS EITHER DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVICE, PRODUCT, MATERIAL, OR SYSTEM AT DIFFERENT PHASES. PRIOR RESEARCH FOCUSED ON EACH PHASE SEPARATELY AND/OR SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK OF BUILDING LIFECYCLE CARBON-EMISSION MODELING THAT WOULD INTEGRATE EXISTING MODELS, INFORMATION, AND DATA. THIS RESEARCH INTEGRATED PRIOR MODELS AND METHODS, INCORPORATED MULTITIER MECHANISMS, AND DEVELOPED FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE MODEL SO THAT RELIABILITY WOULD BE IMPROVED FOR MEASURING, TRACKING, AND QUANTIFYING CARBON-AND ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED FEATURES, FACTORS, AND VARIABLES.

COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) ARE FOUND IN THE FOREFRONT OF THIS EVOLUTION, PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN CREATING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE UPCOMING DEVELOPMENT OF SMART LOW-CARBON CITIES. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL OF BIM IS STILL UNTAPPED - LINKS WILL NEED TO BE CREATED AMONG THE AVAILABLE AND FORTHCOMING METHODOLOGIES UNDER ONE INTEGRAL OPERATIONAL SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED BIM-BASED LIFE CYCLE-ORIENTED FRAMEWORK FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTIONS AT THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE. THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK REPRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF THE APPROACHES THAT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WILL NEED TO ADOPT TO INTEGRATE THE DIFFERENT TOOLS UNDER AN INTEGRATED SMART CITY CONTEXT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH FOLLOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOUR SAME-VOLUME DIFFERENT-CONFIGURATION THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIM DESIGNS, WHICH ARE COUPLED WITH LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TOOLS FOR ESTABLISHING SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN. FINDINGS THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER INDICATED THAT THE CHOICE OF BUILDING DESIGN AND SHAPE CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN REDUCING THE EMBODIED ENERGY AND EMBODIED CARBON OF BUILDINGS, ACHIEVING A REDUCTION OF UP TO 15\% COMPARED TO A REFERENCE BUILDING OF SAME VOLUME AND GROSS FLOOR AREA. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS PAPER IS FOUND IN ITS APPROACH APPLICATION BY COUPLING THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIM MODELS WITH LCA DATA, THE USE OF REINFORCEMENT DETAILING IN AN ND BIM STUDY AND THE EMPLOYMENT OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC LCA DATABASES.","FLOOR 5, NORTHSPRING 21-23 WELLINGTON STREET, LEEDS, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","KAUNAS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"ENG.FP@FREDERICK.AC.CY",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/CI-02-2021-0011","HQ0H5","1477-0857","SEP 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-4175","CONSTR.

THE PRESENT STUDY IS AN ADVANCEMENT TOWARDS THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF A LINEAR DIELECTRIC-BASED BUILDING-INTEGRATED CONCENTRATING PV SYSTEM BY MEANS OF MULTIPLE LIFE-CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS (RECIPE, ECO-INDICATOR 99, ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT, USETOX, RECIPE-BASED AND ECO-INDICATOR-99-BASED PAYBACK TIMES (PBT5), ETC.), PROVIDING A DETAILED ANALYSIS. TWO CONFIGURATIONS (WITH AND WITHOUT REFLECTIVE FILM) ARE EXAMINED, FOR DIFFERENT CITIES (BARCELONA, EXETER AND DUBLIN). BY FOCUSSING ON MATERIAL MANUFACTURING (SYSTEM WITH REFLECTIVE FILM), IN GENERAL, RECIPE (ENDPOINT/SINGLE-SCORE; POINTS) RESULTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE TO ECOINDICATOR 99 (SINGLE-SCORE; POINTS) FINDINGS AND BASED ON BOTH METHODS PVS HAVE THE MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION FOR ECOSYSTEMS/ECOSYSTEM QUALITY AND HUMAN HEALTH. MOREOVER, BASED ON USETOX RESULTS, THERE IS A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPACT OF THE PVS AND THE IMPACT OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE PBT5, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH CONFIGURATIONS WITH/WITHOUT REFLECTIVE FILM, BARCELONA PRESENTS THE LOWEST RECIPE AND ECO-INDICATOR-99 PBT5 RANGING FROM 3.6 TO 5.8 YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXETER AND DUBLIN SHOW PBTS FROM 3.7 TO 7.8 YEARS. ACCORDING TO RECIPE/ENDPOINT RESULTS WITH CHARACTERIZATION, FOR CLIMATE CHANGE/HUMAN HEALTH (SYSTEM WITH REFLECTIVE FILM) BARCELONA SHOWS 1.2 X 10(-7) DISABILITY ADJUSTED -LIFE-YEARS PER KWH WHILE DUBLIN AND EXETER PRESENT A FOOTPRINT OF PRESENT ABOUT 1.8 X 10(-7) DISABILITY-ADJUSTED-LIFE-YEARS PER KWH. RESULTS IN TERMS OF (SPECIES.YR)/KWH ARE ALSO PRESENTED (RECIPE/ENDPOINT WITH CHARACTERIZATION), FOR SEVERAL SCENARIOS. REGARDING THE TWO CONFIGURATIONS, THE FINDINGS BASED ON MULTIPLE APPROACHES VERIFY THAT REFLECTIVE FILM CONSIDERABLY IMPROVES THE ECO-PROFILE OF THE REFERENCE SYSTEM (CONFIGURATION WITHOUT REFLECTIVE FILM). FOR EXAMPLE, BY UTILIZING REFLECTIVE FILM THERE IS A REDUCTION OF RECIPE-BASED AND ECO-INDICATOR-99-BASED PBT5 RANGING FROM 0.5 TO 0.9 YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE SCENARIO. FINALLY, RESULTS FROM THE LITERATURE ARE PRESENTED ALONG WITH. RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY AND A CRITICAL DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED. CONCLUSIVELY, THE PROPOSED LCA MODEL CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO SIMILAR SYSTEMS, PROVIDING USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE AND OFFERING THE POSSIBILITY TO SELECT AMONG DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS THE BEST FROM ECOLOGICAL/CLEANER PRODUCTION POINT OF VIEW.

SUSTAINABLE HEALTHY BUILDINGS REFER TO THOSE BUILDINGS THAT MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF HEALTH PERFORMANCE FOR THEIR LIFECYCLE. THE HEALTH PERFORMANCE CAN BE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF TIME, SPACE AND HEALTH FACTORS. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON HEALTHY BUILDINGS HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON POLLUTANT EMISSIONS FROM MATERIALS AND EVALUATION INDICATORS, AND THE STUDIES CONDUCTED ON PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO SPECIFIC AREAS SUCH AS INDOOR AIR QUALITY (IAQ). HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE LIFECYCLE HEALTH PERFORMANCE OF HEALTH FACTORS INCLUDING IAQ, TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, NOISE AND LIGHTING. IN ADDITION, A COMPUTING MODEL IS REQUIRED TO EASILY AND PROMPTLY CALCULATE THE HEALTH FACTORS AND SHARE HEALTH PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RESULTS DURING THE PLANNING, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O \& M) PHASES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROPOSE A COMPUTING MODEL FOR LIFECYCLE HEALTH PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (LHPE MODEL) OF SUSTAINABLE HEALTHY BUILDINGS. THE LHPE MODEL CONSISTS OF A LIFECYCLE HEALTH PERFORMANCE TREE (LHT) MODEL, A PROCESS MODEL AND AN INFORMATION MODEL. THE LHPE MODEL IS INTENDED TO BE USED AS A TOOL TO DRAW OUT THE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS WITH EASE AND QUICKNESS, WHEN THE EVALUATION INDICATORS OF THE FACTORS ARE COMPLETED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","KYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY",NA,"KIMSKUK@KHU.AC.KR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1177/1420326X12469553","132AX","1423-0070",NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA (NRF); KOREA GOVERNMENT (MEST) [2012-0000609]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA (NRF) GRANT FUNDED BY THE KOREA GOVERNMENT (MEST) (NO. 2012-0000609).",NA,"1420-326X","INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON.","INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT","ENGLISH","FEB",NA,"27","1",NA,NA,NA,"7-20","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING; PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH","KIM, JONG-MIN/J-5435-2012",NA,7,"A COMPUTING MODEL FOR LIFECYCLE HEALTH PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF SUSTAINABLE HEALTHY BUILDINGS","ARTICLE","WOS000318041200002","7","49","22","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2013,"LEE GOONJAE;NA YOUNGJU;KIM JEONG TAI;KIM SUNKUK","KIM, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KYUNG HEE UNIV, DEPT ARCHITECTURAL ENGN, YONGIN 446701, GYEONGGI DO, SOUTH KOREA","ISI","INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON","KYUNG HEE UNIV;KYUNG HEE UNIV","KYUNG HEE UNIV",NA,"LEE G, 2013, INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON","LEE G, 2013, INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON",NA

IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A METHOD OF PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE BASED ON BIM BELOW THE LEVEL OF DETAIL 2 AND ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION COST DATA TO SUPPORT THE DECISION-MAKING IN THE EARLY DESIGN PHASE. TO VERIFY THE PROPOSED METHOD, A WEB-BASED PROTOTYPE WAS IMPLEMENTED AND APPLIED TO THREE TEST CASES. THE RANGE OF ERROR RATE FOR THREE TEST CASES WAS 1.93-7.16\% (AVERAGE ERROR RATE: 5.18\%). IT SATISFIES THE CRITERIA (-30\% \~ +50\%) OF THE ``AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COST ENGINEERING''. AS A RESULT, THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS VALIDATED.

MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED HOW TO ENHANCE MATERIAL CONTROL OR PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT WITH RFID. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF INTEGRATED UNDERSTANDING OF LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AND DEMONSTRATES A FRAMEWORK TO INFORMATION LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (ILM) WITH RFID FOR MATERIAL CONTROL. THE ILM FRAMEWORK INCLUDES KEY RFID CHECKPOINTS AND MATERIAL TYPES TO FACILITATE MATERIAL CONTROL ON CONSTRUCTION SITES. IN ADDITION, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A CONTEXT-AWARE SCENARIO TO EXAMINE MULTIPLE ON-SITE CONTEXT AND RFID PARAMETERS. FROM TAGGING NODES AT THE FACTORY TO READING NODES AT EACH LIFECYCLE STAGE, THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW TO MANAGE COMPLEX CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS WITH RFID AND HOW TO CONSTRUCT INTEGRATED INFORMATION FLOWS AT DIFFERENT LIFECYDE STAGES. TO VALIDATE KEY MATERIAL TYPES AND THE SCENARIO, THE STUDY REPORTS ON TWO ON-SITE TRIALS: READ DISTANCE TEST AND ON-SITE SIMULATION. FINALLY, THE RESEARCH PROVIDES DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDED APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTING ILM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ILM FRAMEWORK HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ADOPT RFID IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY. THIS PAPER PROVIDES THE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ILM WITH RFID FOR MATERIAL CONTROL, WHICH CAN SERVE AS A BASE FOR ADOPTING OTHER IT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY.

EXISTING BIM-BASED GREEN BUILDING EVALUATION TECHNIQUES MOSTLY RELY ON EXTERNALLY PROVIDED EVALUATION TOOLS, WHICH POSE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEROPERABILITY, INCLUDING A LACK OF DATA COMPATIBILITY AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED FOR FORMAT CONVERSION. TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS, THIS STUDY SETS OUT TO DEVELOP A TEMPLATE (THE GREEN TEMPLATE) FOR EVALUATING THE EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF USING A BIM DESIGN TOOL AS PART OF BIM-BASED BUILDING LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. FIRSTLY, THE BIM LEVEL OF DETAIL (LOD) WAS DETERMINED TO EVALUATE THE EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, AND CONSTRUCTED A DATABASE OF THE IMPACT FACTORS OF THE EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE MAJOR BUILDING MATERIALS, THEREBY ADOPTING AN LCA-BASED APPROACH. THE LIBRARIES OF MAJOR BUILDING ELEMENTS WERE DEVELOPED BY USING THE ESTABLISHED DATABASES AND COMPILED EVALUATION TABLE OF THE EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE BUILDING MATERIALS. FINALLY, THE GREEN TEMPLATE WAS DEVELOPED AS AN EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION TOOL AND A CASE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO TEST ITS APPLICABILITY. THE RESULTS OF THE GREEN TEMPLATE-BASED EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION OF A TEST BUILDING WERE VALIDATED AGAINST THOSE OF ITS ACTUAL QUANTITY TAKEOFF (2D TAKEOFF), AND ITS RELIABILITY WAS CONFIRMED BY AN EFFECTIVE ERROR RATE OF 5\%. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE SUBSTANCES DISCHARGED FROM CONCRETE PRODUCTION PROCESS ON SIX ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES, I.E., GLOBAL WARMING (GWP), ACIDIFICATION (AP), EUTROPHICATION (EP), ABIOTIC DEPLETION (ADP), OZONE DEPLETION (ODP), AND PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDANT CREATION (POCP), USING THE LIFE A CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHOD.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE APPLICATION OF GREEN DESIGN CONCEPT IN ARCHITECTURE, PROMOTE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURE, AND REALIZE THE RATIONAL UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. FIRST, ACCORDING TO THE LIFE CYCLE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THEORIES, BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IS DIVIDED INTO THREE LEVELS: ECONOMY, ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIETY. SECOND, BASED ON THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY, THE ECONOMIC EVALUATION MODEL, ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION MODEL, AND SOCIAL EVALUATION MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE ARE ESTABLISHED. MOREOVER, THE LIFE CYCLE COST, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION, AND SOCIAL IMPACT EVALUATION OF BUILDINGS AT DIFFERENT STAGES ARE ANALYZED TO REALIZE THE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY AND PROMOTE THE GREEN DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. THE RESULTS DENOTE THAT THE PRE-PROJECT COST ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOWEST PROPORTION IN THE SUSTAINABLE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDINGS WITHOUT DISCOUNT. THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COST IS THE HIGHEST, ACCOUNTING FOR 65.4\%. REGARDING NET PRESENT VALUE, THE PROJECT COST IS MAINLY INSTALLATION, OUTDOOR, ETC., WITH 61.5\%, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND DEMOLITION EXPENSES DECREASES. ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE, WORKERS' WELFARE GREATLY IMPACTS SOCIETY, AMONG WHICH FAIR SALARY, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL WELFARE HAVE AN IMPACT DEGREE OF 0.15, 0.175, AND 1.714, RESPECTIVELY. ECONOMICALLY, AFTER CONSIDERING THE DISCOUNT RATE, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE CAN SAVE COSTS MORE EFFECTIVELY. AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEVEL, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. THE SOCIAL WELFARE AT THE WORKER LEVEL HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SOCIETY, WHICH EXTENDS TO ALL STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE, AND THE IMPACT AT THE WORKER LEVEL IS HIGHER THAN THE SOCIAL VALUE LEVEL, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL SITUATION, AND VERIFIES THE QUANTIFIABLE ABILITY OF THE MODEL TO THE SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF BUILDINGS. IN THIS STUDY, LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS AND BIM TECHNOLOGY ARE INTEGRATED TO REALIZE THE EVALUATION OF BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL ASPECTS, THUS ENHANCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FIELD OF ARCHITECTURE AND MAKING SOME CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROMOTING THE RATIONAL UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES.","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","CHONGQING JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY",NA,"DONGLL@CQJTU.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s13762-023-05272-2","GC3J7","1735-2630","OCT 2023",NA,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHONGQING MUNICIPAL EDUCATION COMMISSION [KJQN202200734]; RESEARCH ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND APPLICATION OF GREEN AND LOW CARBON HABITAT ENVIRONMENT IN CHONGQING EAST RAILWAY STATION AREA [2022-KJ-JY-20, CSTB2022TIAD-KPX0195]","THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHONGQING MUNICIPAL EDUCATION COMMISSION (GRANT NO.

SIMULTANEOUSLY, EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT IN MANY CASES, WHERE FASTENING SYSTEMS ARE IMPLEMENTED - SUCH AS INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THE DESIGN OF FASTENERS IS GOVERNED BY FATIGUE LOADING UNDER DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS. IN ORDER TO PERFORM AN ADEQUATE DESIGN AND TO SPECIFY THE MOST EFFICIENT AND APPROPRIATE FASTENING PRODUCT, THE ENGINEER NEEDS TO ACCESS AND PROCESS A BROAD RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL INFORMATION. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM), AS A DATA MANAGEMENT METHOD IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, CAN SUPPLY SUCH INFORMATION AND ACCOMMODATE A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN AND SPECIFICATION PROCESS. FURTHERMORE, THE APPLICATION OF BIM-BASED PROCESSES, SUCH AS THE GENERATION OF A BIM-MODEL, ALLOWS TO USE THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS THE LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT WITH DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND TIME DEPENDENCIES OF THE ASSET AND ITS COMPONENTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE BIM MODEL OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO CORRELATE DIFFERENT DATA RELEVANT FOR ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF THE RESPECTIVE APPLICATION, IN ORDER TO ENSURE A MORE EFFECTIVE AND CORRECT DESIGN OF THE FASTENING.

IN THIS OBJECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEND TO ORGANIZE WORK EXECUTION BY IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE, LINKED AND SEQUENTIAL PROCESSES, MAKING FULL USE OF EVERY WORK EFFORT AND LIMITING WORK DUPLICATION AND REWORK. SINCE THE `90S, THE 3D-MODELING IS USED TO COORDINATE, PLAN, BUILD AND MANAGE FUTURE STRUCTURES. THE BIM APPROACH PROPOSES TO STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTELLIGENT CENTRALLY SHARED 3D-MODEL MAKING USE OF EVERY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS MODEL, FACILITATING THE COORDINATION, SOLVING THE INTERFACES, REDUCING DUPLICATION EFFORTS AND CARRYING THE DEVELOPED DATA INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE STRUCTURE AND BEYOND THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. COMPLETING A COMPLEX STRUCTURE REQUIRES AN IMPORTANT LEVEL OF DESIGN MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN ARCHITECT, DESIGNER, MECHANIC, ELECTRICIAN, AND OTHER DESIGNERS. BASIC INPUT IS REQUIRED FROM EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS. NOW, FOR A GOOD REASON, EVERYONE IN CHARGE OF THE PROCESS IS FOCUSED ON ACHIEVING THEIR PROCESS WITH LESS COST AND LESS TIME. THUS, HE INADVERTENTLY REDUCES THE EFFORT ASSOCIATED WITH SURROUNDING OR SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS, AND FOCUSES ON HIS MAIN RESULT. FOR EXAMPLE, STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING DEVELOPING A 3D-MODEL WILL FOCUS ON CLEAN STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOCUSING ON STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY, GEOMETRY IDENTIFICATION, AND CALCULATION MODEL FOR FINITE ELEMENTS OF SOFTWARE. LIKEWISE, A MECHANICAL ENGINEER WILL MODEL PLUMBING AND MECHANICAL NETWORKS FOR FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION PURPOSES.

TO REDUCE THE RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, RELEVANT POLICIES AND MEASURES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED IN DIFFERENT PLACES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THE PROCESS OF POLICY FORMULATION, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MOST ENERGY-SAVING POLICIES FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS SEEMS TO BE UNSATISFACTORY. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ANALYZED THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR A SINGLE BUILDING OR FOR THE WHOLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, FEW OF THEM INVESTIGATED THE LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT THE CITY LEVEL. SINCE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE KEY IMPLEMENTERS FOR THE REDUCTION OF URBAN ENERGY CONSUMPTION, A CITY-LEVEL ANALYSIS ON THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IS HIGHLY NEEDED FOR THE POLICY MAKING. TO FILL THE RESEARCH GAP, THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A LIFE-CYCLE DYNAMIC SIMULATION MODEL TO FULLY REVEAL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT THE CITY LEVEL. THIS EASY-TO-USE MODEL IS VALIDATED BY A CASE STUDY OF BEIJING, WHICH DEMONSTRATES ITS APPLICABILITY AND CAPABILITY TO HELP ANALYZE MULTIPLE INDICATORS OF RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND THE DYNAMIC TRENDS OF THESE INDICATORS FOR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.

TO DEAL WITH THESE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES, THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A BIM-ENABLED BLM SYSTEM FOR PROPERTY OWNERS USING A SEMI-CUSTOM APPROACH. FOR THIS, A THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE OF THE BIM-ENABLED BLM SYSTEM IS DESIGNED. NEXT, THE SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED BASED ON A REAL-LIFE PROJECT IN THE GRID STATE OF CHINA. THIS CASE SCENARIO VERIFIES THE SYSTEM AND FURTHER CONFIRMED THE PROPOSED THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE. THE DEVELOPED ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEM HAVE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS' BLM IMPLEMENTATIONS.

HOWEVER, COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE LIFECYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THESE MATERIALS REMAINS SCARCE, PLAGUED BY ISSUES OF DATA UNCERTAINTY, ACCESSIBILITY, AND SCOPING DISCREPANCIES. THEREFORE, A PROBABILISTIC LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENT APPROACH WAS ADOPTED IN THIS STUDY, ENABLING UN-CERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF THE CARBON EMISSION INTENSITY OF MAGNESIUM PHOSPHATE CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE 10.5TH PERCENTILE OF THE CARBON EMISSION INTENSITY SIMULATIONS FOR MPC STANDS AT 0.624 KGCO2E/ KG, SUGGESTING THAT NEARLY 90\% OF THE VALUES SURPASS THOSE OF OPC, THEREBY REFUTING THE PRESUMPTION OF ITS LOW-CARBON ATTRIBUTES. NOTABLY, THE CONSUMPTION AND CARBON EMISSION FACTORS OF MAGNESIUM OXIDE AND SOLUBLE PHOSPHATES EMERGE AS PIVOTAL INFLUENCES ON ITS CARBON EMISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WAS EMPLOYED TO FORECAST THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CONSTITUENTS OF MAGNESIUM PHOSPHATE CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS AND THE VOLUME OF CARBON EMISSIONS. THROUGH THIS STUDY, WE CAN HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF MAGNESIUM PHOSPHATE CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS IN TERMS OF CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION, WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR THE SELECTION AND DESIGN OF FUTURE GREEN BUILDING MATERIALS.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIVERSITY; SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIVERSITY","139164","HNTCHEN@SJTU.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139164","Y5WD0","1879-1786","OCT 2023",NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [52278265]; SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF JILIN PROVINCE [20220203080SF]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, GRANT NO. 52278265 AND THE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF JILIN PROVINCE (20220203080SF) .",NA,"0959-6526","J.

UNDERSTANDING PCB ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS VERSUS TRADITIONAL BUILDINGS COULD REINFORCE RELEVANT POLICIES AND ADOPTION. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A HOLISTIC LIFE-CYCLE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM BASED ON BIM TECHNOLOGY TO CALCULATE CARBON EMISSIONS OF PCB ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY, AND VERIFY THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY SAVING AND EMISSION REDUCTION. EXISTING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL DATABANKS ALLOWED THE COMPILATION OF CARBON EMISSION FACTORS. FIVE REPRESENTATIVE RESIDENTIAL PCB PROJECTS WERE ENLISTED TO CALCULATE CARBON FOOTPRINTS IN SIX INDIVIDUAL LIFE-CYCLE CONSTRUCTION STAGES. IN MOST STAGES, CARBON EMISSIONS WERE REDUCED WITH AN INCREASING PREFABRICATION RATE. IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE STAGE, CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 91\% OF THE TOTAL, AND THE BUILDING MATERIALS PRODUCTION STAGE ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 11\%. THE ``NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSION `` IN THE DEMOLITION AND RECYCLING STAGE WAS ABOUT-4\%. CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE REMAINING THREE STAGES WERE MINIMAL AT ABOUT < 2\%. THIS STUDY ESTABLISHED THE WHOLE LIFE-CYCLE CARBON-EMISSION INDICES OF RESIDENTIAL PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION PER UNIT AREA AT AROUND 105.88 KGCO(2)/(M(2).A), AND COMPUTED VALUES FOR INDIVIDUAL BUILDING STAGES. FOR COMPARISON, A COMPLETELY CAST-IN-PLACE BUILDING WAS STUDIED, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION PER UNIT AREA AT AROUND 130.79 KGCO(2)/(M(2).A), SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PCB. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTED TO KNOWLEDGE BY FURNISHING THE HOLISTIC CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATION METHOD AND ESTABLISHING THE EMPIRICAL PATTERNS AND TRENDS OF CARBON EMISSIONS OF PCB. THE FINDINGS COULD INFORM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS' CARBON-EMISSION CONTROL AND ACHIEVE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY'S GREEN AND LOW-CARBON GOALS. (C) 2022 ELSEVIER B.V.

HOWEVER, THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IS HUGE, AND THE TRADITIONAL PROJECT PROCESS MANAGEMENT CAUSES A WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) IS WIDELY USED IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY, BUT ALSO CAN BE USED IN THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO IMPROVE THE PROJECT EFFICIENCY. SWOT ANALYSIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ASSIST THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENTERPRISES BY ANALYZING THEIR STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHORS USE SWOT ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE BIM APPLICATION ACROSS THE WHOLE LIFECYCLE OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND TO PROVIDE ADVICE FOR THEIR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ACCORDINGLY. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH BIM CAN SAVE TIME, MONEY AND RESOURCES, FACILITATE MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE, AND HAS A WIDE APPLICATION PROSPECT, THERE ARE STILL SOME TECHNICAL AND NORMATIVE PROBLEMS. INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES, INFORMATION AGGREGATION AND FUSION, AND NEW REGULATIONS TO DEAL WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL THE PROBLEMS TO BE RESOLVED.","PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, SOUTH HOLLAND, NETHERLANDS","XI'AN JIAOTONG-LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL",NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW","2024-12-23",NA,"BR4MP",NA,NA,"PAPADIKIS, K AND CHIN, CS AND GALOBARDES, I AND GONG, G AND GUO, F","XI'AN JIAOTONG -LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY [RDF-17-02-60]","THE MATERIALS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER ARE A PART OF RDF-17-02-60 PROJECT SPONSORED BY XI'AN JIAOTONG -LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY.","978-1-003-00071-6; 978-0-367-43019-1",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW","ENGLISH",NA,"2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS \& STRUCTURES (ICSBS), XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 25-27, 2019","38",NA,NA,"SCHAEFER, DIRK/0000-0002-5695-9312","XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN; XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, INST SUSTAINABLE MAT \& ENVIRONM; UNIV HONG KONG; CHINESE RES INST CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT","351-359","CRC PRESS-BALKEMA","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENGINEERING","SCHAEFER, DIRK/I-9806-2018",NA,1,"SWOT ANALYSIS FOR USING BIM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE WHOLE LIFECYCLE OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000651804300061","0","2",NA,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2020,"LI Z;GUO F;SCHAEFER D","LI, Z (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW","XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV;XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV;UNIV LIVERPOOL","XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV",NA,"LI Z, 2020, SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW","LI Z, 2020, SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES: BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW",NA

BUT FOR DATA-DRIVEN TECHNIQUES, INPUTS AS KEY FACTORS IN PREDICTION ACCURACY, LEARNING EFFICIENCY AND GENERALIZATION CAPACITY, DID NOT PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION. EXISTING RESEARCH FOCUSED ONLY ON PREDICTION ACCURACY BY COPYING PREVIOUS PRACTICES IN OTHER FIELDS LIKE MEDICINE AND HYDROLOGY, WITHOUT CONSIDERING PREDICTION HORIZONS AND ECONOMIC COSTS, WHICH IS MEANINGLESS AND EVEN MAY MISLEAD THE CONFIGURATION OF THE MONITORING SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE-SPACE BUILDINGS WITH LONG-SPAN SPACE, DIVERSE ZONES AND COUPLING PARAMETERS. IN THIS WORK, A NOVEL HYBRID FEATURE SELECTION TECHNIQUE FOR INDOOR TEMPERATURE PREDICTION WAS DEVELOPED. HEREIN, TRANSFER ENTROPY (TE) WAS INTRODUCED INTO FILTER TO EVALUATE IMPORTANCE OF FEATURES, WHERE MAX-MIN TE AS A GAUGE WAS DEFINED TO COPE WITH TIME DELAYS IN HVAC SYSTEM; THEN GATED RECURRENT NETWORK WAS TAKEN IN WRAPPER AS A BRIDGE TO TRANSFORM EVALUATIONS IN FILTER INTO CONTRIBUTIONS TO PREDICTION; LASTLY, LIFE CYCLE COST WAS EMPLOYED AS A REFEREE TO JUDGE COST-EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE WAS VALIDATED BY TIME-SERIES DATA COLLECTED FROM A LIBRARY AND SYSTEM ENERGY CONSUMPTION BASELINE SIMULATED WITH TRNSYS TO SUGGEST OPTIMAL FEATURE SUBSETS UNDER DIFFERENT PREDICTION HORIZONS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","DALIAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","110722","ZJLDLUT@DLUT.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110722","R3KF1","1873-684X","AUG 2023",NA,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM, MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA [51978120]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [2020RT04]; DALIAN KEY FIELD INNOVATION TEAM PROJECT [DUT20TD113]; SPECIAL PROJECT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND INNOVATION TEAM OF DALIAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY [DUT20TD113]; AIRPORT TERMINAL WISDOM ENVIRONMENT SECURITY AND ENERGY SAVING LABORATORY OF GUANGDONG AIRPORT BAIYUN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

THIS IS NOTABLY CRUCIAL DURING INITIAL INVESTMENT PLANNING AND THROUGHOUT PROJECT EXECUTION, FACILITATING EFFICIENT ENGINEERING INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, PRACTICE, QUALITY ASSURANCE, AND COST CONTROL CONCURRENTLY. BIM CONTRIBUTES NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO GREEN BUILDING DEVELOPMENT WHILE POSING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. THE COMPLEXITY OF OPTIMIZING MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS USING BIM HAS HINDERED ITS WIDESPREAD ADOPTION IN DESIGN PRACTICE, CONFINING ITS APPLICATION PRIMARILY TO ACADEMIC RESEARCH. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER REVIEWED 168 PREVIOUS STUDIES FROM THE PAST TEN YEARS, CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH REVIEW AND COMPARISON, AND PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION FOR BIM RESEARCH. SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWS THE APPLICATION OF BIM IN DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, RETROFIT AND DEMOLITION, AND ALL THE ASSESSMENT PHASES OF GREEN BUILDINGS, AND DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES OF THE BIM APPLICATION IN GREEN BUILDINGS AS WELL AS AN ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH GAPS. THIS RESEARCH ENHANCES PRACTITIONERS' UNDERSTANDING OF BIM AND GREEN BUILDINGS' CURRENT TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENT STATUS.

A TOTAL OF THIRTY-FOUR DESIGN VARIABLES WERE CONSIDERED AS THE OPTIMIZATION VARIABLES. THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS CONSISTS OF FOUR STEPS. FIRSTLY, MONTE CARLO METHOD WAS USED TO GENERATE A SET OF DESIGN SAMPLES, AND THE LCC AND INDOOR DISCOMFORT DEGREE HOUR WERE OBTAINED THROUGH COMPUTER SIMULATION. SECONDLY, STEPWISE LINEAR REGRESSION (SLR) AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) MODELS WERE DEVELOPED AS THE PREDICTION MODELS. ANN MODELS EXHIBITED BETTER PREDICTION PERFORMANCE WITH ERRORS OF LESS THAN 6\%. THIRDLY, SIX OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS WERE SELECTED TO COUPLE WITH THE ANN MODELS FOR DESIGN OPTIMIZATION AND THE STRENGTH PARETO EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM II (SPEA II) PRESENTED THE BEST PERFORMANCE. FINALLY, OPTIMIZATION WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF DESIGN VARIABLES WERE CONDUCTED BY USING THE SPEA II ALGORITHM.

HIGH-QUALITY ENERGY ASSESSMENT PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DEVELOPING THESE STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ACCURATELY ASSESSING ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON A NATIONAL SCALE CAN BE CHALLENGING DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS AND NUMEROUS POTENTIAL INFLUENCING FACTORS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE INTERNAL INTERACTION MECHANISM AMONG ENERGY-RELATED FACTORS FROM A MACRO PERSPECTIVE TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION ASSESSMENT. A NATIONAL-LEVEL INTEGRATED DYNAMIC ENERGY ASSESSMENT (IDEA) MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO REVEAL THE POTENTIAL LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS IN THE MACRO ENERGY SYSTEM THROUGH SYSTEM DYNAMICS AND THE LEAST SQUARES METHOD, AND MEANWHILE TO QUANTIFY THE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN CHINA FROM 2000 TO 2020 ACCORDINGLY. RESULTS SHOW 1) THE FIVE ENERGY-RELATED SUBSYSTEMS (POPULATION, ECONOMY, BUILDING, ENERGY, AND ENVIRONMENT) ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AT LEAST TWICE. 2) THERE ARE STRONG CONNECTIONS AMONG THEM, AS EVIDENCED BY MULTIVARIATE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR REGRESSION EQUATIONS; 3) LIFE CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BUILDINGS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS FROM 192.86 M TCE TO 1131.07 M TEE, AND THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR IS OPERATIONAL ENERGY (45\%), FOLLOWED BY EMBODIED ENERGY (33\%) AND MOBILE ENERGY (22\%) IN 2020. 4) THE DISCREPANCIES IN END-USES OF THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY INDICATE MARKED CHANGES IN OCCUPANTS' ENERGY-USE BEHAVIOURS IN RECENT YEARS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES NOT ONLY A MORE PRECISE INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING NATIONAL-LEVEL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BUT ALSO DETAILED LIFE CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INTERNAL INTERCONNECTION RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN ASSIST CHINA'S ENERGY POLICYMAKING AND SERVE AS A REFERENCE FOR OTHER NATIONS.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY","113354","VIVIANWYTAM@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113354","O8SD0","1872-6178","JUL 2023",NA,"AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ARC); AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT [DP190100559]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ARC) , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT (NO: DP190100559) .",NA,"0378-7788","ENERGY BUILD.","ENERGY AND BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","OCT 1",NA,"42",NA,"HYBRID","LIU, LEI/0000-0001-8556-6297 ALMEIDA, LAURA/0000-0002-4228-2187 TAM, VIVIAN/0000-0002-1074-8018",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY \& FUELS; ENGINEERING",NA,NA,9,"DYNAMICALLY ASSESSING LIFE CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BUILDINGS AT A NATIONAL SCALE BY 2020: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN CHINA","ARTICLE","WOS001046450300001","5","27","296","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY \& FUELS; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"LIU LEI;TAM VIVIAN W Y;ALMEIDA LAURA;LE KHOA N","TAM, VWY (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), WESTERN SYDNEY UNIV, SCH ENGN DESIGN \& BUILT ENVIRONM, LOCKED BAG 1797, PENRITH, NSW 2751, AUSTRALIA","ISI","ENERGY BUILD","WESTERN SYDNEY UNIV;WESTERN SYDNEY UNIV","WESTERN SYDNEY UNIV",NA,"LIU L, 2023, ENERGY BUILD","LIU L, 2023, ENERGY BUILD",NA

THE NEW APPROACH, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RESOURCE LOOP, HAS THE CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE BOTH C2G AND C2C LIFECYCLES OF MOST PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR POLICIES. THE C2C LCA MODEL REPRESENTS THE FOOTPRINT OF A PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY THAT NEVER ENDS (I.E., RECYCLED OR REUSED). IT REFLECTS THE FOOTPRINT OF A PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY THAT TERMINATES AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE (I.E., DISPOSED OR LANDFILLED). IN THIS PAPER, MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOW ANALYSIS (MEFA) IS INTEGRATED INTO THE C2C LCA MODEL TO ENHANCE THE MODEL'S CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE AND INTEGRATE MATERIAL AND ENERGY INFORMATION INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OF LCA. THE FLOWS ARE RELABELED ``LEAKS'' AND ``FEEDS'' OF WHICH THE MATERIAL AND ENERGY COULD LEAK OUT OF OR FEED INTO THE LIFE CYCLE SYSTEM. THE ``LEAKS'' AND ``FEEDS'' REFLECT THE FLOWS OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY IN AND OUT OF THE LIFE CYCLE PROCESS. THEY CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH THE LIFE CYCLES OF OTHER PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY. SUCH INTEGRATION IS A STEP CLOSER TOWARD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LCA MODEL FOR A FINISHED PRODUCT THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOWS (E.G., A BUILDING). RESOURCE LOOP (RL) REFLECTS THE MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOWS AND LOOPS OF ONE OR MORE COMPLEX SYSTEMS MORE ACCURATELY. THE RL INCORPORATES LEAKS AND FEEDS THAT REFLECT THE REALITY OF A PRODUCT'S LIFECYCLE. THROUGH DATA COLLECTED FROM SELECTED SOURCES, THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE USE OF THE CONSTRUCTION STEEL RL.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS IN BUILDING MODELS AND ANALYZE THEIR IMPACT ON CARBON EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO FIND THE BEST ADAPTATION METHOD THAT COMBINES ECONOMY AND CARBON REDUCTION. THROUGH A CARBON EMISSIONS CALCULATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF REPLACING PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS ON A LARGE PUBLIC BUILDING IN ZHENJIANG, CHINA, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT AFTER REPLACING GLASS CURTAIN WALLS WITH PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS, THE CARBON EMISSIONS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATION STAGE DECREASED BY 30.74\%, BUT THE CARBON EMISSIONS DURING THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION STAGE OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED BY 10.48\%. THE CARBON EMISSIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE BUILDING HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY 20.99\%. THIS INDICATES THAT PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALL TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE BUILDING CARBON EMISSIONS. FURTHER PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND SALES ROUTES FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS AND ACCELERATING THE IMPROVEMENT OF CARBON TRADING SYSTEMS CAN FURTHER IMPROVE THE CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION EFFECT OF BUILDINGS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRACTICAL REFERENCE FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN SIMILAR AREAS AND GUIDANCE FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE FUTURE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","NANJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY; NANJING NORMAL UNIVERSITY","7030","211947036@NJNU.EDU.CN CHANGQILIU@NJNU.EDU.CN XIEHAO@NJNU.EDU.CN 791515273@163.COM ZC499447614@163.COM 221912078@NJNU.EDU.CN CSBU@NJNU.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/en16207030","W2GE4","1996-1073",NA,NA,"NATURAL SCIENCE RESEARCH OF JIANGSU HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF CHINA [22KJB480006]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE RESEARCH OF JIANGSU HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF CHINA (22KJB480006).",NA,NA,"ENERGIES","ENERGIES","ENGLISH","OCT",NA,"49","20","GOLD","CHANGQI, LIU/0000-0001-6959-2161",NA,NA,"MDPI","ENERGY \& FUELS","XIE, HAO/KWU-8636-2024 ZHAO, ZHONG/GQZ-8913-2022 ",NA,3,"ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS REPLACING GLASS CURTAIN WALLS ON THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS BASED ON BIM MODELING STUDY","ARTICLE","WOS001089858600001","22","49","16","ENERGY \& FUELS","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"LIU MEIJING;LIU CHANGQI;XIE HAO;ZHAO ZHONGHUI;ZHU; CHONG;LU YANGANG;BU CHANGSHENG","LIU, CQ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NANJING NORMAL UNIV, ENGN LAB ENERGY SYST PROC CONVERS \& EMISS CONTROL, SCH ENERGY \& MECH ENGN, NANJING 210023, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","ENERGIES","NANJING NORMAL UNIV;NANJING NORMAL UNIV;NANJING NORMAL UNIV","NANJING NORMAL UNIV",NA,"LIU M, 2023, ENERGIES","LIU M, 2023, ENERGIES",NA

IN THIS CONTEXT DECISION MAKERS NEED TOOLS TO MEASURE AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF URBAN WATER SYSTEMS (UWS) AND THEIR RELATED SCENARIOS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A VERSATILE MODEL, NAMED WALA (WATER SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT), WHICH REDUCES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE UWS WHILE ENSURING A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF WATER ISSUES AND FULFILLING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) REQUIREMENTS. INDEED, LCAS REQUIRE BUILDING UWS MODELS, WHICH CAN BE TEDIOUS IF SEVERAL SCENARIOS ARE TO BE COMPARED. THE WALA MODEL IS BASED ON A FRAMEWORK THAT USES A ``GENERIC COMPONENT'' REPRESENTING ALTERNATELY WATER TECHNOLOGY UNITS AND WATER USERS, WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED WATER FLOWS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACTS DUE TO WATER DEPRIVATION, EMISSIONS, OPERATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE. UWS SCENARIOS CAN BE BUILT BY INTER-OPERATING AND CONNECTING THE TECHNOLOGIES AND USERS COMPONENTS IN A MODULAR AND INTEGRATED WAY. THE MODEL CALCULATES LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS AT A MONTHLY TEMPORAL RESOLUTION FOR A SET OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO USERS, AS DEFINED BY THE SCENARIO. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE RATIO OF IMPACTS TO AMOUNT OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND USEFUL INFORMATION FOR UWS DIAGNOSIS OR COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED IN A MATLAB/SIMULINK INTERFACE THANKS TO OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE MODEL IS DEMONSTRATED USING A VIRTUAL CASE STUDY BASED ON AVAILABLE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATA. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

HOWEVER, MANY PPPS IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH CONTROVERSY AS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT COST AND SCHEDULE OVERRUNS DURING CONSTRUCTION. CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF PPP PROJECTS IS EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT/EVALUATION. YET, CONVENTIONAL EX-POST EVALUATION THAT SOLELY FOCUSES ON MEETING BUDGET AND A PREDETERMINED SCHEDULE ARE INVARIABLY APPLIED TO MEASURE PPPS IN PRACTICE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT LITERATURE USED TO EVALUATE PPP PROJECTS AND PROPOSES THAT A LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH TO THEIR EVALUATION IS NEEDED TO `FUTURE PROOF' THEIR PERFORMANCE AND ENSURE VALUE FOR MONEY THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF PPPS IS TO MAXIMISE PROFITABILITY, THERE IS A NEED TO AMELIORATE THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE, END-USERS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THIS CAN BE ENABLED THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AS IT NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ASSET, BUT ALSO PROVIDES KEY DECISION MAKERS WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ACROSS A PROJECT'S LIFE-CYCLE. WHEN ALIGNED WITH A SERIES OF CORE INDICATORS THAT ARE USED FOR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT BIM CAN ACT AS A CATALYST FOR `FUTURE PROOFING' PPPS AND ENABLE THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF AN ASSET THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE-CYCLE.

THESE HARMS ARE TRANSLATED AND REVEALED INTO THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON (SCC), BUT ASSESSING THE BUILDING SCC CONSIDERING PROTECTION OBJECTS IS STILL DIFFICULT DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE AND RAPID TOOLS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A METHOD BASED ON OPENBIM TO CALCULATE THE SCC THROUGH THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. THIS METHOD REFLECTS THE CAUSE-EFFECT CHAINS OF CARBON EMISSIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH, ECOSYSTEM QUALITY, AND SOCIAL ASSETS UNDER LIME, EPS, AND RECIPE APPROACHES. AN ORIGINAL TOOL, NMBIM, IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THIS PROPOSED METHOD, WHICH CALCULATES THE SCC OF A CASE BUILDING BY DIRECTLY IMPORTING INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC) FILES. THE CASE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MAXIMUM LIFE CYCLE SCC REACHES 5872.4 RMB/M2, WHICH EXCEEDS THE CONSTRUCTION COST.

ALTHOUGH MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES SHED LIGHT ON THE CALCULATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS, A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK IS STILL MISSING. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK OF CARBON EMISSIONS BASED ON BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR STEPS: (1) DEFINING THE BOUNDARY OF CARBON EMISSIONS IN A LIFE CYCLE; (2) ESTABLISHING A CARBON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS DATABASE FOR CHINESE BUILDINGS AND ADOPTING REVIT, GTJ2018, AND GREEN BUILDING STUDIO FOR INVENTORY ANALYSIS; (3) CALCULATING CARBON EMISSIONS AT EACH STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE; AND (4) EXPLAINING THE CALCULATION RESULTS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. THE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED IS VALIDATED USING A CASE STUDY OF A HOSPITAL PROJECT, WHICH IS LOCATED IN AREAS IN ANHUI, CHINA WITH A HOT SUMMER AND A COLD WINTER. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE REINFORCED CONCRETE ENGINEERING CONTRIBUTES TO THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS (AROUND 49.64\%) IN THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE, AND THE HVAC (HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING) GENERATES THE LARGEST PROPORTION (AROUND 53.63\%) IN THE OPERATIONAL STAGE.

HOWEVER, ONLY A FEW LIFE CYCLE INVENTORIES (LCIS) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WITH PREVAILING BOUNDARIES AND SCOPES WHICH PREVENT THEM FROM BEING APPLIED DIRECTLY TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION. THEREFORE UTILIZATIONS OF OVERSEAS LCI WITH VALID MODIFICATION HAVE BECOME AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO EXPAND THE USAGE OF EXISTING LCI AS WELL AS TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH A LOCALIZED INVENTORY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK WHICH MAKES USE OF NON LOCAL LCI DATA AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF LOCAL CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS-SPECIFICALLY, TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE ``CRADLE TO SITE'' PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. FRAMEWORK INPUTS, OUTPUTS AND DATA CONVERSION METHODS ARE ANALYSED IN A DETAILED MANNER. A CASE STUDY IN SINGAPORE WHICH FOCUSES ON CARBON EMISSIONS GENERATED FROM CEMENT PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION IS EMPLOYED TO SHOWCASE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IN LCA PRACTICE. THE RESULT OBTAINED WAS COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL BENCHMARK TO VALIDATE THE FRAMEWORK'S PERFORMANCE. THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF ERROR WAS 2\%, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ONE FROM RAW LCI OF 14\%. DISCUSSION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REGARDING TO THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF UNCERTAINTY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED. THE RESULT CAN EXPAND THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE OF CROSS-BOUNDARY LCI USAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE NET-ZERO AMBITION URGES THE NEED TO RENOVATE BUILDING ENERGY SYSTEM IN VIEW OF THE LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMAL, TO ADDRESS CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. EXISTING RETROFITTING AND OPTIMISATION SOLUTIONS ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON MINIMISING OPERATIONAL ENERGY OR COST. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH BUILDING RETROFITTING CAN REDUCE THE ENERGY USE AT THE OPERATING PHASE, ADDITIONAL MATERIALS WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED EMBODIED ENERGY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEVISE A NOVEL BUILDING RETROFITTING APPROACH THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMISATION AND SUPPLY-SIDE MANAGEMENT. IT IS AN INTERACTIVE TWO-SET OPTIMISATION APPROACH AIMED AT MINIMISING OVERALL LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION THROUGH DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL DESIGN CONFIGURATION AND OPERATING PLAN OF RETROFITTING ENERGY DEVICES. THE ESSENTIAL RETROFITTING ENERGY DEVICES INCLUDE PASSIVE RETROFITTING OPTIONS (I.E., PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL AND SOLAR THERMAL COLLECTOR) AND ACTIVE RETROFITTING OPTIONS (I.E., BIOMASS BOILER, GROUND SOURCE HEAT PUMP, HEAT STORAGE, ELECTRICITY STORAGE, AND COGENERATION SYSTEM). A MODERN 3-FLOOR OFFICE BUILDING IN MANCHESTER, THE UNITED KINGDOM, IS ADOPTED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED REFURBISHMENT APPROACH. THE REAL-WORLD SITUATION IS REPRESENTED BY HISTORICAL ELECTRICITY AND GAS CONSUMPTION PROFILES, CURRENT BUILDING DESIGN INFORMATION, HISTORICAL WEATHER PROFILE, AS WELL AS LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORY INFORMATION.

THE INNOVATION POINTS INCLUDE BIG-DATA INFORMATION, INTEGRATED RETROFITTING DESIGN, AND LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMISATION THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMY, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT. THE OPTIMAL RETROFITTING PLAN IS SELECTED TO MAXIMISE ITS LIFE-TIME COST-SAVING, ENERGY REDUCTION AND CARBON REDUCTION. THE PROPOSED RETROFITTING OPTIMISATION APPROACH IS TESTED ON A REAL-WORLD BUILDING. THE STANDARD RETROFITTING OPTIONS INCLUDE ROOF INSULATION, WALL INSULATION, WIND TURBINE, SOLAR HEATER, BIOMASS BOILER, COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM AND PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL. THE HISTORICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BUILDING INFORMATION, HISTORICAL WEATHER DATA, AND INVENTORY DATA IS ADOPTED IN THE DATA DRIVEN MODEL TO REPLICATE THE REAL-WORLD CASE. ALTHOUGH BUILDING RETROFITTING WOULD INCREASE ECONOMIC, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS LIFE-CYCLE DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT COST, EMBODIED ENERGY AND CARBON OF RETROFITTING MATERIALS, THE OVERALL LIFE-CYCLE COST, ENERGY AND CARBON WOULD BE LOWER THAN THOSE NON RETROFITTED BUILDINGS. IT IS FOUND THAT ENVELOPE INSULATION HAS THE LOWEST UNIT RETURN COST, ENERGY AND CARBON, FOLLOWED BY THE SOLAR HEATER, COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM, BIOMASS BOILER, WIND TURBINE AND PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL. THROUGH THE OPTIMAL RETROFITTING PLAN, 39\% LIFE-TIME COST-SAVING, 55\% LIFE-TIME ENERGY REDUCTION AND 59\% LIFE-TIME CARBON REDUCTION CAN BE ACHIEVED AT AN INVESTMENT COST OF 1.32 POUND X 10(6).","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF WEST ENGLAND","102934","L.OYEDELE@UWE.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102934","UR8EB","2352-7102","JUL 2021",NA,"DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY \& INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY (BEIS) [TEIF-101-7025]","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND EXPRESS THEIR SINCERE GRATITUDE TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, ENERGY \& INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY (BEIS) THROUGH GRANT PROJECT NUMBER TEIF-101-7025.

GIVEN THAT THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF THE GLOBAL URBAN POPULATION BY 2050 REQUIRES CITIES WITH HIGHER DENSITY AND POTENTIALLY A GREATER NUMBER OF HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS, IT IS CRUCIAL TO DEVELOP A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EMBODIED CARBON AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS. THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL MATERIALS USED IN HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS ARE REINFORCED CONCRETE AND STRUCTURAL STEEL. AS OF TODAY, OVER 99\% OF TALL BUILDINGS' STRUCTURES ARE BUILT FROM THOSE TWO MATERIALS. THIS ARTICLE UTILIZES A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM)-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IN REVIT AND TALLY TO EXAMINE THE EMBODIED CARBON AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF AN ACTUAL HIGH-RISE BUILDING STRUCTURE CASE STUDY IN CHICAGO THAT USES A HYBRID CONCRETE STEEL STRUCTURE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EMBODIED CARBON AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE HIGH-RISE BUILDING STRUCTURE ARE DOMINATED BY THE IMPACTS OF THE PRODUCT STAGE IN THE BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE AND BY CONCRETE BEING THE MAIN STRUCTURAL MATERIAL. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT CONCRETE CONSTITUTES A SUBSTANTIAL 91\% SHARE OF THE TOTAL MASS OF THE BUILDING STRUCTURE, WITH A 74\% CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIFE CYCLE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, 53\% TO THE ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, 74\% TO THE EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL, 74\% TO THE SMOG FORMATION POTENTIAL, AND 68\% TO THE NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY USAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, STEEL ACCOUNTS FOR 9\% OF THE BUILDING'S STRUCTURE MASS, ESTIMATED TO CONSTITUTE 26\% OF THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, 47\% OF THE ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, 26\% OF THE EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL, 26\% OF THE SMOG FORMATION POTENTIAL, AND 32\% OF THE NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY USAGE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY","569","LMA34@IIT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su16020569","GE8M2","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JAN",NA,"33","2","GOLD","AZARI, RAHMAN/0000-0002-4844-639X",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","AZARI, RAHMAN/AFJ-8858-2022 ",NA,1,"A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF THE EMBODIED CARBON AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HIGH-RISE BUILDING STRUCTURES: A CASE STUDY","ARTICLE","WOS001151081100001","13","21","16","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2024,"MA LIJIAN;AZARI RAHMAN;ELNIMEIRI MAHJOUB","MA, LJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), IIT, COLL ARCHITECTURE, CHICAGO, IL 60616 USA","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","COLL ARCHITECTURE;COLL ARCHITECTURE;PENN STATE UNIV","COLL ARCHITECTURE",NA,"MA L, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY","MA L, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

ALTHOUGH IT HAS A WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON THE INDUSTRY, THE SYSTEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION OF BIM IN PROJECTS FACES CHALLENGES. THIS STUDY INTEGRATED BIM INTO THE LIFECYCLE OF A BUILDING PROJECT WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK CONSTITUTED BY BIM INFORMATION FLOW, BIM MODEL CHAIN, BIM WORKFLOW, BIM INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, AND BIM-BASED PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS). THIS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIES THE KEY AREAS FOR INTEGRATING BIM INTO THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE AND EXPLAINS HOW BIM WORKS FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. THROUGH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACTION RESEARCH APPROACH, THE STUDY DEVELOPED A BIM ROADMAP FOR THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE BY SYSTEMATICALLY IMPLEMENTING BIM IN THE BUILDING PROJECT. THE MAJOR FINDINGS AND PIECES OF EVIDENCE DERIVED VIA THE IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS EXPLAIN HOW BIM DISRUPTS THE PROJECT FROM THE VIEW OF ORGANIZATION DESIGN AND CLARIFY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY IN PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS BIM ADOPTION AND INTEGRATION.

METHODS PROPOSED BY THESE STUDIES USUALLY REQUIRE NOT ONLY SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING MODEL, BUT ALSO DETAILED INVENTORY DATA, WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE AT EARLY DESIGN STAGE. SEEING THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN PHASE TO CARBON EMISSIONS DURING BUILDING'S LIFECYCLE, A STUDY ON REGRESSION MODEL OF CARBON EMISSIONS USING DESIGNING FACTORS WAS DONE. FIRSTLY, BASED ON PROCESS ANALYSIS METHOD, THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF 207 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN TIANJIN WERE CALCULATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ANNUAL CARBON EMISSIONS PER FLOOR AREA ARE BETWEEN 30 AND 60 KGCO(2)/(M(2).YEAR), WITH MANUFACTURE PHASE AND OPERATION PHASE ACCOUNTING FOR 11\%-25\% AND 75\%-87\%, RESPECTIVELY. THEN, CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND ELASTIC NET WERE USED TO DETERMINE 12 DESIGNING FACTORS FOR PREDICTIVE MODEL; AT LAST, FOUR REGRESSION TECHNIQUES, PCR, RF, MLP AND SVR WERE USED TO DEVELOP REGRESSION MODELS, RESPECTIVELY; COMPARISON AND PROCESS ANALYSIS OF MODEL DEVELOPMENT WERE GIVEN LATER. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SVR HAS THE OPTIMAL PREDICTIVE ACCURACY AMONG FOUR MODELS, ITS CORRESPONDING COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION CAN REACH TO 0.800. THIS REGRESSION MODEL CAN BE UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE CARBON EMISSIONS BASED ON DESIGNING FACTORS, WHICH CAN HELP DESIGNERS MAKE A STRATEGIC DECISION AT EARLY STAGE. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK HELPS IN IMPLEMENTING A STOCHASTIC LIFE-CYCLE COST (LCC) MODEL FOR BUILDING TO SELECT THE OPTIMUM BUILDING MATERIALS ALTERNATIVES AND DISCOVER THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BUILDING SYSTEM IN EACH COST ELEMENT STARTING FROM INITIAL COST TO END ON LIFE COST. GENETIC ALGORITHMS OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE IS UTILIZED TO SELECT THE OPTIMUM ALTERNATIVES OF BUILDING SYSTEMS TAKING IN CONSIDERATION SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS. THE MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION MODEL IS USED AS A FITNESS FUNCTION FOR THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT OF BUILDING IS ACHIEVED BY CONSIDERING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS THAT CAN BE AWARDED UNDER THE LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) RATING SYSTEM. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ON THE OPTIMUM SOLUTIONS THAT ARE CHOSEN BY OPTIMIZATION A MODEL TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT BUILDING SYSTEMS ON LCC AND ITS COMPONENTS THROUGH COMPUTING THE RANK ORDER OF BUILDING SYSTEMS AND THE TARGET OUTPUT.

HOWEVER, THE BURDENS OF RENOVATION INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION ARE MOSTLY OVERLOOKED, LEADING TO POTENTIAL OVERESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) PROVIDES A HOLISTIC ESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, BUT FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ARE NEEDED TO CORRECTLY CONSIDER SPATIO-TEMPORAL ASPECTS.

TEMPORAL ASPECTS ARE CONSIDERED BOTH IN THE LIFECYCLE INVENTORY AND THE LIFECYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT PHASES, BY ACCOUNTING FOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND APPLYING TIME-ADJUSTED CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATION. WE APPLY THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING RENOVATION IN ESCH-SUR-ALZETTE (LUXEMBOURG). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RENOVATION STAGE REPRESENTS 4\%-16\% OF THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN THE RESIDUAL SERVICE LIFE OF EXISTING BUILDINGS, RESPECTIVELY AFTER CONVENTIONAL OR ADVANCED RENOVATIONS. UNDER CURRENT RENOVATION RATES, THE CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION WOULD BE LIMITED TO 3-4\% BY 2030. PUSHING RENOVATION RATES TO 3\%, ENABLES CARBON REDUCTIONS UP TO 28\% BY 2030 WHEN COMBINED WITH ADVANCED RENOVATIONS. CARBON REDUCTIONS IN THE OPERATIONAL STAGE OF BUILDINGS ARE OFFSET BY 8-9\% DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF RENOVATION. USING TIME-ADJUSTED EMISSIONS RESULTS IN HIGHER WEIGHT FOR THE RENOVATION STAGE AND SLIGHTLY LOWER BENEFITS FOR RENOVATION.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR APPLIED SYSTEMS ANALYSIS (IIASA)","109834","MASTRUCC@IIASA.AC.AT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.rser.2020.109834","LO1ZK","1879-0690",NA,NA,"POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH PROJECT ``DAEDALUS'' - NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND, LUXEMBOURG (FNR) [AFR-7579115]; LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","THIS STUDY HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH PROJECT ``DAEDALUS'' SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND, LUXEMBOURG (FNR) [GRANT AGREEMENTS AFR-7579115] AND THE LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.",NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

AT THE CITY SCALE, A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE ENERGY POLICIES. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO ASSESS BUILDING RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; HOWEVER, ITS EXTENSION TO THE URBAN SCALE IS STILL HAMPERED BY SEVERAL OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. COUPLING LCA AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PROMISING SOLUTION BUT DEVELOPMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN AUTOMATED APPROACH FOR THE ENERGY MODELLING AND LCA OF URBAN HOUSING STOCKS BASED ON GIS. THE MAIN STEPS OF THE APPROACH ARE THE FOLLOWING: (I) GIS-BASED BUILDING STOCK CHARACTERIZATION; (II) AUTOMATED BUILDING-BY-BUILDING ENERGY ANALYSIS; (III) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CALCULATION VIA LCA. THE APPROACH WAS APPLIED TO THE TEST CASE CITY ESCH-SUR-ALZETTE (LUXEMBOURG) TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION DRIVEN BY HOUSING RETROFITTING. RESULTS WERE PROVIDED BUILDING-BY-BUILDING AND DISPLAYED AS MAPS FOR IMPROVED COMMUNICATION. AN ENERGY SAVINGS POTENTIAL OF 35.3\% AND A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) REDUCTION OF 30.8\% WERE CALCULATED AS RESULTS OF RETROFITTING. THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RETROFITTING STAGE ON THE RESIDUAL LIFE OF THE BUILDING STOCK IS 4 TO 10\% OF THE GWP, DEPENDING ON THE BUILDING TYPE. THE STUDY PROVIDED ONE OF THE FIRST MODELS ABLE TO PERFORM A FULLY-FLEDGED LCA OF BUILDINGS AT THE URBAN SCALE IN A BOTTOM-UP FASHION.

THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDES: GEOSPATIAL PROCESSING OF BUILDING-RELATED DATA TO CHARACTERIZE URBAN BUILDING STOCKS; A SPATIO-TEMPORAL DATABASE TO STORE AND MANAGE DATA; LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE METHODOLOGY WAS TESTED FOR A CASE STUDY IN LUXEMBOURG AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS REGARDING THE RETROFITTING STAGE OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WERE PROVIDED FOR ONE ENTIRE CITY. THE DATA MODEL IS PART OF A WIDER BOTTOM-UP FRAMEWORK BEING DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT DECISION ABOUT BUILDING STOCK RETROFITTING FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING.","29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE","LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY",NA,"ALESSIO.MASTRUCCI@LIST.LU",NA,"PROCEEDINGS OF ENVIROINFO AND ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 2015","2024-12-23",NA,"BD9PC",NA,NA,"JOHANNSEN, VK AND JENSEN, S AND WOHLGEMUTH, V AND PREIST, C AND ERIKSSON, E",NA,NA,"978-94-62520-92-9","2352-538X",NA,"PROCEEDINGS OF ENVIROINFO AND ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 2015","ENGLISH",NA,"JOINT CONFERENCE ON 29TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION / 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY (ENVIROINFO AND ICT4S), UNIV COPENHAGEN, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, SEP 07-09, 2015","34",NA,NA,"MARVUGLIA, ANTONINO/0000-0002-8360-8040","EUROPEAN ENVIRONM AGCY","47-56","ATLANTIS PRESS","COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","MASTRUCCI, ALESSIO/AGL-2326-2022 LEOPOLD, ULRICH/F-9714-2010 BENETTO, ENRICO/H-3234-2012 MARVUGLIA, ANTONINO/AAD-6483-2022","ACSR-ADVANCES IN COMPTUER SCIENCE RESEARCH",19,"GIS-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF URBAN BUILDING STOCKS RETROFITTING A BOTTOM-UP FRAMEWORK APPLIED TO LUXEMBOURG","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000365044700006","0","24","22","COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2015,"MASTRUCCI ALESSIO;POPOVICI EMIL;MARVUGLIA ANTONINO;DE; SOUSA LUIS;BENETTO ENRICO;LEOPOLD ULRICH","MASTRUCCI, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LUXEMBOURG INST SCI \& TECHNOL, ENVIRONM RES \& INNOVAT ERIN DEPT, 41 RUE BRILL, L-4422 BELVAUX, LUXEMBOURG","ISI","PROCEEDINGS OF ENVIROINFO AND ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 2015","LUXEMBOURG INST SCI AND TECHNOL;LUXEMBOURG INST SCI AND TECHNOL","LUXEMBOURG INST SCI AND TECHNOL",NA,"MASTRUCCI A, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF ENVIROINFO AND ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 2015","MASTRUCCI A, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF ENVIROINFO AND ICT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 2015",NA

UPON LITERATURE AND PRACTICE RESEARCH, WE DISCOVERED THAT BIM ONTOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY DEFINED DURING PROJECT LIFE CYCLE ON THE WHOLE. THERE ARE VARIOUS EXISTING INTERPRETATIONS OF BIM AND RELATED ACRONYMS, BUT THESE INTERPRETATIONS ONLY DESCRIBE BIM FROM A SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVE REGARDLESS TO GENERAL RELATIONSHIPS. THIS CAN RESULT IN PROBLEMS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS DURING COMMUNICATION, COORDINATION AND CONTRACTING. RESEARCH SHOWS, THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BIM IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS: 1) BIM AS A PRODUCT, 2) BIM AS A METHOD AND 3) BIM AS A METHODOLOGY. THIS PAPER ALSO EXPLORES BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF BIM AS A METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSES THE CORRECT BIM ONTOLOGY WE USE SCHEMATICS, AND EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF BIM IN TRADITIONAL PROJECT LIFE CYCLE PHASES. WE PROPOSE STRICT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MODEL AND MODELING, AND WE DESCRIBE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIM AND OTHER IM (I.E. PIM, PLIM, CIM, DIM AND AIM). PROPOSED ONTOLOGY OUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN BOTH RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. IN BIM STANDARDIZATION PROCESS, BIM IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEVELOPMENT OF BIM RELATED TOOLS, IT IS NECESSARY THAT ALL PARTIES UNDERSTAND COMMON ONTOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY. IN THE END, THE PAPER ALSO SUMMARIZES THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH RESULTS AND THEIR POSSIBLE USE IN PRACTICE. (C) 2017 THE AUTHORS.

SEVERAL FRAMEWORKS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE TO CALCULATE THE FOOTPRINT OF BUILDINGS, INCLUDING STANDARDS AND NORMS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), AND DEDICATED SOFTWARE TOOLS. THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PROGRAMME FOR THESE CALCULATIONS IS BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED AND VERY PRACTICAL. THIS SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION FOCUSES ON THE APPLICATION OF A BIM-BASED RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO ANALYSE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE. THE RESEARCH PROCESS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING STEPS: (I) THE DESIGN OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE WITH MASONRY CONSTRUCTION USING ARCHICAD 26, BIM PROGRAMME, (II) SIMULATION OF THE BUILDING ENERGY PERFORMANCE USING THE ECODESIGNER STAR PLUG-IN, (III) LCA USING THE PLUG-IN FOR ARCHICAD, (IV) PREPARATION OF A SECOND MODEL WITH TIMBER-FRAME CONSTRUCTION FOR COMPARISON, AND (V) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE MODELS WITH MASONRY CONSTRUCTION (BUILDING A) AND TIMBER-FRAME (BUILDING B). ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CO2E EMISSIONS BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND THE VARYING IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS ON THE TOTAL CO2E EMISSIONS OF THE BUILDINGS STUDIED. BUILDING A HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET EMISSIONS, AMOUNTING TO 43,226.94 KG CO2E, IN STARK CONTRAST TO BUILDING B'S SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER 13,522.13 KG CO2E. THIS DISCREPANCY WAS ALSO MIRRORED IN THE EMISSION INTENSITY, WITH BUILDING A EMITTING AT A RATE OF 281.06 KG CO2E/M2 COMPARED TO BUILDING B'S 96.72 KG CO2E/M2. THESE FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT FOR FUTURE WORK ON SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION AIMING TO MINIMISE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE GOAL OF MINIMISING THE CUMULATIVE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF BUILDINGS IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"15486","ARCH.LUKASZMAZUR@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su152115486","X7SA7","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","NOV",NA,"89","21","GOLD","MAZUR, LUKASZ KAMIL/0000-0002-3799-4446",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","MAZUR, LUKASZ KAMIL/ABF-1210-2021",NA,5,"LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING INTEGRATED APPROACH: CARBON FOOTPRINT OF MASONRY AND TIMBER-FRAME CONSTRUCTIONS IN SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES","ARTICLE","WOS001100391500001","9","31","15","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2023,"MAZUR LUKASZ;OLENCHUK ANATOLII","MAZUR, L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), HELENA CHODKOWSKA UNIV TECHNOL \& ECON, FAC ENGN, JAGIELLONSKA 82F, PL-03301 WARSAW, POLAND","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","HELENA CHODKOWSKA UNIV TECHNOL AND ECON;HELENA CHODKOWSKA UNIV TECHNOL AND ECON","HELENA CHODKOWSKA UNIV TECHNOL AND ECON",NA,"MAZUR L, 2023, SUSTAINABILITY","MAZUR L, 2023, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A MIX OF EXPLORATORY AND DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH METHODS WAS USED TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK FROM 179 ROLE-PLAYERS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PHASES OF THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING LIFECYCLE (RBLC) IN NEW ZEALAND. EMPIRICAL DATA WERE ANALYSED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, MULTI-ATTRIBUTE METHOD AND FRIEDMAN'S TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. FINDINGS - RESULTS SHOWED THAT DESIGNERS, BUILDING OWNERS, MAIN CONTRACTORS AND PROJECT MANAGERS WERE THE GREATEST INFLUENCERS OF THE PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES IN THE RBLC. THE PRIORITY DRIVERS OF THESE KEY ROLE-PLAYERS' INFLUENCES ON THE RBLC PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES COMPRISED POOR BRIEF INTERPRETATION, INCLINATION TO LOWEST TENDER, INADEQUATE PRIOR RISK ANALYSIS AND MISCOMMUNICATION OF OWNER'S REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS, RESPECTIVELY. BY TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO REDRESS THEIR PRODUCTIVITY INHIBITING ACTS/OMISSIONS AS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY, THE VARIOUS ROLE-PLAYERS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES IN THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INTERVIEW ALL PARTICIPANTS THAT MADE UP THE REPRESENTATIVE RANDOM SAMPLES FROM EACH ROLE-PLAYER GROUP DUE LARGELY TO WORKLOAD RELATED EXCUSES. AS A RESULT, THE FINDINGS AND THE CONCLUSIONS MAY NOT BE GENERALISED BEYOND THE STUDY SCOPE. HOWEVER, THE STUDY ACHIEVED ITS PURPOSE, AS THE MAIN INTENT WAS TO PROVIDE HYPOTHETICAL CONSTRUCTS THAT COULD GUIDE FURTHER CONFIRMATORY/EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AS WELL AS FOR OTHER BUILDING TYPES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - A SUCCINCT AND EASY-TO-FOLLOW MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AS IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAY FOR OPERATIONALISING THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY IN THE INDUSTRY. THE MODEL HIGHLIGHTS THE OWNER-ARCHITECT-CONTRACTOR INFLUENCE TRIANGLE (OACIT) AS THE 20 PER CENT OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT COULD DELIVER 80 PER CENT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT IN THE RBLC. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY RE-EXAMINES PRODUCTIVITY ISSUES NOT ONLY FROM A LIFE-CYCLE PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE KEY ROLE-PLAYERS. IN ADDITION, THE OACIT CONCEPT OFFERS A NOVEL PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT TOOL; IT STRESSES THAT PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TRADITIONALLY PROCURED BUILDING LIFECYCLE COULD BE OPTIMISED IF THE ARCHITECT COULD FOCUS GREATER ATTENTION ON BRIEF ARTICULATION AND THE ISSUANCE AND REVIEW OF DESIGN AND SPECIFICATION INFORMATION.

THE RETROFIT WAS COMPLETED TO A PASSIVHAUS STANDARD WHILE THE NEW BUILD WAS COMPLETED TO CURRENT IRISH BUILDING REGULATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE RETROFIT AND NEW BUILD WAS MEASURED USING LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENTS, EXAMINING THE ASSEMBLY, OPERATIONAL AND END-OF-LIFE STAGE OVER LIFE SPANS OF 50 AND 80 YEARS. USING PRIMARY INFORMATION, LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE AND LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT DATABASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EACH STAGE WERE MODELLED. THE OPERATIONAL STAGE OF BOTH CASE STUDIES WAS FOUND TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, FOLLOWED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE END-OF-LIFE STAGE RESPECTIVELY. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND END-OF-LIFE STAGE DECREASED AS THE LIFE SPAN INCREASED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RETROFIT HOUSE STUDIED OUTPERFORMED THE NEW BUILD IN THE ASSEMBLY AND OPERATIONAL STAGE, WHEREAS THE NEW BUILD PERFORMED BETTER IN THE END-OF-LIFE STAGE; HOWEVER, THIS IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE, DEPENDING ON THE STANDARDS TO WHICH BOTH ARE COMPLETED.

IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT OFFERS THE LARGEST AND LEAST COST GHG MITIGATION OPTION OF ANY SECTOR OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY (IPCC 2007). SCIENCE-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO ANALYSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR LCA-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION MAKING FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE, COMPARES IT TO THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LCA TOOLS AND DATA BASES, AND IDENTIFIES THE ``NEXT STEPS'' IN DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE LCA STANDARD FOR ASSESSING WHOLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLES TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION MAKING IN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: 1) CSU/AIA CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS IN 8 US CITIES TO EXPLORE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL USE OF LCA IN DECISION MAKING BY ARCHITECTS; 2) A FRAMEWORK CREATED BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM FOCUS GROUPS, 3) THE FRAMEWORK WAS COMPARED TO EXISTING LCA TOOLS AND DATABASES, 4) GAPS WERE IDENTIFIED FOR NEXT STAGES IN DEVELOPING AN LCA-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION-MAKING TOOL FOR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN. FINDINGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: 1) CURRENT LCA TOOLS ARE BALKANIZED AND USUALLY ADDRESS ONLY ONE LIFE CYCLE STAGE, MATERIAL OR SYSTEM IN A BUILDING. 2) LCA-RELATED DATABASES NORMALLY ONLY ADDRESS MATERIALS AND PRODUCT; THEY DO NOT ADDRESS CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES OR BUILDING OPERATIONS. 3) LCA TOOLS AND DATABASES GENERALLY REQUIRE A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ACTIVITY, DATA INPUT AND EXPERTISE; THEY ARE NOT INTEGRATED INTO ROUTINELY USED ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) TOOLS, METHODS OR BEST PRACTICES. 4) LCA BASED DECISION-MAKING WILL NOT BECOME AN AEC BEST PRACTICE UNTIL IT IS FULLY INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, STANDARDIZED, AFFORDABLE, AND DEMANDED BY CUSTOMERS AND MUNICIPALITIES.

A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THROUGH THE USE OF REDESIGNED 3D PRINTED PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTION PHASE IS OFTEN MISSING. DESPITE THE WIDE DIFFUSION OF STEREOLITHOGRAPHY, RELIABLE AND UPDATED DATA QUANTIFYING IMPACTS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IN PARTICULAR, THIS KIND OF INFORMATION IS LACKING FOR DESKTOP-SCALE STEREOLITHOGRAPHY, WHOSE MARKET IS INCREASING RAPIDLY. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A CRADLE-TO-GATE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF BOTTOM-UP DESKTOP STEREOLITHOGRAPHY. THE ANALYSED SYSTEM INCLUDES THE PHASES OF MATERIAL PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, TRANSFORMATION AND POST-PROCESSING. THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF THE ASSESSMENT REGARDS ONE PRINTED PART. TO EFFICIENTLY QUANTIFY THE ACTUAL IMPACTS, THE STUDY INTRODUCES AS PARAMETERS THE MASS OF THE PRODUCT TO BE MANUFACTURED, THE MASS OF ITS SUPPORTING STRUCTURES AND THE BUILDING TIME. THIS PARAMETRISATION ALLOWS FOR AN EASY INTEGRATION OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION FOR AN EXTENDED CRADLE-TO-GRAVE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF THE MANUFACTURED PART. THE LIFE-CYCLE MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR A BOTTOM-UP DESKTOP STEREOLITHOGRAPHY APPARATUS LOCATED IN ITALY. ANALYSES AND EVALUATIONS OF THE ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT LIFE-CYCLE PHASES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A SPECIFIC CASE STUDY. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD.

HENCE, IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK ABOUT A FAST WAY TO DETERMINE THE LCC VALUES. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN LCC DEEP LEARNING PREDICTION MODEL TO ASSESS STRUCTURAL AND ENVELOPE-TYPE ALTERNATIVES FOR INDUSTRIAL BUILDING, AND TO MAKE A DECISION FOR THE MOST SUITABLE STRUCTURE. THE INPUT AND OUTPUT CRITERIA OF THE PREDICTION MODEL WERE COLLECTED FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES. THE DEEP LEARNING NETWORK MODEL WAS DEVELOPED USING A DEEP BELIEF NETWORK (DBN) WITH RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINE (RBM) HIDDEN LAYERS. SEVEN INVESTIGATION CASES WERE STUDIED TO VALIDATE THE PREDICTION MODEL OF A 312-ITEM DATASET OVER A PERIOD OF 30 YEARS, AFTER THE TRAINING PHASE OF THE NETWORK TO TAKE THE SUITABLE HIDDEN LAYERS OF THE RBM AND HIDDEN NEURONS IN EACH HIDDEN LAYER THAT ACHIEVED THE MINIMAL ERRORS OF THE MODEL.

THIS RESEARCH ASSUMES THAT MANAGING THE FACTORS OF CONSTRUCTION WASTE WILL INEVITABLY REDUCE ITS QUANTITY DURING THE CLC USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LEAN DESIGN. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF TWO TECHNIQUES (DESIGNING OUT WASTE AND DESIGN STRATEGIES) BASED ON QUALITATIVE FACTORS USING THE BIM/LEAN DESIGN CONCEPTS IN THE DESIGN PHASE WHICH COULD REDUCE CONSTRUCTION WASTE IN THE CLC OF INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, THE RESEARCH PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS OF CONSTRUCTION WASTE USING SYSTEM DYNAMICS. A MODEL WAS PROPOSED THAT SERVES AS A DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL TO ENSURE CONSTRUCTION WASTE REDUCTION IN THE CLC. THE MODEL IN THIS STUDY INCLUDES EIGHT CAUSAL LOOP DIAGRAMS GIVING THE PROFESSIONALS BETTER UNDERSTANDING FOR THE OBJECTIVES TO REDUCE CONSTRUCTION WASTE. THIS MODEL HAS BEEN PROCESSED USING ANYLOGIC SOFTWARE WITH A STOCK-FLOW DIAGRAM TO CREATE THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL. FINALLY, THE VALIDATION AND IMPLEMENTATION ARE DEMONSTRATED USING A CASE STUDY FOR THE SUGGESTED MODEL. THE CASE STUDY'S FINDINGS IMPROVED THE MODEL'S CONFIDENCE IN ORDER TO UTILIZE IT FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. IT HAS BEEN FURTHER ASSESSED FOR ITS IMPACT IN TWO PROPOSED SCENARIOS TO REDUCE CONSTRUCTION WASTE.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A LITERATURE REVIEW ON THE GAP BETWEEN THE USES OF BIM IN DESIGN AND FM HAS BEEN DONE. THE KEY PROFESSIONAL GROUPS OF FM IN THE PREMISES CENTRE OF THE CITY OF HELSINKI WERE INTERVIEWED ON THE INFORMATION TOOLS THEY USE, AND THE NEEDS AND IMPEDIMENTS OF THE BIM IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FM. CULTURAL-HISTORICAL ACTIVITY THEORY IS USED AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. FINDINGS - THE LITERATURE DISCUSSING THE BIM IMPLEMENTATION TENDS TO OMIT THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING FM INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE TOOLS IN USE. THE CHALLENGE IN THE BIM IMPLEMENTATION IS IN WHICH WAYS THE RELEVANT INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE BIM MODELS COULD BE INTEGRATED WITH THESE SYSTEMS. NO WELL-ARTICULATED PROBLEMS OR DEVELOPMENTAL CONTRADICTIONS CAME UP THAT WOULD DEMAND THE INVESTMENT IN THE BIM IMPLEMENTATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS CALL FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION OF BIM IN DIFFERENT FM ACTIVITIES AND IN THE FM INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURES IN USE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER STUDIES EMPIRICALLY DIFFERENT FM ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS USED BY THE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS. SUCH STUDIES ARE NEEDED FOR A REALISTIC VIEW OF THE POTENTIAL INTEGRATION OF THE BIM INFORMATION TO THE FM INFORMATION SYSTEMS.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI",NA,"REIJO.MIETTINEN@HELSINKI.FI",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/JFM-04-2017-0017","FT9XX","1741-0983",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1472-5967","J.

THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS INFORMATION MODELS OF A COMPLETE LIFE PROJECT IN THE SECTOR OF ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO OPTIMIZE BIM TECHNOLOGIES BY BUILDING A MODEL BASED ON A DISCRETE VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION. RESULTS. ANALYZED THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO THE WIDESPREAD INTRODUCTION OF BIM TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE PRACTICE OF THE CONSTRUCTION COMPLEX OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PROJECT, INCLUDING THE STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND DISPOSAL, AS WELL AS GLOBAL TRENDS IN THIS PROCESS. THE METHOD OF BIM DIMENSION REDUCTION BASED ON DISCRETE VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION IS FORMULATED. THE TECHNOLOGY OF FORMING A HIERARCHICAL DYNAMICALLY ADDED AND UPDATED INFORMATION BASE BIM, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS AGGREGATION, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE ALGORITHMS PROPOSED IN THIS WORK ARE IMPLEMENTED IN THE SHELL OF A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. CONCLUSIONS. BIM DIMENSION REDUCTION, BASED ON A DISCRETE VECTOR DESCRIPTION OF DATA, ALLOWS YOU TO COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF BOTH DESIGNING AND UPDATING THE BIM INFORMATION BASE, AND ITS TRANSFER BETWEEN PROJECT PARTICIPANTS. BIM DATA FORMATS ARE DETERMINED BY THE STAGE OF THE COMPLETE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE. FULLY FUNCTIONAL FOR THE STAGE OF DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF WORK ON A PROJECT, BIM IS ONE-DIMENSIONAL AND IS SIMPLY DETERMINED BY THE VECTOR OF CLUSTERS OF A LOWER DEGREE OF INTEGRATION, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO COMPLETELY OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES TO THE WIDESPREAD INTRODUCTION OF BIM TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT INTO PRACTICE.

THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY SAVINGS IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN CYPRUS THROUGH OPTIMISING BUILDING ENVELOPES AND INSULATION MATERIALS. USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING AND ENERGY MODELLING SOFTWARE, THE STUDY ANALYSES 120 COMBINATIONS OF BUILDING ENVELOPES AND EIGHT INSULATION MATERIALS, IDENTIFYING AN OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF WALL, ROOF, AND FLOORING MATERIALS THAT COULD RESULT IN 32\% ENERGY LOAD REDUCTIONS AND 27\% LOWER LIFE-CYCLE COSTS COMPARED TO THE MEDIAN SCENARIO. HIGH-DENSITY ROCK WOOL INSULATION ON ROOFS AND DOUBLE-GLAZED WINDOWS WERE ALSO FOUND TO OFFER BOTH MONETARY AND ENERGY PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CURRENT HIGH ENERGY PRICES COULD PROVIDE GREATER ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO ADOPT THESE OPTIMISATION STRATEGIES.

DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE BUILDING SECTOR ACCOUNTS FOR 39\% OF THESE EMISSIONS. REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF BUILDINGS, OR EMBODIED CARBON (EC), WILL PREVENT GHG EMISSIONS FROM ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE EARLIER, REDUCING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE ANY MEANINGFUL REDUCTION, THERE IS A NEED FOR CONSISTENCY AND ACCURACY IN THE CALCULATIONS. THE ACCURACY OF THESE CALCULATIONS IS PRIMARILY TIED TO THE ACCURACY OF EMBODIED CARBON FACTORS (ECF) USED IN THE CALCULATIONS, VALUES DETERMINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF A PRODUCT OR PROCEDURE PER UNIT WEIGHT. THE EMISSIONS OF ANY PRODUCT CAN BE CALCULATED BY PERFORMING A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). WHILE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT AN LCA HAVE BEEN STANDARDISED IN ISO14044, THE LACK OF A DEFINITIVE NATIONAL ECF DATABASE IN THE UK MEANS THAT EC CALCULATIONS CAN VARY DRASTICALLY BASED ON THE CHOSEN DATABASE. AN LCA HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON A STANDARD LIDL SUPERMARKET DESIGN WITHIN THE A1-A3 BOUNDARY. FOR THE CALCULATION, THE ECFS WERE SOURCED FROM TWO DIFFERENT DATABASES, USING THE GHG CONVERSION FACTOR DATA PUBLISHED IN 2020 BY THE UK DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY \& CLIMATE CHANGE AND DATA PUBLISHED IN 2019 BY THE INVENTORY OF CARBON AND ENERGY (ICE). THE LATTER IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED AS THE MOST CONSISTENT DATABASE FOR CARBON FACTORS IN THE UK. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT USING A MORE DETAILED DATABASE COMPARED TO USING A MORE GENERAL DATABASE COULD RESULT IN A 35.2\% REDUCTION OF EMBODIED CARBON, WHILE USING MORE DETAILED DATA FROM A SINGLE DATABASE CAN REDUCE IT BY A FURTHER 5.5\%. IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE MOST ACCURATE BASELINE FOR EMBODIED CARBON SO THAT ANY CARBON REDUCTION ATTEMPTS CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF WEST LONDON","7988","21460515@STUDENT.UWL.AC.UK ALI.BAHADORI-JAHROMI@UWL.AC.UK MARCO.FERRI@LIDL.CO.UK AMYLONA@CIBSE.ORG",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su13147988","TO8FW","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JUL",NA,"23","14","GOLD, GREEN ACCEPTED","MOHEBBI, GOLNAZ/0000-0002-4575-8355",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","B-JAHROMI, ALI/J-5934-2018 ",NA,14,"THE ROLE OF EMBODIED CARBON DATABASES IN THE ACCURACY OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CALCULATIONS FOR THE EMBODIED CARBON OF BUILDINGS","ARTICLE","WOS000677141100001","4","60","13","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"MOHEBBI GOLNAZ;BAHADORI-JAHROMI ALI;FERRI MARCO;MYLONA; ANASTASIA","BAHADORI-JAHROMI, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV WEST LONDON, SCH COMP \& ENGN, DEPT CIVIL ENGN \& BUILT ENVIRONM, LONDON W5 5RF, ENGLAND","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","UNIV WEST LONDON;UNIV WEST LONDON;CHARTERED INST BLDG SERV ENGINEERS CIBSE","UNIV WEST LONDON",NA,"MOHEBBI G, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY","MOHEBBI G, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

THE PRIMARY AIM IS TO IDENTIFY NONCONFORMANCES THAT ESCALATE OPERATIONAL COSTS AND TO EVALUATE HOW BIM CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THESE COSTS. THE RESEARCH BEGINS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE AND UTILIZES THE DELPHI METHOD TO IDENTIFY FOUR KEY NONCONFORMANCES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. TO FURTHER ANALYZE THESE ISSUES, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND THE NON-DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II (NSGA-II) ARE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE COST RANGES OF COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NONCONFORMANCES IN BOTH THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONAL PHASES. THE STUDY FINDS THAT BIM-BASED OPTIMIZATION CAN LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL COST REDUCTIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LIMITATIONS DUE TO THE LACK OF PRECISE DATA ON THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF LOW-COST EQUIPMENT. THE KEY CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS DESIGNERS CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE BIM MODELS, ENHANCING FACILITIES MANAGEMENT (FM) AND REDUCING LCC. THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS STUDY LIES IN ITS INTEGRATED APPROACH, COMBINING BIM AND OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS OPERATIONAL COST ISSUES, WHICH PROVIDES A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE ON IMPROVING LIFE CYCLE COST MANAGEMENT IN BUILDINGS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXPAND THE DATASET AND EXPLORE A BROADER RANGE OF NONCONFORMANCES TO REFINE AND EXTEND THE FRAMEWORK'S APPLICABILITY.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TEHRAN","111126","MRD.BAHRAM@GMAIL.COM ESMATULLAH.NOORZAI1980@GMAIL.COM SAMAN.ABBASI1989@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2024.111126","L8U1A","2352-7102",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

ENERGY RENOVATION PROJECTS OF EXISTING BUILDINGS CAN SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BY LEADING, AT THE SAME TIME, TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ADVANTAGES. IN THIS PAPER, THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING METHODOLOGIES WERE USED IN A COMBINED PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY, I.E., THE ENERGY RENOVATION PROJECT OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE IN NORWAY. SEVERAL SCENARIOS BASED ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES WERE ANALYZED, AND LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS WERE COMPUTED, I.E., GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND (CED), AND NET PRESENT COST (NPC). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THE CLOSE TO NEGATIVE LINEAR REGRESSION BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS COMPUTED.

IMPROPER INDOOR TEMPERATURE NOT ONLY DECREASES THE LEVEL OF OCCUPANT THERMAL SATISFACTION, BUT ALSO HAS SERIOUS HEALTH RELATED CONSEQUENCES. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF OCCUPANT THERMAL SATISFACTION THAT HAS BEEN VASTLY EMPHASIZED, STUDIES INCORPORATING OCCUPANTS' SATISFACTION DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-OBJECTIVE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION MODEL TO MINIMIZE LIFE CYCLE COST AND LIFE CYCLE EMISSION, AND MAXIMIZE OCCUPANT SATISFACTION LEVEL IN A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING. TO SOLVE THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM, A HARMONY SEARCH BASED ALGORITHM IS DEVELOPED AND EMPLOYED. MOREOVER, TO IDENTIFY THE LEVEL OF DESIGN THERMAL SATISFACTION, A NOVEL UTILITY THEORY BASED THERMAL COMFORT INDEX IS DEFINED AND CALCULATED. A SMALL OFFICE BUILDING IS SELECTED AS A CASE STUDY TO ANALYZE FOUR DIFFERENT DESIGNS WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED AS OPTIMUM SOLUTIONS. TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM DESIGNS, THE SATISFACTION LEVEL OF ALL THE DESIGN COMBINATIONS HAVING COST AND EMISSIONS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUSLY DISTINGUISHED OPTIMUM SOLUTIONS ARE COMPARED AND BEST DESIGNS ARE IDENTIFIED.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION, 6D-BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM), AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS' ENERGY EFFICIENCY THROUGH APPLYING ENERGY RETROFIT MEASURES. THIS FRAMEWORK AIMS TO (1) INTEGRATE LIFE CYCLE COST, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ANALYSIS (2) IDENTIFY ENERGY-EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES FOR BUILDINGS' ENERGY RETROFIT (3) MAKE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR DECISION-MAKERS AND INVESTORS (4) DISCOVER THE PRIMARY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AGENTS THAT IMPOSE THE MOST ENERGY WASTE ON EXISTING BUILDINGS. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE BY APPLYING EFFECTIVE RETROFIT MEASURES AND ALTERNATIVE MATERIAL CHOICE AND EMPOWERS DECISION-MAKING BY ANALYZING LIFE CYCLE COST AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING ENVELOPES BY COMBINING MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION, BIM, AND LCA. THE BIM ENERGY MODEL COMPARES THE COOLING AND HEATING LOADS OF THE BUILDING'S COMPONENTS BEFORE AND AFTER APPLYING RETROFITTING MEASURES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INEFFICIENT BUILDINGS' ENVELOPES AND EVAPORATIVE COOLERS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION. A DEVELOPED MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION MODEL ESTIMATES THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST OF A BUILDING DURING ITS LIFETIME. MOREOVER, IT PROVIDES AN OPTIMUM ENERGY RETROFITTING SCENARIO THAT LEADS TO REDUCTIONS OF 24\%-58.2\% IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION. IN CONCLUSION, THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT COMPARISON BETWEEN THE BUILDING BEFORE AND AFTER RETROFITTED MEASURES DEMONSTRATES THAT OVER 45\% OF GLOBAL WARMING IMPACTS COULD BE REDUCED IN THE WELL-ESTABLISHED BUILDING.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TEHRAN; MONASH UNIVERSITY","104022","MAEDE.MOTALEBI@UT.AC.IR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104022","ZY7RE","2352-7102","JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

APPLICATIONS ARE MAINLY DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC LIFECYCLE STAGE OF THE FACILITY AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF ONLY ONE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE COST AND THE LABOR FOR ADDING AND REMOVING TAGS AND ELIMINATE THE CHANCE OF USING SHARED RESOURCES. IN THIS PAPER, THE USAGE OF TAGS PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO COMPONENTS IS PROPOSED WHERE THE MEMORY OF THE TAGS IS USED DURING THE LIFECYCLE BY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS FOR DATA STORAGE AND HANDOVER. A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) DATABASE IS USED FOR TACKLING THE INTEROPERABILITY ISSUES ALLOWING DIFFERENT USERS TO ACCESS AND SHARE THE DATA. TO SECURELY AND EFFICIENTLY STORE DATA ON RFID TAGS IN IFCXML FORMAT, MULTI-LEVEL ENCRYPTION TOGETHER WITH ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL IS APPLIED ON THE DATA STORED ON RFID TAGS. EACH USER IS ASSIGNED A CERTAIN ROLE AND CAN ONLY ACCESS THE PART OF DATA FOR WHICH HE HAS AUTHORIZATION ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED ROLE AND THE ACCESS CONTROL POLICY. TO EXPLORE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH, A CASE STUDY CONSIDERING BOTH FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED AT CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE CRUCIAL TOOLS THAT AIDS IN EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF CONSTRUCTION EMISSIONS. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF THE INITIAL AND RECURRENT EMBODIED EMISSIONS, OPERATING AND REUSE/DISPOSAL EMISSIONS, AND UTILIZING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) FOR A MORE HOLISTIC LIFE CYCLE APPROACH. THE RESEARCH PROPOSES A PARAMETRIC BIM-BASED LCA FRAMEWORK FOR QUANTIFYING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF MATERIAL SELECTION FOR BOTH EMBODIED AND OPERATING EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION, IT CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENT REUSE SCENARIOS AND PERCENTAGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON BOTH THE EMBODIED AND OPERATING IMPACTS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAIN MODULES: DATA ACQUISITION MODULE, OPERATING AND EMBODIED EMISSIONS MODULE, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODULE, OPTIMIZATION MODULE, AND DECISION-MAKING MODULE. THIS PARAMETRIC ASSESSMENT CAN BE APPLIED FOR BOTH THE CONVENTIONAL AND CIRCULAR APPROACH IMPACTS. FOR THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, THE RESULTING EMISSIONS ARE OPTIMIZED UTILIZING THE NON-DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II (NSGA-II) AND EVALUATED THROUGH AN LCA AND DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) METHODOLOGY FOR THE MATERIAL SELECTION. A CASE STUDY OF A RESIDENTIAL VILLA IN CAIRO IS WORKED OUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. THIS ASSESSMENT ANALYZES THE BUILDING MATERIALS' CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFICIENCY INVESTIGATING THE EXTERNAL WALLS, INTERNAL WALLS, FLOORS, ROOFS, AND WINDOWS DESIGN POSSIBILITIES, AND USES VISUAL PROGRAMMING TO CONTROL THE RESULTING EMISSIONS FOR A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH. BY COMPARING THE INTEGRATED LCA AND DEA MODELS THREE OPTIMUM DESIGN SOLUTIONS, THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH DEVELOPS DESIGN SOLUTIONS OF HIGHER EMBODIED GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) THAN THE CIRCULAR APPROACH. HOWEVER, IT DEVELOPS LOWER OPERATING GWP WITH BETTER APPLIED U-VALUES. THE CIRCULARITY APPROACH EMPLOYMENT HAS REDUCED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OPERATING GWP DUE TO UTILIZING MATERIALS WITH HIGH HEAT TRANSMITTANCE ABILITY.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CAIRO; EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); CAIRO UNIVERSITY","106898","MMARZOUK@CU.EDU.EG",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106898","L3AP6","2352-7102","MAY 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

HOWEVER, UNILATERAL DESIGN CHOICES BASED SOLELY ON REDUCING OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE A BUILDING'S EMBODIED ENERGY AND LIFE CYCLE ENERGY USE AS THERE IS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL ENERGY. TO SUPPORT SUCH TRADE-OFF PROBLEMS, MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION REPRESENTS A USEFUL APPROACH THAT PRODUCES A SET OF OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS FROM WHERE A SOLUTION CAN THEN BE SELECTED AND PROGRESSED WITHIN THE DESIGN PROCESS. SELECTING ONE SOLUTION FROM THE SET OF OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS CAN HOWEVER BE A CHALLENGING TASK AS EACH SOLUTION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE CHOSEN AS THE OPTIMUM. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW SOLUTIONS FROM A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION APPROACH CAN BE ANALYZED FURTHER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO DECISION-MAKERS WHEN SELECTING THE OPTIMAL DESIGN SOLUTION. AN APPROACH IS PROPOSED WHERE THE INTEGRATION OF POST-OPTIMIZATION SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS INTO A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION APPROACH AIMS TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKERS IN ANALYZING THE OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS. THE APPLICABILITY OF APPROACH IS DEMONSTRATED USING A CASE OF A MULTIFAMILY APARTMENT BUILDING LOCATED IN SWEDEN, WHERE THE AFOREMENTIONED TRADE-OFF IS EXPLORED FOR A SET OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES. THEREBY, A DIVERSE RANGE OF OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN UP TO 4520 GJ LIFE CYCLE ENERGY (LCE) SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THE CASE BUILDING'S INITIAL DESIGN WAS INI-TIALLY IDENTIFIED USING THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION. THESE SOLUTIONS WERE THEN SUBJECTED TO A SENSI-TIVITY ANALYSIS WHERE THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT IN GENERAL THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST SENSITIVITY IN TERMS OF LCE USE BELONGED TO THE INSULATION THICKNESSES IN ROOF AND WALLS, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE THICK-NESS OF EXTERIOR FLOOR INSULATION YIELDED THE GREATEST VARIATION IN THE SENSITIVITY. THE FINDINGS OF CASE STUDY INDICATE THAT THE POST-OPTIMIZATION SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CAN ADD VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT COMPLEMENTS THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION APPROACH. CONSEQUENTLY, IT CAN SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING ON HOW TO PROGRESS WITH THE DESIGN IN TERMS OF WHAT DESIGN PARAMETERS HAVE A NEGLIGI-BLE OR SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OBJECTIVES WHEN THEY ARE VARIED, THUS FACILITATING PRIORITIZATION.

MOVING TOWARDS ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS IS A KEY FACTOR TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY. A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING, AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO ENHANCE THE OPERATING ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE RESULTING BUILDING DESIGNS ADOPTED, ALONG WITH REDUCING THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING, IN TERMS OF COST OF CONSTRUCTION, IS DEVELOPED. THE FRAMEWORK ACCOMMODATES VARIOUS PARAMETERS, VIA INTEGRATING MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION PROGRAMMING, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING, AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO IMPROVE THE BUILDING PERFORMANCE, IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE SUSTAINABLE DESIGNS, AND EMPOWER THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THROUGH THE DEVELOPED OPTIMIZATION MODEL, THE EXAMINATION OF VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR BUILDING COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE ENVELOPE OF A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS UNDERTAKEN. INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL COMPONENTS OF BUILDING ENVELOPES INFLUENCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS, PARTICULARLY, EXTERIOR WALLS AND WINDOWS. IMPACTS IN TERMS OF ANNUAL ENERGY USE INTENSITY CAN BE REDUCED BY ABOUT 45\%, LIFE CYCLE ENERGY USE AND COST CAN BE ENHANCED BY MORE THAN 50\%, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SUCH AS ACIDIFICATION AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL CAN BE REDUCED BY MORE THAN 30\%, DUE TO USE OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. THIS WORK INDICATES THAT SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DECISIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY OPTIMIZING THE MATERIAL SELECTION AND ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT VIA BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO DE JANEIRO; UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY",NA,"MNAJJAR@POLI.UFRJ.BR KAROLINEFIGUEIREDO@POLI.UFRJ.BR A.HAMMAD@UNSW.EDU.AU ASSED@POLI.UFRJ.BR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.101","IS6EQ","1872-9118",NA,NA,"COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL (CAPES) [001]; CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT)","THIS STUDY WAS FINANCED IN PART BY THE COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL (CAPES) - FINANCE CODE 001, AND CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT).",NA,"0306-2619","APPL.

FURTHERMORE, THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THAT PRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AS IT CONSUMES LARGE AMOUNTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY. AIMING TO INVESTIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY EVALUATES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SHOWING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN EVALUATING MIDPOINT AND ENDPOINT IMPACT CATEGORIES. THIS STUDY REVIEWS LCA FROM A BUILDING PERSPECTIVE AND EMPOWERS THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE NOVELTY IS TO ESTIMATE THE OPERATING ENERGY PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATE THE ENDPOINT IMPACTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS AT AN EARLY DESIGNING STAGE, CONSIDERING TWO METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION AND STEEL CONSTRUCTION. THIS WORK FOLLOWS THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF LCA BASED ON ISO 14040 AND 14044 GUIDELINES WITHIN THE AVAILABLE DATABASE, USING AUTODESK GREEN BUILDING STUDIO APPLICATION IN AUTODESK REVIT AND OPEN LCA SOFTWARE BASED ON TWO ASSESSMENT METHODS: IMPACT 2002+ AND ILCD 2011. A CASE STUDY OF A MULTI-STORY OFFICE BUILDING IS APPLIED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK. THE BUILDING IS STRUCTURED AT FOUR LEVELS OF SUBSYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS: BASIC STRUCTURE, WALLS, FINISHING, AND WINDOWS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT USING STEEL CONSTRUCTION INSTEAD OF CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION IS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IN SUCH TYPES OF BUILDINGS. IT ENCOURAGES THE APPLICATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS TO PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES, REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND PROTECTING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO DE JANEIRO; UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY; WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY",NA,"V.TAM@WESTERNSYDNEY.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15623599.2019.1637098","0L7AC","2331-2327","JUL 2019",NA,"CAPES FOUNDATION (COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL) [001]; CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT)","THE AUTHORS WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM CAPES FOUNDATION (COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL) -FINANCE CODE 001, AND CNPQ (BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT).",NA,"1562-3599","INT.

RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN SUCH INTEGRATED MODELING PROCESSES AND TECHNIQUES HAVE NOT YET PROVIDED RELIABLE AND ROBUST DECISION-MAKING CAPABILITIES FOR DESIGNERS TO INTUITIVELY CHOOSE BETWEEN MATERIAL ALTERNATIVES. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A NEW DESIGN FRAMEWORK THAT INTEGRATES BIM, LCA, AND MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING (MCDM) ALGORITHMS TO FACILITATE SUSTAINABLE DESIGN PROCESSES IN BUILDING PROJECTS. A CASE STUDY USING A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING PROJECT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCE OF CANADA WAS IMPLEMENTED TO TEST THE DESIGNS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING A THREE-WAY COMPARISON OF DESIGN SCENARIOS-CONVENTIONAL HOT-ROLL STEEL, RECYCLED STEEL, AND TIMBER. THE RESULTS INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT WITH THE ADOPTION OF RECYCLED STRUCTURAL STEEL MATERIALS, SURPASSING CONVENTIONAL STEEL DESIGNS AND DEMONSTRATING A SIMILAR PERFORMANCE TO THAT OF TIMBER DESIGNS. THE STUDY UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMED DECISION-MAKING IN MATERIAL SELECTION, DRIVEN BY THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL DESIGNS AND MULTI-CRITERIA EVALUATION (E.G., SOCIAL CARBON COST).

THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A METHOD THAT INTEGRATES BUILDING ENERGY MODELLING (BEM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TOOLS, IES VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (IES VE) AND ONE CLICK LCA, TO CONDUCT A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF THE OPERATIONAL AND EMBODIED CARBON IMPACTS OF A TYPICAL TERRACED BUILDING SHELL IN AN ECO SELF-BUILD COMMUNITY HOUSING (ESBC) PROJECT, USING WATER LILIES AS A CASE STUDY. IT EVALUATES AND COMPARES THE 60-YEAR LIFE CYCLE CARBON IMPACTS OF SIX DESIGN OPTIONS THAT APPLY DIFFERENT INSULATION MATERIALS TO THE CASE STUDY BUILDING SHELL. THE RESULTS ARE BASED ON GRID-CONNECTED FUTURE ENERGY SCENARIOS (FES) THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CARBON INTENSITIES PREDICTED OVER TIME AND THE MICROGRID-CONNECTED WATER LILIES COMMUNITY ENERGY (WLCE) SCENARIO THAT IS OPERATIONALLY NET-ZERO CARBON. DEPENDING ON THE FES, EMBODIED CARBON ACCOUNTED BETWEEN 59 AND 80\% OF TOTAL EMISSIONS COMPARED TO 20-41\% FROM OPERATIONAL CARBON ACROSS DESIGN OPTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OPERATIONAL CARBON IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE PERCENTAGE OF RENEWABLES IN THE ENERGY MIX OF THE GRID, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DESIGN CHOICE. AS SUCH, FUTURE RESEARCHERS SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR PREDICTED CHANGES TO THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE GRID BY APPLYING A SIMILAR METHOD TO THAT PROPOSED. OVERALL, THE INTEGRATION OF IES VE AND ONE CLICK LCA PROVIDED A MORE STREAMLINED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO HELP INFORM EARLY DESIGN DECISIONS BY ENABLING ENERGY CONSUMPTION SIMULATION IN BEM TO ASSESS OPERATIONAL CARBON EMISSIONS AND THE AUTOMATED TRANSFER OF BUILDING MATERIALS FROM THE BEM MODEL TO THE LCA TOOL TO ASSESS EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS. THE LIMITATIONS INCLUDED THE UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIAL-SPECIFIC DATA IN EARLY DESIGN STAGE PLANS, THE INABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER THE TIMBER FRAME STRUCTURE FROM IES VE TO ONE CLICK LCA, AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE ENERGY TRENDS.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL","106356","PABLO.NEWBERRY@BRISTOL.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106356","Q1KF3","2352-7102","MAR 2023",NA,"EPSRC [EP/R513179/1]; BRIGHT GREEN FUTURES THROUGH AN INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDENTSHIP","THIS RESEARCH WAS JOINT FUNDED BY EPSRC AND BRIGHT GREEN FUTURES THROUGH AN INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDENTSHIP.

HOWEVER, EMBODIED CARBON IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED COMPARED TO THE OPERATIONAL PREDICTIVE MODEL DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF COLLECTING EMBODIED DATA. PREVIOUS STUDIES RELIED ON BASIC PARAMETERS (I.E., GFA, STOREY, ETC.) TO QUANTIFY EMBODIED CARBON. THIS APPROACH LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY DUE TO VARIATIONS IN BUILDING MATERIALS. IDENTIFYING MATERIAL-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE MOST EMBODIED EMISSIONS IS CRUCIAL TO ENHANCING THE PREDICTION ACCURACY OF REGRESSION MODELS. TAKING MALAYSIA `S GREEN-CERTIFIED OFFICE BUILDINGS AS A CASE STUDY, THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT-MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION (LCA-MLR) FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH HOTSPOT-ORIENTED REGRESSION MODELS.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE USE OF PCMS FOR ENERGY STORAGE AND PROVIDED SOME LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE EMBODIED ENERGY OF THE PCM; HOWEVER, AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT HAS NOT FULLY BEEN ADDRESSED UNTIL NOW IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PREPARATION OF ORGANIC PCMS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCAS) OF TWO ORGANIC, BIOSOURCED PCMS FOR THEIR APPLICATIONS, FOCUSING ON EMBODIED ENERGY AND CO2 EMISSIONS. DODECANOIC ACID PRODUCED FROM PALM KERNEL OIL WAS CONSIDERED AS A PCM FOR USE IN A SOLAR THERMAL WATER HEATING APPLICATION, AND ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE WAS CONSIDERED FOR THERMAL BUFFERING. THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS WERE DEFINED AS 1 T OF DODECANOIC ACID PCM AND 1 KG OF ENCAPSULATED ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PCM, RESPECTIVELY. THE LCA ENCOMPASSES ALL PHASES IN THE PCM PRODUCTION: GROWTH AND HARVESTING OF THE FEEDSTOCKS, EXTRACTION OF THE OIL, TREATMENT OF THE OIL, AND SEPARATION OF SINGULAR COMPONENTS. THE TWO PCMS WERE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THE PAYBACK TIMES FOR THEIR EMBODIED ENERGIES AND EMBODIED CO2 UNDER A MODELED USE PHASE. THE ENERGY PAYBACK TIME FOR DODECANOIC ACID IN A SOLAR THERMAL APPLICATION WAS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN 2 YEARS. ALTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF DODECANOIC ACID IS A NET CO2 EMITTER, USE OF THIS PCM IN A SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM CAN RECOUP THE CO2 OF PRODUCTION IN LESS THAN A YEAR. ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE, CONSIDERED FOR USE IN A THERMAL BUFFERING WALLBOARD PRODUCT, WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST 30 YEARS OF USE BEFORE ITS ENERGY SAVINGS WOULD MATCH ITS EMBODIED ENERGY, MOSTLY DUE TO THE DRYING STEP IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PCM. HOWEVER, ETHYL HEXADECANOATE IS A STRONG SEQUESTER OF CO2 AT 7.6 T PER TON OF ETHYL HEXADECANOATE. DODECANOIC ACID PRODUCED FROM PALM KERNEL OIL FOR USE IN A SOLAR THERMAL HOT WATER SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE A VIABLE PCM. ITS PAYBACK TIME, BOTH FOR ENERGY AND CARBON EMISSIONS, IS UNDER 3 YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE HIGH EMBODIED ENERGY OF ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE GIVES A PROHIBITIVELY LONG PAYBACK TIME FOR USE IN DOMESTIC THERMAL BUFFERING APPLICATIONS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY; DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY",NA,"MAWHITE@DAL.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-014-0831-1","CA9NA","1614-7502",NA,NA,"NSERC (CANADA); NSERC PGS-M SCHOLARSHIP","THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE SUPPORT OF THIS WORK FROM GRANTS FROM NSERC (CANADA), INCLUDING SCHOLARSHIPS TO J.A.N.

THE CURRENT PRACTICE HAS INVOLVED THE COMBINED USE OF BIM TOOLS (SUCH AS AUTODESK REVIT, AND NAVISWORKS) FOR 3D BUILDING MODELLING, BUILDING ENERGY MODELLING (BEM) TOOLS (SUCH AS ENERGYPLUS AND DOE-2), AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) TOOLS (SUCH AS ATHENA ECO-CALCULATOR, TALLY AND SIMAPRO, ETC.) TO CONDUCT LCA OF BUILDINGS. ONE OF THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OBSERVED IN THIS APPROACH IS THE INTEROPERABILITY (DATA LOSS) ISSUES, AS WELL AS THE COMPLEXITY ARISING FROM EMPLOYING MANY TOOLS ESPECIALLY AT THE EARLY BUILDING DESIGN STAGE. THIS PAPER IS A CRITIQUE OF CONVENTIONAL BIM-INTEGRATED LCA OF BUILDINGS. IT PROPOSES A REAL-TIME BIM-INTEGRATED LCA/LCC THAT ALLOWS THE DESIGNER TO GET IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK (ON ENERGY, CARBON, LCC, AND EXERGY) AT KEY STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS.

IN GENERAL, THERE IS NO GUARANTEED PROCEDURE, NO UNIVERSAL SET OF TOOLS TO HELP BUILD A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ORGANIZATION. IF KNOWLEDGE CREATION IS TO BE USED TO BETTER ACHIEVE RESULTS, IT SHOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

THE ACTUAL IDENTIFICATION IS CONDUCTED BY COMPARING FOUR REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES USING URBAN METABOLISM FUSED WITH LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (UM-LCA) IN COMBINATION WITH INFORMATION RELATING TO COST AND EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPARED TECHNIQUES. THE METHODOLOGICAL GOAL OF OUR PAPER IS TO TEST UM-LCA AS A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL AND DISCUSS APPLICATION OF THE METHOD IN RELATION TO LARGE REFURBISHMENT PROJECTS.METHODSTO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF PCB-REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES, THE UM-LCA METHOD WAS APPLIED. BY COMBINING UM AND LCA METHODOLOGIES, THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT POTENTIALS OF THE REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES WERE CALCULATED. TO BUILD AN INVENTORY FOR EACH TECHNIQUE, WE CONTACTED AND INTERVIEWED EXPERTS AND STUDIED EXISTING LITERATURE, CASES, AND PROJECTS IN ORDER TO COMPILE INFORMATION ON PRACTICAL DETAILS OF THE TECHNIQUES. TO PROCESS THE COLLECTED INVENTORY DATA, WE USED THE SIMPLIFIED PRODUCT SYSTEM MODELING SOFTWARE QUANTIS SUITE 2.0 (QS2.0). IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS FROM THE SIMPLIFIED SOFTWARE, WE CARRIED OUT THE EXACT SAME ANALYSIS USING A MORE COMPLEX TOOLOPENLCA 1.5. BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS, WE COMPARED THE REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES AND IDENTIFIED THE TECHNIQUES WITH THE SMALLEST AND LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT POTENTIALS.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTHE RESULTS OBTAINED ARE PRESENTED, AND THE TECHNIQUE WITH THE SMALLEST IMPACT IDENTIFIED. A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO SOFTWARE TOOLS APPLIED IS MADE, AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. FURTHER DISCUSSED IS HOW POSSIBLE INVENTORY ERRORS AFFECT THE RESULTS AND IF ANY ASSUMPTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS CRITICAL FOR THE FINAL RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, ARE THE REMEDIATION EFFICIENCIES OF EACH TECHNIQUE AND THE COST OF EACH METHOD CONSIDERED AND COMPARED. FINALLY, UM-LCA'S ABILITY TO WORK AS A TOOL FOR DECISION SUPPORT IS DISCUSSED AND POSSIBLE WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING THE METHOD IN SUSTAINABLE DECISION-MAKING IS CONSIDERED.CONCLUSIONSIN THIS STUDY, IT IS FOUND THAT THE MOST ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY PCB-REMEDIATION TECHNIQUE IS THERMAL DESORPTION, WHEREAS THE TECHNIQUE WITH THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT POTENTIAL IS SAND BLASTING, DUE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INDUCED IN RELATION TO DISPOSAL OF THE BUILDING WASTE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE UM-LCA METHOD CAN BE APPLIED AS A TOOL FOR DECISION SUPPORT, AND IF ECONOMIC ASPECTS ARE INCORPORATED, THE UM-LCA APPROACH COULD BE AN ESSENTIAL APPROACH FOR DESIGNING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK; TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK",NA,"S133740@STUDENT.DTU.DK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-018-1445-9","IE2SE","1614-7502",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0948-3349","INT.

ALTHOUGH BIM IMPLEMENTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS LIMITED, MUCH RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON BIM DRIVERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS LESS EVIDENCE TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF BIM BARRIERS AND AWARENESS ON THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES BARRIERS TO BIM IMPLEMENTATION IN BUILDING PROJECTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IT INVESTIGATES THE INFLUENCE OF BIM BARRIERS ON AWARENESS OF BIM DURING THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THUS, A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW IS REQUIRED TO BUILD A CONCEPTUAL MODEL. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) WAS DEVELOPED USING A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY TOOL. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 90 BUILDING EXPERTS IN NIGERIA. THE MODEL'S OUTPUTS HIGHLIGHTED THAT COST AND STANDARDS, PROCESS AND ECONOMIC, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS, AND TRAINING AND PEOPLE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL BARRIERS TO BIM IMPLEMENTATION THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED. FURTHERMORE, THE MODEL PREDICTION REVEALED THAT ELIMINATING BIM BARRIERS HAS A MINOR IMPACT ON SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR POLICY MAKING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CONCERNING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PROJECTS BY AVOIDING BIM BARRIERS; IT WILL LIKEWISE ENHANCE THE SUCCESS OF BUILDING PROJECTS THROUGH BIM.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","VICTORIA UNIVERSITY WELLINGTON; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS; UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA; BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF JOHANNESBURG","108556","A.FAROUK.KINEBER@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108556","0I4TX","1873-684X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

A PLETHORA OF STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE BARRIERS, CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (CSFS), LIFECYCLE AND DRIVERS INDEPENDENTLY, BUT NONE HAVE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF BIM DRIVERS AND AWARENESS ON THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF BIM DRIVERS AND AWARENESS ON THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (SEM). INITIALLY, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FROM AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW. THEREAFTER, THE MODEL WAS TESTED USING PRIMARY QUESTIONNAIRE DATA OBTAINED FROM 90 CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA. EMERGENT FINDINGS INDICATE THAT BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) DRIVERS HAVE A HIGH IMPACT ON BIM AWARENESS AT THE OPERATION STAGE OF THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THE SEM MODEL HAS AN AVERAGE R-2 VALUE OF 23\% WHICH IS MODERATE.

ADDRESSING THE PHYSICAL AND LEGAL COMPLEXITIES OF VERTICALLY STRATIFIED OWNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS IS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS THE MODERNIZATION OF CADASTRAL SYSTEMS. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM THAT THIS STUDY ADDRESSES IS THE LACK OF A SIMPLIFIED AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR MODELLING, STORING, VISUALIZING, AND QUERYING 3D CADASTRAL DATA FOR MULTI-STORY BUILDINGS. THIS RESEARCH PRIMARILY LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPROACH BASED ON BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM), AS WELL AS STATE-OF-THE-ART ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, LOAD), DATABASE AND VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR 3D CADASTRAL DATA LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT IN CURRENT PRACTICES. THE PROPOSED STEPS FOR RECORDING, PRESERVING, AND DISSEMINATING 3D CADASTRAL DATA ARE CRUCIAL IN SHIFTING CURRENT 2D CADASTRAL SYSTEMS TOWARDS 3D DIGITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN DATA CREATION, STORAGE, CONVERSION, AND COMMUNICATION WHEN UPGRADING FROM A 2D TO 3D DIGITAL CADASTRE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY CONFIRMED THAT STREAMLINING THE LIFECYCLE OF CADASTRAL DATA USING 3D ENVIRONMENTS WOULD MITIGATE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT FRAGMENTED 2D CADASTRAL DATASETS USED IN THE MULTI-STORY DEVELOPMENTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","642","OLFATH@UNIMELB.EDU.AU BEHNAM.ATAZADEH@UNIMELB.EDU.AU FARSHAD.BADIEE@UNIMELB.EDU.AU YIQUN.C@UNIMELB.EDU.AU SHOJAEID@UNIMELB.EDU.AU ABBAS.R@UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/land10060642","SZ3HP","2073-445X",NA,NA,"LAND USE VICTORIA, WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, LAND, WATER AND PLANNING (DELWP)","THIS RESEARCH WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY LAND USE VICTORIA, WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, LAND, WATER AND PLANNING (DELWP).",NA,NA,"LAND","LAND","ENGLISH","JUN",NA,"65","6","GOLD, GREEN PUBLISHED","ATAZADEH, BEHNAM/0000-0001-9295-4220 OLFAT, HAMED/0000-0003-1888-007X SHOJAEI, DAVOOD/0000-0003-2152-9272",NA,NA,"MDPI","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","RAJABIFARD, ABBAS/D-1818-2015 CHEN, YIQUN/K-5136-2018 OLFAT, HAMED/AAA-7356-2019 SHOJAEI, DAVOOD/ABA-8728-2020 ATAZADEH, BEHNAM/K-8913-2018 ",NA,6,"A PROPOSAL FOR STREAMLINING 3D DIGITAL CADASTRAL DATA LIFECYCLE","ARTICLE","WOS000666460900001","0","11","10","ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"OLFAT HAMED;ATAZADEH BEHNAM;BADIEE FARSHAD;CHEN YIQUN;SHOJAEI DAVOOD;RAJABIFARD ABBAS","OLFAT, H (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MELBOURNE, CTR SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCT \& LAND ADM, DEPT INFRASTRUCT ENGN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3010, AUSTRALIA","ISI","LAND","UNIV MELBOURNE;UNIV MELBOURNE","UNIV MELBOURNE",NA,"OLFAT H, 2021, LAND","OLFAT H, 2021, LAND",NA

THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THE INTEROPERABILITY OF THE GAME ENGINE AND USE LCC ANALYSIS TO ENHANCE VISUALIZATION AND EDUCATION. INEXPERIENCED OWNERS OR STAKEHOLDERS HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INITIAL COST AND LCC, AND THEREFORE TYPICALLY CHOOSE THE INITIAL VALUE, WHICH SEEMS ECONOMICAL FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER, HOWEVER, WAS TO CREATE A BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE THAT HELPS OWNERS, STAKEHOLDERS, OR STUDENTS VISUALIZE AND QUICKLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LCC AND INITIAL COST. TO THIS END, THE AUTHORS CREATE A BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE THAT INTEGRATES BIM WITH A GAME ENGINE SIMULATION ( I. E., UNITY 3D) INTO AN LCC ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION. THE BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE ALLOWS USERS TO NAVIGATE THEIR BUILDING ENVIRONMENTS WITH THE CAPABILITY OF SIMULATING THE LCC. THE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE A COMBINATION FROM AMONG MANY FIELDS INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, AND GAME DEVELOPMENT. THESE ELEMENTS CONNECT VARIOUS AREAS SUCH AS BUILDING MODELING, ANIMATION, NAVIGATION, AND COLLISION DETECTION. CHANGING THE MATERIALS AND ADDING CONSTRUCTION ACCESSORIES SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVED THE LCC AND THE INTERACTION OF GAME ENGINE CONTROLLERS AND THE PLAYER'S INTERFACE. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED A SURVEY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE. THE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR USING THE SYSTEM IN FUTURE PROJECTS.","UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA","WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY- IRAQ",NA,"SAGIDMAHDIOMA.OMARAN@WMICH.EDU ABDULAZIZABDUL.ALGHAMDI@WMICH.EDU SALAMSALMANCH.ALHARISHAWI@WMICH.EDU DECKER.HAINS@WMICH.EDU",NA,"COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: VISUALIZATION, INFORMATION MODELING, AND SIMULATION","2024-12-23",NA,"BN6AO",NA,NA,"CHO, YK AND LEITE, F AND BEHZADAN, A AND WANG, C",NA,NA,"978-0-7844-8242-1",NA,NA,"COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: VISUALIZATION, INFORMATION MODELING, AND SIMULATION","ENGLISH",NA,"ASCE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING (I3CE), GEORGIA INST TECHNOL, ATLANTA, GEORGIA, JUN 17-19, 2019","20",NA,NA,"ALHARISHAWI, SALAM SALMAN CHIAD/0000-0002-4085-7952 OMARAN, SAGID/0000-0001-9070-0710","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, COMP DIV; AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","120-128","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING","OMARAN, SAGID/AAE-4905-2019 ALHARISHAWI, SALAM/AAD-3836-2021 ",NA,7,"INTEGRATING BIM AND GAME ENGINE FOR SIMULATION INTERACTIVE LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000484892800016","0","7",NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2019,"OMARAN SAGID M;ALGHAMDI ABDULAZIZ A;ALHARISHAWI SALAM C;HAINS DECKER B","OMARAN, SM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIV, DEPT CIVIL \& CONSTRUCT ENGN, KALAMAZOO, MI 49008 USA","ISI","COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: VISUALIZATION, INFORMATION MODELING, AND SIMULATION","WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIV;UNIV TECHNOL BAGHDAD;WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIV;UNIV TECHNOL BAGHDAD","WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIV",NA,"OMARAN SM, 2019, COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: VISUALIZATION, INFORMATION MODELING, AND SIMULATION","OMARAN SM, 2019, COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2019: VISUALIZATION, INFORMATION MODELING, AND SIMULATION",NA

DESPITE ITS IMMENSE BENEFIT OF AIDING COMPLIANCE TO SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION, POTENTIAL BARRIERS CONTINUE TO WIDEN THE GAP IN IMPLEMENTATION. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY ADOPTS THE ``INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELLING APPROACH'' TO ADVANCE A RANKED STRUCTURE OF THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF THE BARRIERS TO INTEGRATING BIM IN BUILDINGS SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT. THE ``MATRICE D'IMPACTS CROISES-MULTIPICATION APPLIQUE A CLASSEMENT ANALYSIS (MICMAC)'' WAS UTILISED TO CATEGORISE THE IDENTIFIED ADOPTION BARRIERS IN THE MODEL. THE IDENTIFIED BARRIERS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THEMSELVES ARE VALUABLE IN DISCUSSING THE CHALLENGES TO BIM-BASED LCA AND DEVELOPING POLICIES AND DESIGN DECISIONS TO DRIVE THE PROCESS FURTHER. FURTHER, IT ADDS TO THE EMERGING DISCUSSION OF BIM FROM THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT PERSPECTIVE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

IN ORDER TO MOVE TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY, THE UTILIZATION OF THE BY-PRODUCTS OF AGRO-INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE FLY ASH (FA) AND RICE HUSK ASH (RHA), IN THE PRODUCTION OF CONCRETE HAS BEEN STUDIED. CONSIDERING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CONCRETE CONSTITUENTS, MULTIPLE MECHANICAL AND HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES OF FLY ASH (FA) AND RICE HUSK ASH (RHA) CONCRETE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED USING INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) AND EVOLUTIONARY POLYNOMIAL REGRESSIONS (EPR). ALSO, AN INTELLIGENT MIX DESIGN TOOL/CHART FOR THIS CASE UNDER STUDY IS PROPOSED. MULTIPLE DATA POINTS OF CONCRETE MATERIALS, WHICH WERE FURTHER REDUCED TO RATIOS AS FOLLOWS; CEMENT TO BINDER RATIO (C/B), AGGREGATE TO BINDER RATIO (AG/B), AND PLASTICIZER TO BINDER RATIO (PL/B) WERE USED IN THIS EXERCISE. AT THE END OF THE PROTOCOL, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE CONSTITUENTS' RATIOS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE WHOLE, WHICH CAN BE SOLVED BY USING THE PROPOSED MODEL EQUATIONS AND MIX DESIGN CHARTS. THE MODELS PERFORMED OPTIMALLY, AS NONE SHOWED ANY PERFORMANCE BELOW 80\%. HOWEVER, ANN, WHICH PREDICTED FC03, FC07, FC28, FC60, FC90, FT28, FF28 \& FB28, S, EC28 \& K28, AND P WITH AN ACCURACY OF GREATER THAN 95\% EACH WITH AVERAGE ERROR OF LESS THAN 9.4\% EACH, IS CONSIDERED THE DECISIVE TECHNIQUE IN PREDICTING ALL THE STUDIED CONCRETE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT POTENTIAL OF THE CONCRETE MATERIALS.","DR KAVIANPOUR OFF, 3RD FL CIVIL ENGINEERING FAC, K N TOOSI UNIV TECHNOLOGY, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN","EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); FUTURE UNIVERSITY IN EGYPT; SHAHID BAHONAR UNIVERSITY OF KERMAN (SBUK); UNIVERSITY OF BIRJAND",NA,"AHMED.ABDELKHALEQ@FUE.EDU.EG",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.28991/CEJ-2022-08-12-018","N6PI4","2476-3055",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2676-6957","CIV.

TO QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BUILDING-STOCK MODELLING (BSM) IS COMMONLY USED. RECENTLY, THE FOCUS OF BSM HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). HOWEVER, IMPACT CATEGORIES ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND REPRESENTATIVE BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN USED. IN ADDITION, THE FUTURE STATE OF THE STOCK IS OFTEN CALCULATED AS A STEP-CHANGE TO HIGHLIGHT THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL OF AN IDEAL FUTURE STATE. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AN URBAN HOUSING-STOCK UNDER BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIOS USING A BUILDING-SPECIFIC GIS BASED MODEL APPLIED TO THE MULTI-FAMILY BUILDING STOCK OF THE CITY OF GOTHENBURG. THIS PAPER USES AN EXPLORATIVE LCA TO ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BASED ON DYNAMIC UPTAKE OF COMMON RENOVATION MEASURES AND RESULTING ENERGY SAVINGS UNTIL 2050. TWO MAIN SCENARIOS ARE USED WHERE THE RENOVATION LOGIC IS BASED ON EITHER END-OF-LIFE OF COMPONENTS OR COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND FURTHER DIVIDED USING LIMITING FACTORS REGARDING INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND ANNUAL SHARE OF THE STOCK TO BE RENOVATED. RESULTS SHOW POSSIBLE ENERGY SAVINGS OF UP TO 23\% AND A CORRESPONDING 31\% REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS. GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS AVOIDED DUE TO REDUCED ENERGY DEMAND ARE OFFSET BY UP TO 65\% BY ACCOUNTING FOR MATERIAL USE DUE TO CONSTRUCTION RELATED RENOVATION MEASURES. FOR SCENARIOS THAT FAVOUR CONSTRUCTION RELATED INTERVENTIONS, PV PANELS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJOR PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ACROSS THE 15 MID-POINT INDICATORS USED.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE","106391","MAGNUS.OSTERBRING@CHALMERS.SE",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106391","JK7AJ","1873-684X",NA,NA,"EIT CLIMATE-KIC; AOA ENERGY; SIREN; NCC AB; SWEDISH ENERGY AGENCY","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK EIT CLIMATE-KIC, AOA ENERGY, SIREN, NCC AB AND THE SWEDISH ENERGY AGENCY FOR FUNDING THE PROJECT.",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

THE UNITED STATES GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL (USGBC) HAS MADE IT AN OPTION FOR RECEIVING POINTS IN VERSION 4 OF ITS LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) RATING SYSTEM. YET, THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER HAS REVEALED THAT THE PROCESS OF WBLCA AS APPLIED TO LEED IS NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD BY BUILDING PROFESSIONALS. AS MANY BUILDING PROFESSIONALS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WBLCA, VERY FEW PURSUE IT FOR THEIR NEW BUILDING PROJECTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WAS TO EXAMINE AND CLARIFY ISSUES RELATED TO WBLCA AS IT APPLIES TO LEED. THE PAPER PRESENTS A SIX-STEP PROCESS FOR CONDUCTING A WBLCA AND USE THE PROCESS ON A BUILDING CASE STUDY FOR WHICH A LEED COMPLIANT WBLCA WAS CONDUCTED AND APPROVED. THE PAPER ALSO SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CURRENT LEED WBLCA REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FURTHER REDUCE THE EMBODIED ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MATERIALS USED IN NEW BUILDING PROJECTS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THE PAPER IS TO INCREASE THE BUILDING INDUSTRY AWARENESS OF THE WBLCA PROCESS AND MAKE IT ``BUSINESS AS USUAL''. (C) 2021 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE BUILDING DESIGN PHASE HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO REDUCE BUILDING LIFE-CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS (LCCO2). HOWEVER, THE LACK OF DETAILED INVENTORY DATA AT THE DESIGN STAGE MAKES CALCULATING A BUILDING'S LCCO2 VERY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX. THEREFORE, ACCURATE PREDICTION OF BUILDING LCCO2 AT THE DESIGN STAGE USING RELEVANT DESIGN FACTORS IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN ENSEMBLE LEARNING ALGORITHM COMBINING BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (BO-XGBOOST) TO PREDICT LCCO2 ACCURATELY IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. FIRST, THIS STUDY COLLECTED AND CALCULATED THE LCCO2 OF 121 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN CHENGDU, CHINA. SECOND, A CARBON EMISSION PREDICTION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED USING XGBOOST BASED ON 15 DESIGN FACTORS, AND HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION WAS PERFORMED USING THE BO ALGORITHM. FINALLY, THE MODEL PERFORMANCE WAS EVALUATED USING TWO EVALUATION METRICS, COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R-2) AND ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE), AND THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE OF OTHER MODELS WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE BO-XGBOOST MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RMSE OF THE PROPOSED BO-XGBOOST FOR PREDICTING LCCO2 IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IS AT LEAST 40\% LOWER COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS.

THE PREFABRICATION APPROACH HAS BEEN PROMOTED AND INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED INTO BUILDING ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION, WHICH HAS ATTRACTED INCREASING RESEARCH INTO THE LIFE-CYCLE CARBON ASSESSMENT (LCCA) OF PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, THERE EXIST CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES AND, THROUGH RETHINKING THEIR THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTALS, PROPOSES SOLUTIONS WITH THE AIM TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF RESEARCH INTO THE LCCA OF PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS. THE CHALLENGES ARE FOUND TO BE IMPLICIT SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF PREFABRICATION AND LCCA: INCONSISTENT METHODS, MODELS AND UNITS OF ANALYSIS OF ESTIMATING BUILDINGS' LIFE-CYCLE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND LCCA BEING A LABOUR-INTENSIVE PROCESS WITH LIMITED ACCOUNTABILITY. THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE A REGRESSION MODEL OF RELATING BUILDINGS' LCCA TO 12 SYSTEM BOUNDARIES, EXPRESSED BY THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES' INCONSISTENCY RATIO (I-R), WHICH SHOWS THE LEVEL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY TWO SYSTEM BOUNDARIES; A FIVE-LEVEL FRAMEWORK OF UNITS OF ANALYSIS CONSISTING OF MATERIAL, COMPONENT, ASSEMBLY, FLAT AND BUILDING; AND A SMART-TECHNOLOGY-INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR AUTOMATIC LCCA. THE SOLUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT AND TIMELY TO HELP REDUCE BUILDINGS' LIFE-CYCLE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS EFFECTIVELY FOR ACHIEVING LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF SOCIETY.","INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG",NA,"WPAN@HKU.HK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1680/jensu.17.00063","HI5HJ","1751-7680",NA,NA,"GENERAL RESEARCH FUND OF THE HONG KONG RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL [17207115]","THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER WAS SUPPORTED BY A GRANT FROM THE GENERAL RESEARCH FUND OF THE HONG KONG RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL (PROJECT NUMBER 17207115).

MANY SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTIES AFFECT ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING. THEREFORE, THE RELIABILITY OF DECISIONS BASED ON BUILDING LCA IS QUESTIONED. HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON UNCERTAINTIES CAN STRENGTHEN DECISIONS, WHEN PROPERLY ADDRESSED. IN THIS STUDY, SEVEN STATISTICAL METRICS ARE COMPARED BASED ON DEPENDENT SAMPLINGS FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSES (SA) AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSES (UA). IT ALLOWS TO IDENTIFY A SET OF INDICATORS ON WHICH CONCLUSIONS ARE MORE RELIABLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THIS METHOD-OLOGY IS APPLIED TO COMPARATIVE BUILDING LCA, CONSIDERING THREE CONSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES: A CONCRETE, A CONCRETE BLOCKS AND A WOODEN-FRAMED HOUSE. A NEW SA METHOD, BASED ON MORRIS, HELPS IDENTIFYING WHICH OF 153 UNCERTAIN FACTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS. MORE PRECISE DATA IS THEN COLLECTED ON THESE UNCERTAIN FACTORS. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE HEIJUNGS SIGNIFICANCE METRIC AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF RELATIVE DIFFERENCES WERE THE MOST APPROPRIATE METRICS TO ASSESS UA RESULTS. THEY ALLOW TO DETERMINE, FOR EACH INDICATOR, WHICH IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE AND HOW MUCH BETTER IT PERFORMS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE NON-CONCLUSIVE INDICATORS ARE DISCARDED. APPLYING THIS METHODOLOGY, DECISION ARE ENHANCED BY UNCERTAINTIES AND RELY ON A SMALLER SET OF INDICATORS TO SELECT AN ALTER-NATIVE IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITE PSL; MINES PARISTECH; UNIVERSITE D'ANGERS","110543","MARIE-LISE.PANNIER@UNIV-ANGERS.FR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110543","M6YB7","1873-684X","JUL 2023",NA,"RESEARCH CHAIR PARISTECH VINCI ``ECO-DESIGN OF BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE'' IN FRANCE","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RESEARCH CHAIR PARISTECH VINCI ``ECO-DESIGN OF BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE'' IN FRANCE.",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

DUE TO ITS MAGNITUDE, SUSTAINABLE ROAD CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES CAN SUPPORT NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (E.G. THE FEDERAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF CANADA). HOWEVER, THE QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE ROAD CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE LACK OF EXPERTISE, INFORMATION, AND RESOURCES. THE ADVENT OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PROVIDES MORE EXTENSIVE ACCESS TO FUNCTIONAL AND PHYSICAL DATA OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL.

THIS FRAMEWORK COMPARES THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE OF ALTERNATIVE ROAD PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION METHODS. A BIM-BASED VISUAL PROGRAM HAS BEEN CREATED TO AUTOMATE THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. THE PROGRAM WAS DEMONSTRATED BY COMPARING THREE ROAD CONSTRUCTION METHODS FOR A COLLECTOR ROAD. RESULTS INDICATED THAT GEOMEMBRANE ROAD IS THE BEST SOLUTION BASED ON THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE OF SUSTAINABILITY. THE PROPOSED LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA) FRAMEWORK, A BIM-BASED TOOL, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION ROAD MAP WILL ASSIST INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGERS IN SELECTING THE MOST SUSTAINABLE ROAD CONSTRUCTION METHOD THAT WILL CONSEQUENTLY SUPPORT UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG).","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF WINDSOR",NA,"RAJEEV.RUPARATHNA@UWINDSOR.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15623599.2021.2017113","G7JA2","2331-2327","DEC 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1562-3599","INT.

HOWEVER, THE STUDY OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER A BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE BASED ON ECOTECT AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING IN DEVELOPING AREAS OF NANJING HAS YET TO BE CONDUCTED. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS PAPER REPRESENT A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THIS PAPER IS THAT ECOTECT AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING CAN BE HELPFUL IN SIMPLIFYING THE ESTIMATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER A BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE A MAJORITY OF THE INFORMATION AND CALCULATION TOOLS NECESSARY FOR PERFORMING AN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH MAY ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WHEN EXECUTING AN LCA OF A BUILDING. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY CHANGING SEVERAL PARAMETERS TO IDENTIFY THE PARAMETERS THAT HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACTS ON THE PERFORMANCE A BUILDING. A COMPARISON OF THE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS FOR EACH STAGE SHOWED THAT THE OPERATIONAL STAGE IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO CARBON EMISSIONS. APPROXIMATELY 85.4\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS WERE GENERATED DURING OPERATION. THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE ACCOUNTED FOR 12.6\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS. APPROXIMATELY 2\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS OCCURRED DURING THE DEMOLITION STAGE. COMPARED TO THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE BUILDING, CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY VEGETATION WAS MINIMAL. THUS, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN ACHIEVE THE GREATEST REDUCTIONS IN CARBON EMISSIONS BY TARGETING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDRESSING NON-OPERATIONAL PHASES SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED BECAUSE THE AVERAGE CARBON EMISSIONS PER WORKING AREA PER YEAR OF NON-OPERATIONAL STAGES ARE FAR GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE USE PHASE.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN DECISIONS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN A BUILDING'S CARBON FOOTPRINT, MAKING IT ESSENTIAL TO INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES AT VARIOUS DESIGN STAGES. INTEGRATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) CAN SUPPORT DESIGNERS IN ACHIEVING LOW-CARBON ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TOOL. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO OPTIMIZING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTS. IT COMBINES MACHINE LEARNING (ML), LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS), AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TECHNOLOGIES. THE FIRST CASE STUDIES PRESENT SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF TOOLS DEVELOPED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE FIRST CASE STUDY DETAILS A MACHINE LEARNING-ASSISTED TOOL USED FOR ESTIMATING CARBON FOOTPRINTS DURING THE DESIGN PHASE AND SHOWS NUMERICAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OPTIMIZATION RESULTS. THE SECOND CASE STUDY EXPLORES THE USE OF LLMS, SPECIFICALLY CHATGPT, AS VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS TO SUGGEST OPTIMIZATIONS IN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND SHOWS TESTS ON THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY THE LLM.

THESE COVER RAW MATERIAL EXTRACTION AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING THROUGH TO CONSTRUCTION AND END OF LIFE ACTIVITIES.

TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING GLOBAL EFFORT TO MITIGATE EMBODIED CARBON AND EQUIP ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS WORLDWIDE WITH EASY-TO-USE AND ROBUST CALCULATION TOOLS, WE DESCRIBE A REAL-TIME DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL TO AID BUILDING DESIGN THAT LEVERAGES MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE TO SPEED-UP THE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE PROCESS OF FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS (FEA) TRADITIONALLY EXPLOITED IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT REPLACING FEA CALCULATIONS WITH A MODEL LEARNT USING ML FROM A LARGE DATASET OFFERS REAL TIME DECISION SUPPORT WHILE GUARANTEEING THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND ACCURACY THAT A TRADITIONAL FEA-BASED METHOD WOULD OFFER AT THE DESIGN STAGE. THE TOOL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BOTH AS A STANDALONE VERSION AND AS A PLUGIN FOR TRIMBLE SKETCHUP TO MAXIMISE ITS USABILITY AND DIFFUSION. IT OFFERS RESULTS CORRELATED WITH UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN THE FORM OF PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INHERENT VARIABILITY OF INPUT DATA THAT CHARACTERISES EARLY STAGES IN THE DESIGN PROCESS.

IN THE DESIGN PROCESS OF A BUILDING, THE USE OF A LOWER INITIAL COST INDEX TO SELECT AN OPTION AMONG OTHERS WITH SIMILAR PERFORMANCE MAY NOT LEAD TO AN ECONOMICALLY OPTIMAL ALTERNATIVE DURING THE LIFE CYCLE. HENCE, TODAY, BUILDING DESIGNERS AND INVESTORS REQUIRE A TOOL TO ESTIMATE LIFE CYCLE COST AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE TO SELECT AN ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT OPTION. RESILIENT SOLUTIONS GENERALLY LEAD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY AND UPFRONT COSTS AND CARRY ADDITIONAL EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AS WELL. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF RESILIENT BUILDINGS USING A SOUND LCC METHODOLOGY IN THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN STAGE. THE RESEARCH AIMS TO INTEGRATE LCC CAPABILITIES DIRECTLY INTO A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) AND INCREASE THE ECONOMICAL RELEVANCE AND SCIENTIFIC ROBUSTNESS OF LCC INDICATORS TOWARDS BETTER LCC COST OPTIMIZATION. THE PLUGIN, WHICH IS DEVELOPED IN THE BIM TOOL IS REPRESENTED TO USE COST AND RESILIENCY FACTORS TO PREDICT THE WHOLE PROCESS COST OF BUILDING PROJECTS TO ASSIST DESIGNERS IN SELECTING A COST-EFFICIENT AND RESILIENT DESIGN OPTION. THE LCC OF A BUILDING INCLUDES ITS INITIAL COST, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COST, OPERATING COST AND SALVAGE VALUE AT THE END OF THE BUILDING'S USEFUL LIFE, AND ALL OF WHICH WERE CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATION. THE EARTHQUAKE EXPECTED FAILURE AND HUMAN FATALITY COST ARE CALCULATED TO CONSIDER THE RESILIENCY INDEX IN BUILDING DESIGN. THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK TO DESIGN A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED ON TWO DESIGN OPTIONS. THE APPLICATION OF THE ACTUAL BUILDING PROJECT ILLUSTRATES THAT BY INCREASING THE INITIAL COST IN THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE BY 4.6\%, ITS ANNUAL EXPECTED FAILURE COST IS DECREASED BY 35.4\%, AND ITS TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE COST IS REDUCED BY ALMOST 10.4\% WITHIN THE FIRST 45 YEARS OF OPERATION. THE REDUCTION IN THE COST OF THE BUILDING AND HUMAN FATALITY DUE TO FAILURE DURING AN EARTHQUAKE MEANS THE BUILDING'S RESILIENCE WOULD BE IMPROVED.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR SUCH PERFORMANCES THROUGH ESTABLISHING THE BASELINE REQUIREMENTS TO MEET THE RATING SYSTEM NEEDS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WAS USED TO MODEL A CONCRETE MASONRY UNIT (CMU) BLOCK WALL WITH VARIOUS INSULATION THICKNESSES ASSIGNED VARIOUS INSULATION LAYER THICKNESSES DEPENDING ON THE INSULATION MATERIAL PROPERTY. MULTIPLE SCENARIOS WERE CREATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEVERAL ENERGY CODES AND ITS DIFFERENT VERSIONS. THE SCENARIOS MODELED WERE THEN ANALYZED USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TO CALIBRATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT ENERGY CODES USED AS BASELINE CODES FOR DIFFERENT GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS ACCORDING TO RESPECTIVE ENERGY BASELINE CODES AND THEIR VERSIONS ADOPTED. TENDENCIES TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENT WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL BUILDINGS WERE OBSERVED. COMPARING THE DIFFERENT CODES WITH THE DIRECT IMPACT ON THE GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS SHOWS THAT RAPID DEVELOPMENT IN ENERGY CODES SURPASSED THE IMPACT RESULTED FROM ADOPTING THE GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS. THE AMOUNT OF REDUCTION IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND TANGIBLE DUE TO CHANGE IN THE ENERGY CODE.

IN THIS PAPER, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) ARE CARRIED OUT IN THE EARLY AND DETAILED BUILDING DESIGN STAGES. THE METHOD IS APPLIED TO A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IN QUEBEC, CANADA. THE BIM IS CONDUCTED WITH REVIT, AND THE LCA WITH OPENLCA. TO PREPARE THE REVIT OUTPUTS AS THE APPROPRIATE INPUTS OF THE LCA MODEL, A FUNCTIONAL DATABASE WAS DEVELOPED. IT INCLUDES ALL BUILDING ASSEMBLIES, LAYERS AND POSSIBLE MATERIALS COMMONLY FOUND IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN QUEBEC. THE ECOINVENT DATABASE WAS USED TO SOURCE OF LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) DATA FOR EACH MATERIAL. TO MANAGE INFORMATION UNCERTAINTY IN THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE, A PROBABILITY FUNCTION WAS ASSIGNED TO EACH MATERIAL. AT THE DETAILED DESIGN STAGE, ALL MATERIAL TYPES AND QUANTITIES WERE SPECIFIED IN BIM FILE, WHICH WAS USED IN THE LCA STUDY. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE BUILDING STAGES AND ASSEMBLIES WERE CALCULATED TO DETERMINE THE BEST BUILDING ASSEMBLY OPTIONS FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE-A PROCESS THAT COULD GUIDE BUILDING DESIGNERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR DESIGNS, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SELECT MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS FOR EACH ASSEMBLY AND THUS REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE BUILDING.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITE DE MONTREAL; UNIVERSITY OF QUEBEC; UNIVERSITY OF QUEBEC MONTREAL; UNIVERSITE DE MONTREAL; POLYTECHNIQUE MONTREAL",NA,"FARZANEH.REZAEI15@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.01.034","HP1VV","1873-684X",NA,NA,"NSERC CREATE GRANT PROGRAM","THE AUTHORS ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE NSERC CREATE GRANT PROGRAM FOR ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT.",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL MATERIALS USED TO ACCOMPLISH ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARE NOT USUALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE-CYCLE COST ASSESSMENT (LCCA) APPROACHES HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY APPLIED TO ANALYZE BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS. HOWEVER, LCA AND LCCA ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE AND ARE USUALLY PERFORMED IN LATE DESIGN STAGES WHEN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE IMPACTS IS COSTLY TO ACHIEVE. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED, STREAMLINED LCA-LCCA APPROACH TO BUILDING RETROFITS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS AT EARLY-DESIGN STAGE DECISIONS. WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK THAT FULLY INTEGRATES A STREAMLINED EMBODIED LCA, STATISTICAL-BASED OPERATIONAL ENERGY, AND COST MODELS. THIS APPROACH INCORPORATES UNCERTAINTY TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF INFORMATION IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES BY USING THE BUILDING ATTRIBUTE TO IMPACT ALGORITHM APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES STRUCTURED UNDER-SPECIFICATION AND PROBABILISTIC TRIAGE. AN AUTOMATED PROCESS ENABLES SEVERAL SCENARIOS TO BE ASSESSED AND COMPARED AS A MEANS OF BETTER INFORMING DESIGNERS OF THE RELATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF MATERIALS AND DIMENSIONING CHOICES. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT BY SELECTING VERY FEW ATTRIBUTES AND THEN COMPARING SEVERAL OPTIONS, ROBUST RETROFIT DECISIONS CAN BE MADE IN EARLY-DESIGN STAGES, THEREBY PROMOTING A REDUCTION IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS.

DIFFERENT USER BEHAVIOR PATTERNS CAN THEREFORE YIELD LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE RESULTS OF A CRADLE-TO-GRAVE ASSESSMENT. ALTHOUGH THIS VARIATION AND UNCERTAINTY IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED, IT REMAINS OFTEN POORLY CHARACTERIZED IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES. TODAY, PERVASIVE SENSING PRESENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT RICH DATA SETS AND IMPROVE PROFILING OF USE-PHASE PARAMETERS, IN TURN FACILITATING QUANTIFICATION AND REDUCTION OF THIS UNCERTAINTY IN LCA. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE CASE OF ENERGY USE IN BUILDING COOLING SYSTEMS, FOCUSING ON GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) AS THE IMPACT CATEGORY. IN SINGAPORE, BUILDING COOLING SYSTEMS OR AIR CONDITIONING CONSUMES UP TO 37\% OF NATIONAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND. LACK OF CONSIDERATION OF VARIATION IN USE-PHASE INTERACTION LEADS TO THE OVERSIZED DESIGNS, WASTED ENERGY, AND THEREFORE REDUCIBLE GWP. USING A HIGH-RESOLUTION DATA SET DERIVED FROM SENSOR OBSERVATIONS, ENERGY USE AND BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF SINGLE-OFFICE OCCUPANTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY PROBABILISTIC DISTRIBUTIONS. THE INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY AND USE-PHASE VARIABLES WERE PROPAGATED IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEMS AND SIMULATED BY WAY OF MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS OF THE GENERATED UNCERTAINTIES IDENTIFIED PLAUSIBLE REDUCTIONS IN GLOBAL WARMING IMPACT THROUGH MODIFYING USER INTERACTION. DESIGNERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE OF THEIR PRODUCTS OR SYSTEMS NEED BETTER REPRESENTATION OF THE UNDERLYING VARIABILITY IN USE-PHASE DATA TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT.

WITHIN THE FLAGSHIP PROJECT OF THE LIFE CYCLE INITIATIVE (HOSTED BY UN ENVIRONMENT), AIMING AT GLOBAL GUIDANCE FOR LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) INDICATORS, A DEDICATED SUBTASK FORCE WAS CONSTITUTED TO CONSOLIDATE THE EVALUATION OF ES IN LCA. AS ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THIS SUBTASK FORCE, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PROGRESS TOWARDS CONSENSUS BUILDING IN THE LCA DOMAIN CONCERNING THE ASSESSMENT OF ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED SERVICES FOR HUMAN WELL-BEING. TO THIS END, THE TRADITIONAL LCIA STRUCTURE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE CAUSE-EFFECT CHAIN FROM STRESSOR TO IMPACTS AND DAMAGES, IS RE-TASTED AND EXPANDED USING THE LENS OF THE ES `CASCADE MODEL'. THIS LINKS CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION TO CHANGES IN HUMAN WELL-BEING, WHILE LCIA LINKS THE EFFECT OF CHANGES ON ECOSYSTEMS DUE TO HUMAN IMPACTS (E.G. LAND USE CHANGE, EUTROPHICATION, FRESHWATER DEPLETION) TO THE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE QUALITY AND/OR QUANTITY OF SUPPLIED ES. THE PROPOSED CASCADE MODELLING FRAMEWORK COMPLEMENTS TRADITIONAL LCIA WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTERNALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF ES, FOR WHICH THE OVERALL COST-BENEFIT RESULT MIGHT BE EITHER NEGATIVE (I.E. DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THE ES PROVISION) OR POSITIVE (I.E. INCREASE OF ES PROVISION). IN SO DOING, THE FRAMEWORK INTRODUCES INTO TRADITIONAL LCIA THE NOTION OF ``BENEFIT'' ( IN THE FORM OF ES SUPPLY FLOWS AND ECOSYSTEMS' CAPACITY TO GENERATE SERVICES) WHICH BALANCES THE QUANTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL INTERVENTION FLOWS AND RELATED IMPACTS (IN THE FORM OF ES DEMANDS) THAT ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED IN LCA. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE EVENTUALLY PROVIDED TO FURTHER ADDRESS CURRENT GAPS IN THE ANALYSIS OF ES WITHIN THE LCA METHODOLOGY. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE USE OF INTEGRATED WEIGH-IN-MOTION (WIM) SYSTEMS IN ROADWAY BRIDGES ALLOWS TO COLLECT ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR TRACKING ACTUAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS. BASED ON WIM DATA, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED TO THE EVALUATION OF THE PROBABILITY OF FATIGUE FAILURE IS REDUCED, ALLOWING THE OPTIMAL SCHEDULING OF REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND THUS IMPROVING SAFETY AND ECONOMIC SAVINGS. THE PAPER PRESENTS A METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING FATIGUE LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) OF ROADWAY BRIDGES EQUIPPED WITH A WIM SYSTEM THAT CONSIDERS UNCERTAINTIES IN MEASUREMENT AND MODELLING ERRORS. THE PROCEDURE ALLOWS THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE ECONOMIC GAIN ENABLED BY WIM SYSTEMS, USEFUL IN ASSESSING THE COST/ACCURACY TRADE-OFF FOR A GIVEN WIM SYSTEM. IT IS FOUND THAT THE CONTINUOUS USE OF A WIM SYSTEM MAY IMPROVE THE RATE OF DECREASE OF THE STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY INDEX, COMPARED WITH TEMPORALLY LIMITED USE OF WIM DATA. THE PERIODIC UPDATE OF THE RELIABILITY INDEX AND OF THE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE BASED ON WIM MEASUREMENTS RESULTS IN A RATHER ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF THE FATIGUE LIFE CYCLE COST, WHICH IS CRUCIAL IN IDENTIFYING THE PAYBACK TIME OF THE WIM SYSTEM.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF PERUGIA; IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"ILARIA.VENANZI@UNIPG.IT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15732479.2021.2023589","L9FQ5","1744-8980","DEC 2021",NA,"``CASSA DI RISPARMIO DI PERUGIA'' FOUNDATION [2019.0338.029]","THE AUTHORS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE ``CASSA DI RISPARMIO DI PERUGIA'' FOUNDATION, THAT FUNDED THIS STUDY THROUGH THE PROJECT ``DEVELOPMENT OF AN ORIGINAL LIFE-CYCLE COST MODEL FOR THE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF BRIDGES AND VIADUCTS EQUIPPED WITH SHM SYSTEMS'' (GRANT NUMBER 2019.0338.029), AND THE SUPPORT OF BRENT PHARES AT IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION THAT PROVIDED THE FIELD MONITORING DATA.",NA,"1573-2479","STRUCT.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS PRESCRIBE LCC AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCA) TO ASSESS MATERIALS' ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE EXISTING METHODS OF LCC AND LCA ARE TEDIOUS AND TIME-CONSUMING, REDUCING THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO INTEGRATE LCC AND LCA WITH BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TO DEVELOP A SWIFT AND EFFICIENT APPROACH FOR EVALUATING THE LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE OF INFILL MATERIALS.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE BIM MODEL FOR A CASE STUDY WAS PREPARED USING AUTODESK REVIT (R), AND THE STUDY INCLUDED FOUR INFILL MATERIALS (LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE CONCRETE BLOCK (LECA), AUTOCLAVED CELLULAR CONCRETE (AAC), CONCRETE MASONRY AND BRICKS). LCC WAS CONDUCTED USING REVIT (R) AND AUTODESK INSIGHT 360 (R) TO ESTIMATE COSTS INCURRED ACROSS DIFFERENT PROJECT PHASES. LCA WAS CONDUCTED USING ``ONE CLICK LCA (R),'' A BIM-BASED PLATFORM FEATURING A COMPREHENSIVE MATERIAL INVENTORY. CARBON EMISSIONS, ACIDIFICATION, AND EUTROPHICATION WERE CHOSEN AS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FACTORS FOR LCA.FINDINGSLECA WAS THE PREFERRED CHOICE DUE TO ITS LOWER COST AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. ITS LIFETIME COST OF \$440,618 WAS 5.4\% LOWER THAN BRICKS', WITH 2.8\% LOWER CO2 EMISSIONS THAN AAC'S, WHICH WERE SECOND-PLACE OPTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. LECA HAD 6.4 AND 27\% LOWER COSTS THAN CONCRETE BLOCKS, AND AAC'S CARBON EMISSIONS WERE 32 AND 58\% LOWER THAN CONCRETE BLOCKS AND BRICKS, RESPECTIVELY.ORIGINALITY/VALUEBIM HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS IN EXISTING LITERATURE, BUT ITS EFFICACY IN EVALUATING THE LIFETIME COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF INFILL MATERIALS REMAINS UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A BIM-BASED APPROACH FOR CONDUCTING LCC AND LCA OF INFILL MATERIALS, FACILITATING INFORMED DECISION-MAKING DURING THE PLANNING PHASE AND PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES.","FLOOR 5, NORTHSPRING 21-23 WELLINGTON STREET, LEEDS, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCES \& TECHNOLOGY - PAKISTAN; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY CORPUS CHRISTI; UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN QUEENSLAND; POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF TURIN",NA,"RAO\_NUST@YAHOO.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/SASBE-11-2023-0341","XI4Y8","2046-6102","JUL 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2046-6099","SMART SUSTAIN.

THEREFORE, IN MODERN CONSTRUCTION, WHILE MAINTAINING A SATISFACTORY AND COMFORTABLE INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT, LESS ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND RESOURCE USE IS A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING DESIGN. THIS RESEARCH EXPLORED LIFE CYCLE ENERGY (LCE), LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC) TO EVALUATE THE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING FACADES FOR THEIR SELECTION. A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK WAS PROPOSED CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS (TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE APPROACH). THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED TO A MEDIUM-RISE COMMERCIAL BUILDING IN THE CITY OF BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL. FOUR BUILDING FACADES (BRICK, GRANITE, ALUMINUM, AND GLASS FACADES) WERE SELECTED AND COMPARED BY THEIR LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS (I.E., IMPACTS IN THE PREUSE, USE, AND POSTURE PHASES). AN ENERGY MODEL WAS DEVELOPED IN DESIGNBUILDER 4.2 TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY DEMAND OF EACH FACADE DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE. LCA OF EACH FACADE WAS PERFORMED USING SIMAPRO 8 SOFTWARE. LATER, SELECTED FACADES WERE COMPARED USING MULTICRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS FOR THREE PROPOSED SCENARIOS: PROENVIRONMENT, NEUTRAL, AND PROECONOMIC. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, BRICK FACADE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FACADE IN THE NEUTRAL AND PROECONOMIC SCENARIO, WHEREAS A GRANITE FACADE WAS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE IN THE PROENVIRONMENT SCENARIO. LIFE CYCLE EMERGY ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THE PROENVIRONMENT SCENARIO RESULTS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES DECISION SUPPORT TO ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS FOR THE SELECTION OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDING FACADES BASED ON THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE OF SUSTAINABILITY.

PROCEEDINGS (LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL.2336), P28","SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND PRACTITIONERS OF THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) SECTOR HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING LIFE-CYCLE COST (LCC) CONCEPT FOR THE PAST DECADES. HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON A BUILDING'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE-CYCLE IS SELDOM READILY AVAILABLE OR ACCURATE. THIS HINDERS THE FULFILMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL STANDARDS, PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS, AND FOR BUILDING MANAGEMENT (BM) PROFESSIONALS TO FULLY INCORPORATE THE LCC CONCEPT INTO THEIR DAILY PRACTICE. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THESE DIFFICULTIES BY PRESENTING A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES LCC-INFORMED DECISIONS IN BM, TOGETHER WITH ITS EMPIRICAL APPLICATION TO A PORTFOLIO OF 158 PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS IN PORTUGAL (CONSTRUCTED AREA OF 1,437,594 M(2)). IT INVOLVED THE GATHERING, ORGANIZATION AND TREATMENT OF HISTORICAL DATA OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED FROM 1942 ONWARDS. THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS IS PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF THREE TYPES OF ECONOMIC LIFE-CYCLE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (TIME SERIES, INDEXES AND RELATIVE RATIOS). IT ORIGINATED A DATABASE WITH MORE THAN 1.4 MILLION RESULTS THAT OFFER A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS PORTFOLIO. THE RESULTS CAN BE ADAPTED AND USED TO BENCHMARK OR ESTIMATE CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, REHABILITATION, ENERGY CONSUMPTION, WATER CONSUMPTION AND DECONSTRUCTION COSTS OF BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","NATIONAL CIVIL ENGINEERING LABORATORY; UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA",NA,"ASALVADO@LNEC.PT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/09613218.2019.1612730","IM4HL","1466-4321","MAY 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0961-3218","BUILD.

LIFE CYCLE THINKING IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED, HOWEVER. LOCALLY AVAILABLE, ALTERNATIVE BUILDING CONCEPTS COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF ``AS-BUILT'' LOW-COST HOUSING FOR AN EXAMPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH USE OF THREE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES: CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAMES, SOIL-CEMENT BLOCKS, AND COCONUT BOARD-BASED HOUSING. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED WITH SOFTWARE SIMAPRO, USING THE SINGLE-IMPACT INDICATORS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) AND CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND (CED) AND THE MULTI-IMPACT INDICATOR IMPACT2002+. ACCORDING TO EN 15978, THE LIFE CYCLE PHASE PRODUCT AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS (A), USE STAGE (B), END-OF-LIFE (C) AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION BEYOND THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE (D) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED. THEORETICALLY CALCULATED INFLOWS FROM STANDARD CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES USED IN PHASE A HAVE BEEN VERIFIED WITH 3 YEARS OF EMPIRICAL DATA FROM IMPLEMENTED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. FOR PHASES B, C AND D, ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO SERVICE LIFE, USE-PHASE, ALLOCATION OF WASTE PRODUCTS, BIOGENIC CARBON AND LAND-USE ASSUMPTIONS. SCENARIOS REFLECT THE ACTUAL SITUATION IN THE EMERGING ECONOMY. PROCESSES, SUCH AS HEAT RECOVERY FROM THERMAL UTILIZATION, WHICH ARE NOT EXISTING NOR NEAR TO IMPLEMENTATION, WERE EXCLUDED. FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PHASES A-B-C-D WITH GWP, A 35\% REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FOR SOIL-CEMENT BLOCKS, 74\% FOR CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAME, AND 83\% FOR COCONUT BOARD-BASED HOUSES IS OBTAINED RELATIVE TO A CONCRETE REFERENCE HOUSE. IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, THIS RELATES TO A REDUCTION OF 4.4, 9.3, AND 10.3 T CO2 EQUIVALENTS OVER A SERVICE LIFE OF 25 YEARS. CED SHOWED HIGHER IMPACTS FOR THE BIOGENIC CONSTRUCTION METHODS COCONUT BOARD AND CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAMES OF +8.0 AND +4.7\%, WHILE THE SOIL-CEMENT TECHNOLOGY WAS EVALUATED -7.1\% COMPARED TO GWP. SIXTEEN OF 17 MIDPOINT CATEGORIES OF IMPACT2002+ CONFIRMED AN OVERALL REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF THE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING METHODS, WITH THE MIDPOINT CATEGORY LAND OCCUPATION BEING THE EXCEPTION RATING THE CONVENTIONAL PRACTICE OVER THE ALTERNATIVES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN CAUSED BY THE SOCIAL HOUSING SECTOR. THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES PLAYS A VITAL ROLE FOR IT. LCA FOR EMERGING ECONOMIES NEEDS TO INCORPORATE REALISTIC SCENARIOS APPLICABLE AT THEIR CURRENT STATE OR BELONGING TO THE MOST PROBABLE ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE VALUABLE RESULTS.

OPTIMIZATION METHODS ARE AT HAND, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW TO CONNECT AND COORDINATE THE UPDATING OF THE DOMAIN MODELS OF EACH DISCIPLINE AND CENTRALIZE THE PRODUCT DEFINITION INTO ONE SOURCE INSTEAD OF HAVING SEVERAL UNCONNECTED PRODUCT DEFINITIONS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) FEATURES THE IDEA OF CENTRALIZING THE PRODUCT DEFINITION TO A BIM-MODEL AND CREATING INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN MODELS FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH REPORTS ON DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FIELDS WITHIN CONSTRUCTION. RECENT RESEARCH FEATURES BIM-BASED OPTIMIZATION, BUT THERE IS STILL A QUESTION OF KNOWING HOW TO DESIGN A BIM-BASED PROCESS USING NEUTRAL FILE FORMATS TO ENABLE MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION OF LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY AND COST. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR NEUTRAL BIM-BASED MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION. THE FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF (1) A CENTRALIZED MASTER MODEL, FROM WHICH DIFFERENT DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC DOMAIN MODELS ARE GENERATED AND EVALUATED; AND (2) AN OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM CONTROLLING THE OPTIMIZATION LOOP. BASED ON THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, A PROTOTYPE WAS DEVELOPED AND USED IN A CASE STUDY OF A SWEDISH MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING TO TEST THE FRAMEWORK'S APPLICABILITY IN GENERATING AND OPTIMIZING MULTIPLE MODELS BASED ON THE BIM-MODEL. THE PROTOTYPE WAS DEVELOPED TO ENHANCE THE BUILDING'S SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE BY OPTIMIZING THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE BUILDING'S LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY (LCE) AND LIFE-CYCLE COST (LCC) WHEN CHOOSING MATERIAL FOR THE ENVELOPE.

AS A RESULT, THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS INCREASINGLY ADOPTING TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES THAT PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTIONS, I.E. CONSTRUCTIONS THAT HAVE LOW ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS. FOCUSING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCTION, THIS RESEARCH INTEGRATES THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY WITH THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC) METHODOLOGIES FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF BUILDINGS. BUILDING ON THE BIM-LCA/LCC FRAMEWORK AND ON THE INFORMATION DELIVERY MANUAL (IDM) AND MODEL VIEW DEFINITION (MVD) FOR THE BIM-LCA/LCC ANALYSIS, A BIM-BASED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (BIMEELCA) TOOL IS DEVELOPED BY THE AUTHORS AND DETAILED IN THIS ARTICLE. THE BIMEELCA TOOL IS USED TO SUPPORT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS DURING EARLY PHASES OF A PROJECT AND VERIFY THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING AUTOMATIC BIM-BASED LCA AND LCC ANALYSES IN HIGH-RISE PROJECTS. A 250 M HIGH-RISE APARTMENT, HOTEL, AND OFFICE BUILDING IS USED TO VALIDATE THE USEFULNESS OF THE TOOL AT THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE. THIS CASE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY TO PERFORM AN AUTOMATIC LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS AT THIS DESIGN STAGE BY INSERTING IN THE MODEL SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM GENERIC DATABASES. IN THE END, THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE BIMEELCA TOOL ARE DISCUSSED. THIS RESEARCH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROMOTION OF SEMANTICALLY RICH BIM MODELS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAILOR-MADE BIM OBJECTS' LIBRARIES SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF COMPANIES.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL; UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA","121705","RUBEN.E.C.SANTOS@TECNICO.ULISBOA.PT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121705","LY0MI","1879-1786",NA,NA,"VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL (VUB); DEPARTMENT OF MECHANICS OF MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTIONS (MEMC); PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE (FCT) AND TECHNOLOGY; CERIS, IST, UNIVERSITY OF LISBON","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR GRATITUDE TO BESIX FOR PROVIDING A CASE STUDY.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE AVAILABILITY AND POTENTIAL OF NATURAL DAYLIGHT REVIEWING THE SKY COMPONENT TYPE AT A DESIGNATED LOCATION, REAL-TIME SENSOR-BASED ILLUMINANCE MEASUREMENT ON-SITE AND BIM-BASED DAYLIGHT SIMULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, A SENSOR PROTOTYPE WAS DEPLOYED TO THE METRO RAIL STATION FOR AUTOMATED OPTIMIZATION. FIRSTLY, THE SKY COMPONENT TYPE OF AHMEDABAD WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW. SUBSEQUENTLY, SENSORS WERE INTEGRATED AT THE STRATEGIC GRID POINT LOCATION COVERING THE ENTIRE METRO RAIL STATION TO COLLECT REAL-TIME ILLUMINANCE FOR DAYLIGHT FACTOR CALCULATION. FURTHERMORE, BIM-BASED SUN PATH AND SHADOW ANALYSIS AND DAYLIGHT SIMULATION WERE CARRIED OUT TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY AND POTENTIAL OF DAYLIGHT SAVINGS. FINALLY, BASED ON ALL THE ANALYSIS AND RESULTS, A NEWLY DESIGNED SENSOR-BASED PROTOTYPE WAS DEVELOPED AND EQUIPPED TO ENHANCE AUTOMATED OPTIMIZATION FOR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS, WHICH RESULTED IN 29\% ENERGY SAVINGS MONTHLY. THIS APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY HELPS THE PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS TO ENHANCE BUILDING ENERGY PERFORMANCE AND LEAD A STEP CLOSER TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","PANDIT DEENDAYAL ENERGY UNIVERSITY; INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM (IIT SYSTEM); INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (IIT) - DELHI",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/15623599.2024.2306015","P3M7S","2331-2327","JAN 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1562-3599","INT.

A STUDY OF NOT ONLY THE USE OF ENERGY DURING THE OPERATION BUT ALSO THE ASSOCIATED CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS IN THE LIFE CYCLE IS REQUIRED. ONE WAY TO REDUCE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS THROUGH RETRO-FITTING EXISTING BUILDINGS. THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AFTER APPLYING FIVE SUSTAINABLE RETROFIT MEASURES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, TWO TYPICAL NEIGHBOURHOOD DWELLINGS WERE CHOSEN, LOCATED IN THE CITY OF VITORIA, IN THE STATE OF ESPIRITO SANTO, BRAZIL. THE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE PRE-OPERATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL STAGES. USING PRE-ESTABLISHED STANDARDS, THE ENERGY OF THE BUILDING MATERIALS THAT COMPOSE THE DWELLINGS WAS CALCULATED AS WELL AS THE CONSUMED OPERATIONAL ENERGY. THE LABELLING OF THE BUILDING ENVELOPES WAS ALSO VERIFIED, ACCORDING TO THE SIMULATION METHOD SPECIFIED BY THE TECHNICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY LEVELS OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (RTQ-R). THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMME USED TO CALCULATE PERFORMANCE WAS ENERGYPLUS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ADOPTING ALL RETROFIT MEASURES YIELDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIFE CYCLE FOR ONLY ONE BUILDING, NAMELY, A 15\% REDUCTION IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND A PAYBACK TIME OF 10.4 YEARS. ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE REPORTED IN SOME INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, THE ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OPERATIONAL STAGE OF BOTH BUILDINGS, IN BOTH LABELLING AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO ESPIRITO SANTO",NA,"THAIS.SARTORI@ALUNO.UFES.BR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2018.10.009","HC4FB",NA,NA,NA,"FOUNDATION FOR SUPPORT TO RESEARCH AND INNOVATION OF ESPIRITO SANTO (FAPES)","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT GRANTED BY THE FOUNDATION FOR SUPPORT TO RESEARCH AND INNOVATION OF ESPIRITO SANTO (FAPES).",NA,"2352-7102","J.

WITH RESPECT TO BUILDINGS, LCA CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF AN ENTIRE BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE. CURRENTLY LCA IN THE BUILDING AREA IS USED IN A LIMITED CAPACITY, PRIMARILY TO SELECT BUILDING PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSALITY FOR THE LACK OF WHOLE-BUILDING LCAS, FOCUS GROUPS WITH MEMBERS OF THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) COMMUNITIES WERE HELD. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE OF LCA IN THE AEC COMMUNITY AND THEN DISCUSSES THE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO THE PRACTICE OF LCA. IN SUMMARY, THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO IDENTIFY WHY LCA IS NOT USED TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL IN A WHOLE-BUILDING LCA. IN AN OPEN FORUM AND MODERATED SETTING, FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED INDIVIDUALLY TO SELF-IDENTIFY THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH LCA, A BRIEF EDUCATION SESSION ON LCA WAS HELD, AND THEN BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO LCA WERE DISCUSSED. THE FOCUS GROUP SESSIONS WERE TRANSCRIBED AND SYSTEMATICALLY CODED BY SOCIAL RESEARCHERS IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS. HYBRID FLOW AND RADAR CHARTS WERE DEVELOPED. FROM THE FOCUS GROUP RESULTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT TO LCA WAS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE RESULTS DID NOT IDENTIFY A PROMINENT BARRIER; HOWEVER, BUILDING-RELATED METRICS WERE ASCERTAINED TO BE ONE OF THE MORE CRUCIAL BARRIERS. THE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS CLASSIFIED BY THIS ANALYSIS WILL BE UTILIZED TO DEVELOP A SUBSEQUENT ONLINE SURVEY TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE LCA AND AEC COMMUNITY.","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH",NA,"MBILEC@PITT.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1111/jiec.12028","232AZ","1530-9290",NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [EFRI-1038139]; DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING; EMERGING FRONTIERS \& MULTIDISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES [1038139] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","RESEARCH FOR THIS ARTICLE WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (GRANT AWARD EFRI-1038139).

THE PRESENTED PAPER OUTLINES THE CURRENT STATE OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ON DISTRICT-SCALE BUILDING LCA IN TERMS OF STANDARDS, SOFTWARE AND CERTIFICATIONS, AND DATA AVAILABILITY. FOR THIS MATTER, THE AUTHORS PRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF TWO DISTRICT-SCALE LCA TOOLS, TECO AND DISTELCA, TO DETERMINE THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) OF THREE DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. BOTH TOOLS EMPLOY DATA BASED ON (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO) CITYGML, TABULA, AND OKOBAUDAT. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT DISTELCA'S GRANULAR APPROACH LEADS TO AN OVERESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, WHICH CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE STATISTICAL APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE AND RELATED EMISSIONS. WHILE BOTH TOOLS LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL TIME SAVINGS, TECO REQUIRES LESS MANUAL EFFORT. THE LINKAGE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DATA SOURCES HAS PROVEN LABORIOUS AND COULD BE ALLEVIATED WITH A COMMON DATA FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, LARGE-SCALE DATA ANALYSIS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE VIABILITY OF THE PRESENTED APPROACH.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY","5639","SCHILDT@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE CUYPERS@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE SHAMOVICH@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE HERZOGENRATH@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE MALHOTRA@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE TREECK@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE FRISCH@E3D.RWTH-AACHEN.DE",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/en16155639","O7GD2","1996-1073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ENERGIES","ENERGIES","ENGLISH","AUG",NA,"104","15","GOLD","SCHILDT, MAXIMILIAN/0009-0001-6078-2783 FRISCH, JEROME/0000-0003-0509-5275 CUYPERS, JOHANNES LINUS/0009-0004-6557-3851 VAN TREECK, CHRISTOPH/0000-0001-5241-035X MALHOTRA, AVICHAL/0000-0002-7225-1488 HERZOGENRATH, SONJA/0009-0003-2708-0813",NA,NA,"MDPI","ENERGY \& FUELS","FRISCH, JÉRÔME/GRJ-7245-2022 SCHILDT, MAXIMILIAN/ITV-5432-2023 ",NA,0,"ON THE POTENTIAL OF DISTRICT-SCALE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS OF BUILDINGS","ARTICLE","WOS001045441000001","7","15","16","ENERGY \& FUELS","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"SCHILDT MAXIMILIAN;CUYPERS JOHANNES LINUS;SHAMOVICH MAXIM; HERZOGENRATH SONJA TAMARA;MALHOTRA AVICHAL;VAN TREECK; CHRISTOPH ALBAN;FRISCH JEROME","FRISCH, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST ENERGY EFFICIENCY \& SUSTAINABLE BLDG E3D, D-52074 AACHEN, GERMANY","ISI","ENERGIES","FRISCH;SCHILDT;FRISCH;SCHILDT","FRISCH",NA,"SCHILDT M, 2023, ENERGIES","SCHILDT M, 2023, ENERGIES",NA

THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE INCREASINGLY BEING FELT AND RESPON-SIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION AND ADAPTION, WHICH MUST INCLUDE THE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMIS-SION IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW RESIDENTIAL STOCK. MITIGATION STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON DECREASING THE OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDINGS, LEAVING THE OTHER LIFE CYCLE STAGES, SUCH AS CONSTRUCTION, LARGELY IGNORED. TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL TARGETS, SUCH AS ZERO NET EMISSIONS BY 2050, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS MITIGATION FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT BASED ON CURRENT BUILDING PRACTICES ONE NEW DETACHED DWELLING BUILT TODAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUGHLY 545 TCO(2)E BY 2050. THIS TRANSLATES TO THE NEED TO PLANT OVER 8,000 TREES TO OFFSET THESE EMISSIONS, A FIGURE IT IS SAFE TO SAY, MOST HOMEOWNERS WILL NOT ACHIEVE. THIS STUDY MODELLED LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF ALL NEW DETACHED DWELLINGS CONSTRUCTED IN AUSTRALIA FOR A SINGLE YEAR (2019) ESTIMATING 39 MTCO(2)E, WHICH INCREASES TO 883 MTCO(2)E BY 2030 AND 3,654 MTCO(2)E BY 2050. THIS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PROJECTIONS FOR AUSTRALIA'S TOTAL EMISSIONS BY 2030 OF 563 MTCO(2)E IF A BUSINESS AS USUAL APPROACH IS FOL-LOWED, AND THE OPTIMUM TARGET OF 441 MTCO(2)E TO MEET EMISSIONS TARGETS OF 26\% LESS THAN 2005. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT HOUSING-RELATED GHG EMISSION ARE UNDERESTIMATED BY 60\%, BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF EMBODIED GHG EMISSIONS BEING COUNTED IN EMISSION PROJECTIONS. THIS EMPHASISES THAT FIRSTLY, TARGET AND CURRENT GHG EMISSION PROJECTIONS FAIL TO CONSIDER EMISSIONS FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPEC-TIVE, AND PRIMARILY REPORT FINDINGS BASED ON OPERATIONAL DATA, WHICH AS THIS STUDY HAS SHOWN CAN LEAD TO A MISREPRESENTATION OF ALMOST 96\% OF TOTAL LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS.

CONSENSUS SEEMS TO EXIST ON THE FACT THAT THE ALLOCATION PROCEDURE SHOULD FOLLOW LOGICALLY FROM THE LCA GOAL DEFINITION. THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO USE AN AXIOMATIC METHOD TO (1) IDENTIFY AN ALLOCATION PROCEDURE FOR CO-PRODUCTION, JOINT TREATMENT, AND RECYCLING, THAT BEST RESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC LCA GOAL AND (2) COMMUNICATE THE RATIONALE APPLIED BY THE LCA PRACTITIONER TRANSPARENTLY. THE METHOD IS ILLUSTRATED VIA A CASE STUDY. MATERIALS AND METHODS THE SPECIFIC GOAL DEFINITION FOR WHICH A SUITABLE ALLOCATION PROCEDURE IS IDENTIFIED IS TO EVALUATE WHAT IMPACTS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A PRODUCT, WHICH COULD INFORM A COMPANY ABOUT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF REPUTATION DAMAGE. SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS THAT REFLECT OUR VISION OF ``WHAT IMPACTS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A PRODUCT'' ARE DESCRIBED IN DEFINITIONS AND AXIOMS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION AXIOMS ARE FORMULATED THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF THE PRODUCT SYSTEM AND THE PARTITIONING CRITERION. THE DERIVED ALLOCATION PROCEDURE CORRESPONDS TO ``ALLOCATION AT THE POINT OF SUBSTITUTION,'' WHICH IS APPLIED IN ONE OF THE SYSTEM MODELS OF ECOINVENT. PARTITIONING IS BASED ON MARKET INFORMATION, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A CAUSE-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVE ON ``WHAT IMPACTS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A PRODUCT.'' OTHER LCA GOAL DEFINITIONS AND RATIONALES COULD REQUIRE DIFFERENT SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OR A DIFFERENT PARTITIONING CRITERION. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES THE AXIOMATIC METHOD PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER SUPPORTS THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SUITABLE ALLOCATION PROCEDURE FOR A DEFINED LCA GOAL AND THE TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION OF THE RATIONALE THAT BACKS UP THIS PROCEDURE. BUILDING FORTH ON THE APPROACH OF THIS PAPER, A COLLECTION OF AXIOMS AND CORRESPONDING ALLOCATION PROCEDURES COULD BE DEVELOPED ON WHICH CONSENSUS MIGHT EXIST WITHIN THE LCA COMMUNITY.

THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH SHOWS PROMISE IN ASSISTING CITIES TO ACHIEVE DECARBONIZATION GOALS, GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CARBON EMISSIONS ATTRIBUTED TO BUILDINGS IN URBAN AREAS. PRIOR EFFORTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZED URBAN BUILDING ENERGY MODELING (UBEM) TOOLS TO ASSESS CITY-SCALE BUILDING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EXPLORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCENARIOS. HOWEVER, THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) WITH UBEM, A ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT APPROACH, REMAINS UNDEREXPLORED. THE COMBINATION OF LCA AND UBEM CAN PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF A BUILDING'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, CONSIDERING ENERGY PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS BROADER CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES, AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. DESPITE THE EVIDENT BENEFITS, THERE EXISTS A RESEARCH GAP IN FULLY HARNESSING THE POTENTIAL OF INTEGRATING LCA AND UBEM METHODOLOGIES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS THUS WARRANTED TO UNLOCK THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN THESE APPROACHES, ESTABLISHING AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK THAT ENHANCES SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND INFORMS DECISION-MAKING IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CITY-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL TOOL. THIS ENTAILS DEFINING THE CHALLENGES, IDENTIFYING KEY COMPONENTS, ESTABLISHING A STRUCTURED FRAMEWORK, AND TESTING AND REFINING IT THROUGH ITERATIONS. THE DEFINED FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN MODELING TOOLS THAT OFFER A COMPATIBLE ENVIRONMENT. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTEGRATION OF LCA INTO UBEM TOOLS. FIRSTLY, A STRUCTURED PROCEDURE IS DEFINED TO FACILITATE THE SYSTEMATIC CREATION OF THE INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. THIS PROCEDURE SERVES AS A GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS TO ADOPT A COMPREHENSIVE AND ORGANIZED APPROACH IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF COMBINING LCA AND UBEM METHODOLOGIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, A WORKFLOW IS DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY IMPROVEMENT PRACTICES WITHIN THE DEFINED SYSTEMATIC PROCESS OF INTEGRATING LCA INTO UBEM TOOLS. APPLYING THE DEVELOPED WORKFLOW IN A REAL CASE STUDY IN MONTREAL, CANADA, REVEALS THAT EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS CAN ACTUALLY BE HIGHER THAN OPERATIONAL EMISSIONS, WHEN THE ENERGY SUPPLY IS RENEWABLE (HYDROPOWER). THE OUTCOMES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE STUDIES ON URBAN BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (UBEA), FACILITATING A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE THE FIELD.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY - CANADA","111662","MOHAMMAD.SEYEDABADI@MAIL.CONCORDIA.CA SOROUSH.SAMAREHABOLHASSANI@MAIL.CONCORDIA.CA URSULA.EICKER@CONCORDIA.CA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.111662","UU5J1","1873-684X","JUN 2024",NA,"CANADA EXCELLENCE RESEARCH CHAIRS PROGRAM [CERC-2018-00005]","THIS RESEARCH WAS UNDERTAKEN, IN PART, THANKS TO FUNDING FROM THE CANADA EXCELLENCE RESEARCH CHAIRS PROGRAM WITH GRANT NUMBER CERC-2018-00005.",NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY, CLASSIFY, AND PRIORITIZE THESE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES USING MIXED METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES). THIS INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE LITERARY REVIEW, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH SMES, AND USE OF THE DELPHI METHOD. A TOTAL OF 21 ADVANTAGES AND 7 DISADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH BIM-BASED LCAS WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED. THE ADVANTAGES WERE GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: DECISION MAKING, MATERIAL SELECTION, SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE, AND WASTE REDUCTION. THE DISADVANTAGES WERE GROUPED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: STANDARDIZATION AND DATA PROCESSING. THE DELPHI METHOD WAS APPLIED VIA TWO ROUNDS OF QUESTIONNAIRES WITH TEN SMES TO PRIORITIZE THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS WITH CONSTRUCTIVE INFORMATION FOR THE INTEGRATED USE OF BIM AND LCAS AND WILL CREATE AWARENESS IN THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THE IDENTIFIED DISADVANTAGES SHOW THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FUTURE WORK AND THE PRIORITY RANKINGS FOR BOTH THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES COULD BE USED BY RESEARCHERS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","OZYEGIN UNIVERSITY","106703","SENEM.SEYIS@OZYEGIN.EDU.TR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106703","LC4UB","1873-684X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF NEW BUILDINGS OR RENOVATING EXISTING BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, RENOVATING BUILDING ENVELOPES AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TO LESSEN ENERGY LOSSES IS USUALLY EXPENSIVE AND HAS A LONG PAYBACK PERIOD. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION OF THE RESEARCH ABOUT OPTIMIZING ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE RENOVATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS TO MINIMIZE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING BUILDINGS BY SELECTING THE OPTIMAL RENOVATION STRATEGIES CONSIDERING LCA. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS CAN BE COMBINED IN A BUILDING RENOVATION STRATEGY TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. EACH SCENARIO CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVEMENT OF THE BUILDING ENVELOPES, HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) SYSTEMS, AND LOCAL ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE SCENARIOS COULD BE INCONSISTENT AND SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IN THIS RESEARCH IS THE APPROPRIATE COUPLING OF RENOVATION SCENARIOS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HVAC SYSTEM MUST BE REDESIGNED WHEN RENOVATING THE BUILDING ENVELOPE TO CONSIDER THE REDUCED ENERGY DEMAND AND TO AVOID UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS. A GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) COUPLED WITH AN ENERGY SIMULATION TOOL IS USED FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY MINIMIZING THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND THE LCA OF THE BUILDING. THE SIMULATION TOOL IS USED TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR EACH POTENTIAL SOLUTION REPRESENTING ONE RENOVATION SCENARIO. THE DATA OF THE BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM). THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED USING A CASE STUDY FOCUSING ON THE BUILDINGS OF CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY.","UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA","CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY - CANADA; CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY - CANADA",NA,"SE\_SH@ENCS.CONCORDIA.CA HAMMAD@CIISE.CONCORDIA.CA",NA,"COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE","2024-12-23",NA,"BJ5RN",NA,NA,"LIN, KY AND ELGOHARY, N AND TANG, P",NA,NA,"978-0-7844-8084-7",NA,NA,"COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,"ASCE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING (IWCCE), UNIV WASHINGTON, SEATTLE, WA, JUN 25-27, 2017","19",NA,NA,NA,"AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS; AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, COMP DIV","288-295","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING",NA,NA,1,"SIMULATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION OF BUILDING RENOVATION CONSIDERING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000426216800036","0","9",NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2017,"SHARIF SEYED AMIRHOSAIN;HAMMAD AMIN","SHARIF, SA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CONCORDIA UNIV, DEPT BLDG CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, SIR GEORGE WILLIAMS CAMPUS, MONTREAL, PQ H3G 1M8, CANADA","ISI","COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE","CONCORDIA UNIV;CONCORDIA UNIV;CONCORDIA UNIV","CONCORDIA UNIV",NA,"SHARIF SA, 2017, COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE","SHARIF SA, 2017, COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 2017: SMART SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE",NA

HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF A DATA INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK AND AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD APPROACH INTEGRATING KEY DECISION VARIABLES TO SUPPORT SCIENTIFIC COMPUTATIONS AND DECISION-MAKING FOR WHOLE-LIFE-CYCLE NET-ZERO-CARBON BUILDINGS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) IS AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD REPRESENTING BUILDING INFORMATION. DIGITAL TWIN (DT) CAN CAPTURE AND MONITOR REAL-TIME BUILDING CONDITIONS TO FACILITATE BUILDING OPERATION. INTEGRATING INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY DT WITH BIM HAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BASED COMPUTATIONAL REPRESENTATION OF KEY DECISION VARIABLES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE-BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PROCESS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT INTEGRATES BIM AND DT TO SUPPORT NET-ZERO-CARBON BUILDINGS. THE FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED USING AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD APPROACH AND THE ONTOLOGY-BASED REPRESENTATION METHOD, TO DEFINE KEY DECISION VARIABLES USING ENTITIES, PROPERTIES, AND RELATIONSHIPS, AND INTEGRATES CAPTURED DATA VIA DT.

ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY, IF THE GLOBAL POPULATION GROWS TO 9.3 BILLION BY 2050, NEW INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE APPROXIMATELY 350 GT OF CO2 EMISSIONS, CORRESPONDING TO 35-60\% OF THE REMAINING CARBON BUDGET AVAILABLE UP TO 2050 IF THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE INCREASE IS TO BE LIMITED TO 2 \& DEG;C. MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION IS ONE WAY TO REDUCE EMBODIED ENERGY AND CO2 EMISSIONS. CROSS-LAMINATED TIMBER (CLT), A BIO-BASED MATERIAL, CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONCRETE AND STEEL, WHICH ARE THE MOST ENERGY-AND CARBON-INTENSIVE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE IMMEDIATE APPLICATION OF CLT TO THE ENTIRE BUILDING. THIS STUDY CONFIRMED GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSION AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION REDUCTIONS WHEN CLT WAS APPLIED TO THE EXTERIOR WALLS OF 52 APARTMENT BUILDING TYPES. SUBSTITUTING CLT FOR CONCRETE IN THE EXTERIOR WALLS RESULTED IN A 44.6\% SAVINGS IN GHG EMISSIONS AND 49.3\% IN ENERGY DEMAND. GHG EMISSIONS PER FLOOR WERE REDUCED BY-16,906 KG CO2-EQ, WHILE ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER FLOOR WAS REDUCED BY-256,896 MJ. IF CLT IS USED IN 30\% OF THE EXTERIOR WALLS OF THE 800,000 HOUSES PLANNED TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN SEOUL BY 2030, THE ENERGY SAVINGS AND GHG REDUCTION EFFECT ARE EXPECTED TO BE-11,495 TJ AND-0.86 MT CO2-EQ, RESPECTIVELY.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","YONSEI UNIVERSITY; GYEONGSANG NATIONAL UNIVERSITY; SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","113604","KIMSUMIN@YONSEI.AC.KR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.rser.2023.113604","Q1OO8","1879-0690","AUG 2023",NA,"KOREA FOREST SERVICE (KOREA FORESTRY PROMOTION INSTITUTE) [2022466C10-2324-0201]; KOREA FOREST SERVICE (KOREA FORESTRY PROMOTION INSTITUTE)","THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF R \& D PROGRAM FOR FOREST SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY (PROJECT NO.''2022466C10-2324-0201 ?) ` PROVIDED BY KOREA FOREST SERVICE (KOREA FORESTRY PROMOTION INSTITUTE) .",NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

ONE WIDELY RECOGNIZED METHOD THAT SUPPORTS ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE IS THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA), WHICH ENABLES A HOLISTIC, QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS. THE INTEGRATION OF THIS METHOD IN DIGITAL DESIGN TOOLS SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) FACILITATES ITS USE DURING THE BUILDING DESIGN STAGES. HOWEVER, DATA GRANULARITY IS NOT THE SAME IN EVERY DESIGN STAGE, AND CONSEQUENTLY DATA CONSISTENCY CANNOT BE ASSURED. HENCE, THE MARGIN OF UNEXPECTED VARIATION OF THE RESULTS SHALL BE AVOIDED AND ROBUST RESULTS FROM THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES SHOULD BE OBTAINED. DURING THE EARLY STAGE, THE LEVEL OF DETAILS IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE ELEMENT DEFINITION, WHILE DURING THE DETAILED STAGES, THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE BUILDING INCREASED. THIS PAPER AIMS TO FILL IN THE INFORMATIONAL GAPS DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE AND ALIGN THOSE RESULTS WITH A DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DEVELOPED FOR COST ESTIMATION DURING THE DETAILED STAGES. THUS, BASED ON A CASE STUDY ANALYSIS, WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE METHOD BY DETERMINING THE VARIATION OF MATERIAL QUANTITIES AND COMPARING THE LCSA INVENTORY INDICATORS DURING THE EARLY AND DETAILED STAGES. THIS METHOD CAN ESTIMATE MORE THAN 60\% OF THE LCSA INVENTORY INDICATORS DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE AND THE TOTAL RESULTS DURING DETAILED DESIGN STAGE.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA; UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA; GRAZ UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","103516","BSOUST@US.ES",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103516","XB6HA","2352-7102","NOV 2021",NA,"UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLE; VI PLAN PROPIO DE INVESTIGACION [VIPPIT-2021-I.3]; [BIA2017-84830-R]","THE AUTHORS THANK GABRIEL VERD ARQUITECTOS AND EMVISESA TO PROVIDE THE NEEDED INFORMATION TO USE THE BUILDING CASE STUDY.

HOWEVER, THE LITERATURE PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT THE QUANTIFICATION AND GENERALIZATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF WOOD DURING THE WHOLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE CAN BE DIFFICULT. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A QUANTITATIVE METHOD BASED ON LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TO COMPARE, DURING THEIR DESIGN STAGES, THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS PRODUCED BY A TIMBER-FRAME SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE VERSUS THOSE OF A CONCRETE-MASONRY-BASED HOUSE BUILT IN URUGUAY. THE METHOD, CONCEIVED AS A DECISION-ORIENTED TOOL, INTEGRATES BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AND LCA TO QUANTIFY AND COMPARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ONE OF THE MOST COMMON DWELLING TYPOLOGIES IN URUGUAY. THE RESULTS OF THE CRADLE-TO-GRAVE ASSESSMENT SHOW THAT THE TIMBER-FRAME BUILDING PRODUCED THE LOWEST IMPACTS IN GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, HUMAN TOXICITY, ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, OZONE DEPLETION POTENTIAL, AND FRESHWATER ECOTOXICITY, BUT YIELDED THE HIGHEST IMPACTS IN EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THE METHOD DEVELOPED HEREIN FACILITATED THE COMPARISON AND CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PROS AND CONS OF BOTH DESIGN OPTIONS DURING THEIR DESIGN STAGES. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLUTIONS OF A MORE SUSTAINABLE NATURE TO REDUCE AND MITIGATE THIS SITUATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY URGENT. TO THIS END, THE INTEGRATION OF MULTI-DIMENSION AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT INTO THE DESIGN PROCESS OF BUILDINGS CAN HELP AND SUPPORT DECISION MAKING. LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA) IS ONE OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY'S MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED METHODOLOGIES FOR THIS PURPOSE, COMBINING THE EVALUATION OF THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS (TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE). ONE OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO IMPLEMENTING THIS METHODOLOGY LIES IN THE DIFFICULTIES IN AUTOMATICALLY COMPARING ALTERNATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS FOR THE SELECTION OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED THE BIM3LCA (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING THREE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT) TOOL CONCEIVED TO GUIDE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STEPS. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) PLUG-IN DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATES ITS APPLICATION IN A CASE STUDY TO SUPPORT THE MULTI-CRITERIA BUILDING MATERIAL SELECTION BASED ON THE LCSA IMPLEMENTATION AT THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE. THREE BUILDING MATERIAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM OF A MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING ARE EMPLOYED TO VALIDATE THIS PLUG-IN. THE RESULTS SHOW THE VIABILITY OF USING THIS TOOL DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES AND DEMONSTRATES THE CONSISTENCY OF THE RESULTS REGARDING THE USE OF THE BIM MODEL TO CONDUCT THE LCSA. THE STUDY DISCUSSES THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE BIM3LCA TOOL.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE WASTE CAPACITY OF THE SELECTED DISTRICT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE CURRENT WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICY VIA LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE TWO INDICATORS; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND ENERGY FLOW. THE DISTRICT HAS 82 BUILDINGS WITH 64,971M2 TOTAL GROSS AREA AND 2,000 POPULATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE DISTRICT'S WASTE CAPACITY WAS EVALUATED WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES (MSW), LIQUID WASTES, AND DEMOLITION WASTES. THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF THE LCA WERE SET BASED ON THE GATE-TO-GRAVE APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES GENERATED WASTES DURING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BUILDINGS, INCLUDING THEIR END-OF-LIFE STAGE. CONSEQUENTLY, ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIALS FROM WASTE PROCESSES WERE INVESTIGATED AND COMPARED WITH THE PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND OF THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE BUILDINGS TO PERCEIVE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY COMPENSATION RANGE. ADDITIONALLY, BUILDINGS' PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, WHICH OBTAINED FROM THEIR BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS (BIM), ENERGY PERFORMANCES, DERIVED FROM THEIR ENERGY MODELS AND LOCAL SPECIFICATIONS, OBTAINED FROM STANDARDS WERE UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY THE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. CRITICALLY, THE OUTCOMES OF ALL THOSE WERE USED AS INPUT DATA FOR THE LCA MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE HAD BEEN ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIALS FROM MSW'S TREATMENTS, WHILE LIQUID WASTES AND DEMOLISHING WASTES TREATMENTS HAVE CONSUMED ENERGY. ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIAL FROM MSW HAS COMPENSATED ONLY 5.8\% OF OPERATIONAL ENERGY ANNUALLY, WHICH CAME FROM RECYCLING PROCESSES. ALSO, ALL WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS RELEASE GREENHOUSE GASES TO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

SPECIFICALLY, CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES FACILITATE THE BUILDING OF INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TERMS BY EXPLOITING SIMILARITIES OF CONCEPTS. WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE WEB, ONLINE INFORMATION HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAJOR INFORMATION SOURCES. THE ONTOLOGY LEARNING PROCESS WHERE TRADITIONAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS ARE INVOLVED TENDS TO BE SLOW AND COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE WHEN THE DATASET IS AS LARGE AS THE WEB. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PRESENT AN EFFICIENT CONCEPT CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE FOR ONTOLOGY LEARNING THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED PAIRWISE TERM SIMILARITY COMPUTATIONS WITHOUT A LOSS OF QUALITY. OUR APPROACH IS TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT TERMS USING A COMPUTATIONALLY INEXPENSIVE SIMILARITY METRIC BASED ON AN EVENT LIFE CYCLE IN ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES. THEN, WE PERFORM MORE SOPHISTICATED SIMILARITY COMPUTATIONS. HENCE, WE CAN BUILD CLUSTERS WITH HIGH PRECISION/RECALL AND HIGH SPEED. WITHOUT A LOSS OF CLUSTERING QUALITY, OUR FRAMEWORK REDUCES THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED COMPUTATIONS FROM O(N-2) TO (N + L-2) (L << N) WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATE CONCEPTS. OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT CLUSTERING BASED ON OUR SIMILARITY FRAMEWORK CAN CONSTRUCT CONCEPT CLUSTERS 1541.07\% FASTER THAN CLUSTERING WITH ALL TERM PAIR SIMILARITY COMPUTATIONS.","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","GOOGLE INCORPORATED; YAHOO!

BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING HELPED TO QUANTIFY THE REQUIRED BUILDING MATERIALS. DYNAMIC BUILDING SIMULATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN DESIGNBUILDER TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY DEMAND OF THE BUILDING FOR THE OPERATIONAL PERIOD. TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY AND THE CARBON BALANCE OF THE BUILDING, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING WERE USED. A HEAT AND MOISTURE TRANSFER SIMULATION WAS CARRIED OUT TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ANALYSIS AND TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE MOISTURE PROBLEMS.THE ASSESSMENT SHOWED THAT THE RATIO OF EMBODIED IMPACTS AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS IS TYPICALLY 1:2 FOR WOODEN BUILDINGS AND 1:1.5 FOR BRICK BUILDINGS. LIFE CYCLE CARBON NEUTRALITY COULD BE ACHIEVED IN BOTH CASES WITH ADDITIONAL PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS INSTALLED ON THE ROOF. HOWEVER, A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TIMBER AND BRICK BUILDINGS IS THE TIME FACTOR: WHILE THE INITIAL EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF BRICK BUILDINGS ARE GRADUALLY OFFSET WITH EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY, TIMBER BUILDINGS ACT AS CARBON STORAGE WITH NEGATIVE EMISSIONS OVER THE STUDY PERIOD AND THE CARBON IS ONLY RELEASED AT THE EVENTUAL END -OF-LIFE STAGE. THE NECESSARY SIZE OF PHOTOVOLTAICS IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY THE AVOIDED GRID IMPACT: IF DYNAMIC DECARBONIZATION OF THE ELECTRICITY MIX IS CONSIDERED, THE SIZE OF PHOTOVOLTAICS REQUIRED IS ABOUT 1.5 TIMES LARGER TO OFFSET THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD OF THE CONSTRUCTION DUE TO THE DIMINISHING BENEFITS.(C) 2022 THE AUTHOR(S).

TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY, THE CONCEPT OF A SUCCESSFUL BUILDING PROJECT SHOULD BE APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF A PROJECT'S LIFECYCLE. ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) HAS BEEN LACKING TO A LARGE EXTENT IN DEVELOPING NATIONS, A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON BIM USAGE, AWARENESS, BARRIERS AND DRIVERS. HOWEVER, NO RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON THE IMPACT OF THE BIM BARRIERS ONBIM USAGE FREQUENCY IN THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE. THE RESEARCH ASSESSES THE EXTENT OF INFLUENCE OF OVERCOMING BIM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS (BIMIBS) ON THE BIM USAGE FREQUENCY (BF) AT THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. THE STUDY CREATED A CONCEPTUAL MODEL BASED ON A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW AFTER WHICH, A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WHICH COLLECTED DATA FROM 103 PROFESSIONALS IN THE GHANAIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS USED TO PERFORM A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) ANALYSIS. THE STRUCTURAL MODEL ADAPTED 14 ATTRIBUTES ACROSS 4 MAJOR BIMIBS NAMELY ORGANIZATIONAL (OB), COST (CB), TECHNICAL (TB) AND PEOPLE (PB) RELATED BARRIERS AS WELL AS 7 ATTRIBUTES ACROSS 3 PHASE FACTORS NAMELY THE PRECONSTRUCTION (UP), CONSTRUCTION (UC) AND POST CONSTRUCTION (UPC) PHASES. IN ORDER OF SIGNIFICANCE, THE STUDY IDENTIFIED TB, PB, OB AND CB AS THE MOST CRITICAL BIM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS THAT REQUIRE URGENT ATTENTION IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WITH PATH COEFFICIENT VALUES OF 0.359, 0.314, 0.238 AND 0.199 RESPECTIVELY. ALSO, WITH A PATH COEFFICIENT VALUE OF 0.848, THE PLS-SEM RESULTS REVEALED A POSITIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OF `OVERCOMING BIMIBS(U)' ON BIM USAGE(U) IN THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE AMONG PROFESSIONALS IN THE AEC INDUSTRY OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY DISCOVERED THAT, BF AT UP RANKED FIRST FOLLOWED BY UC AND UPC WITH SCORES OF 0.894, 0.855 AND 0.803 RESPECTIVELY. LASTLY, THE CONCEPTUAL, EMPIRICAL, MANAGERIAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL PREDICTION WERE EXAMINED. INCREASING THE DELIVERY OF WASTE-EFFICIENT BIM-ENABLED PROJECTS WITHIN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT BY OVERCOMING THE IDENTIFIED CRITICAL BIMIBS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY TO THE IDEA OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY'S FINDINGS WILL SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR RESEARCHERS, PROFESSIONALS, AND ACADEMICS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AS THEY WORK TO OVERCOME BIM BARRIERS AND TO PROMOTE BIM USAGE THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","SOUTHEAST UNIVERSITY - CHINA","113329","GEORGINAANNAN@OUTLOOK.COM ZHANGH555@ALIYUN.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113329","M7YU0","1872-6178","JUL 2023",NA,"RESEARCH ON PARTS AND COMPONENTS LIBRARY AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL SUB-PART, CODING AND LABELING STANDARDS [2022-K-069]","THE RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RESEARCH ON PARTS AND COMPONENTS LIBRARY AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL SUB-PART, CODING AND LABELING STANDARDS (2022-K-069) .",NA,"0378-7788","ENERGY BUILD.","ENERGY AND BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","SEP 15",NA,"123",NA,"BRONZE",NA,NA,NA,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY \& FUELS; ENGINEERING",NA,NA,17,"ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF OVERCOMING BIM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS ON BIM USAGE FREQUENCY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE USING PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) ANALYSIS","ARTICLE","WOS001032342900001","5","32","295","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY \& FUELS; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2023,"TAKYI-ANNAN GEORGINA ESI;ZHANG HONG","TAKYI-ANNAN, GE; ZHANG, H (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), SOUTHEAST UNIV, SCH ARCHITECTURE, 90 CHENGXIAN ST, NANJING 210096, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","ENERGY BUILD","SOUTHEAST UNIV;SOUTHEAST UNIV","NOTREPORTED;SOUTHEAST UNIV",NA,"TAKYI-ANNAN GE, 2023, ENERGY BUILD","TAKYI-ANNAN GE, 2023, ENERGY BUILD",NA

THIS ARTICLE ASSESSED A LIGHTWEIGHT PREFABRICATED HOUSE FOR SEVEN HOUSE LOCATIONS (ADDRESSING TRANSPORT, CLIMATE, AND ELECTRICITY MIX), THREE INSULATION LEVELS, AND TWO HEAT PUMPS. A LIFE CYCLE MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR A PREFABRICATED ONE-BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A STEEL STRUCTURE, ADDRESSING MATERIALS, TRANSPORT TO PLANT, MODULAR PREFABRICATION, TRANSPORT TO SITE, ONSITE ASSEMBLAGE, AND USE STAGE. A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) WAS INTEGRATED WITH THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL TO OBTAIN THE BILL OF MATERIALS, PERFORM THE ENERGY SIMULATION, AND BUILD THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY. THIS COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT INCLUDES ABIOTIC RESOURCE DEPLETION, ABIOTIC DEPLETION OF FOSSIL FUELS, GLOBAL WARMING, OZONE LAYER DEPLETION, PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION, ACIDIFICATION, EUTROPHICATION, AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY CATEGORIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT EMBODIED IMPACTS FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN AND TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANT (UP TO 60\%) FOR MOST IMPACT CATEGORIES.

WHILE THE USE OF BIM BEGINS TO SHOW ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION, IT DOES NOT SATISFY YET LINEAR INFRASTRUCTURE DOMAIN. ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS TO MANAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT DATA AROUND A COMMON INFORMATION SYSTEM, AS DEFINED BY THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (PLM) DEFINITION. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THE COMBINED USE OF PLM AND BIM FOR LINEAR INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS SUCH AS ROADS AND RAILWAYS. THE ADVENT OF NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS DIGITAL TWIN, IS PROMOTING INDUSTRIAL DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. EFFECTIVE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT MUST NOW CONSIDER ALL PHASES OF THE PROJECT, ESPECIALLY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O\&M), WHERE THE USE OF THE 3D MODEL IS NO LONGER THE DIGITAL MODEL, BUT THE DIGITAL DUPLICATE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO FACILITATE THE DIGITAL TRANSITION WHEN PROJECTS ARE SPLIT INTO SEVERAL PHASES, THE LINEAR INFRASTRUCTURE MUST BE REPRESENTED BY ONE AND ONLY ONE DIGITAL TWIN DURING ITS LIFE CYCLE.

THIS PAPER UNDERTAKES AN APPLICATION OF AN INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SET IN THE SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (S-LCIA) OF A PUBLIC BUILDING PROJECT. THIS WORK PROPOSES TO COMBINE AN INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SET (IFS) WITH MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING IN CONVERTING QUALITATIVE DATA INTO QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE BUILDING PROJECT. THIS RESEARCH UTILISES IFS TO ACCOMMODATE AND HANDLE EXPERTS' IMPRECISE COGNITIONS IN S-LCIA TO FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITISATION OF THE MOST PRESSING INDICATORS ACCOMPANYING SOCIAL IMPACTS IN A PROJECT.METHODSDATA WERE COLLECTED USING QUESTIONNAIRE(S), STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, AND THROUGH TARGETED FOCUS GROUP SESSIONS. INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SET (IFS) APPROACH WAS USED TO MODEL THE OBTAINED DATA FROM STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. USING IFS, THIS RESEARCH ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR MISSING OR AMBIGUOUS DATA THAT EMERGED DURING THE DATA ELICITATION PROCESS. IN COMBINING IFS WITH MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING TECHNIQUES, THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF SELECTED STAKEHOLDERS WERE EVALUATED USING FUZZY SET AND IFS APPROACHES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS THEN USED TO TEST THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS AND RANKING WAS CONDUCTED BASED ON EACH SOCIAL STAKEHOLDER SUBCATEGORY.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRESULTS REVEALED THAT APPROXIMATELY 23\% OF MISSING DATAPOINTS IN THE PUBLIC CASE STUDY BUILDING WERE INCORPORATED IN THE S-LCIA USING IFS. THE ISSUES OF HIGHEST PRIORITY IN EACH OF THE CONSIDERED SUBCATEGORY IN THE PUBLIC CASE STUDY BUILDING PROJECT ACCORDING TO IFS ARE (I) CONSUMER PRIVACY BY ADOPTING MORE FUNCTIONAL PLANNING (0.27), (II) PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY (0.33), AND (III) EDUCATION PROVIDED IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BY HAVING AN INDIGENOUS BOTANICAL ELEMENT FOR CHILDREN (0.39), RESPECTIVELY. CONVERSELY, THE FS TECHNIQUE INFERRED THAT THE ISSUE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THE CONSUMER STAKEHOLDER IS THE FEEDBACK MECHANISM (0.26). THE OVERALL DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN THE IFS AND FS IS ONLY 0.234, REVEALING THAT IFS PROVIDES A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM CONVENTIONAL FS WHEN USED IN MODELLING SOCIAL DATA.CONCLUSIONTHE IFS METHOD PROVIDES AN OBJECTIVE AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR DEALING WITH A HETEROGENEOUS SCOPE OF IMPRECISE AND INEXACT SOCIAL DATA IN ACHIEVING HOLISTIC SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, EXPANSIVE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT WOULD RELY ON A ROBUST APPROACH FOR IMPROVING SOCIAL WELL-BEING IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS, THEREBY LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND IN ACCOMPLISHING A SUSTAINABLE WORLD.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","DEAKIN UNIVERSITY",NA,"OLUBUKOLA.TOKEDE@DEAKIN.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1007/s11367-024-02384-w","J8B4E","1614-7502","OCT 2024",NA,"DEAKIN UNIVERSITY","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK OF THE SPECIAL ISSUE EDITORS - PROFESSOR MARZIA TRAVERSO AND DR-ING ROSE MANKAA.

THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEVELOP A LCST THAT FACILITATES A DYNAMIC VISUALISATION OF LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS AND ALLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED BENCHMARK ACROSS THE DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE STUDY LEVERAGES THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH STRATEGY IN ACCOMPLISHING A DYNAMIC AND NOVEL COMMUNICATION PLATFORM. A LIFE CYCLE THINKING METHODOLOGY AND APPROPRIATE MULTICRITERIA DECISION APPROACH (MCDA) IS APPLIED TO ACCOMPLISH A COMPREHENSIVE, STREAMLINED AND REPLICABLE APPROACH IN MAPPING AND TRACKING THE PROGRESS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) IN THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PIPELINE (NIP) PROJECTS IN INDIA.FINDINGSIT WAS FOUND THAT: (1) THE USE OF THE LCST TRACKER PROVIDES A DYNAMIC AND HOLISTIC INSIGHT INTO THE KEY LCSA INDICATORS WITH CLEARLY DEFINED BENCHMARKS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON THE SDG 11, (2) THE NIP PROJECTS ACHIEVE AN UPWARD TREND ACROSS ALL THE REGIONS, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES RANGES FROM 11 TO 24\%, WITH THE SOUTH EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST GROWTH AND THE NORTH HAVING THE MINIMAL INCREASE IN PERCENTAGE AND (3) THE ASSESSMENT SCORE (52-58\%) PROVIDES PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT ALIGN WELL WITH THE LCST - WHICH RANGES BETWEEN ``FAIR'' AND ``AVERAGE'' FOR ALL THE REGIONS IN INDIA.ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE NOVELTY OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT THE LCST PROVIDES A TRANSPARENT AND HARMONISED APPROACH TO REPORTING ON THE LCSA RESULTS. THE LCST UTILISES HEAT MAPS AND RADIAL MAPPING TO ACHIEVE AN INTUITIVE DISPLAY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS DATA, THUS ALLOWING THE SYNTHESIS OF LARGE SETS OF INFORMATION COMPACTLY AND WITH COHERENCE. PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SDGS CHANGE ON A YEARLY BASIS; HENCE, A DYNAMIC LCSA TOOL PROVIDES A TIMELY AND THE VALUABLE CONTEXT TO MAP AND TRACK PERFORMANCE ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS AND CONTEXTS.","FLOOR 5, NORTHSPRING 21-23 WELLINGTON STREET, LEEDS, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","DEAKIN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY",NA,"OLUBUKOLA.TOKEDE@DEAKIN.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1108/ECAM-07-2023-0680","GJ0H7","1365-232X","JAN 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0969-9988","ENG.

NONETHELESS, ENHANCING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION THROUGH TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS SUCH AS ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS (ESS) IS GETTING HIGHER IMPORTANCE TO INCREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF PV PLANTS, BY MINIMIZING THE BUILDING-GRID INTERACTION. IN THIS CONTEXT, ANALYZING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT ENERGY STORAGE CONFIGURATIONS BECOMES MORE RELEVANT AND CRUCIAL IN BUILDING ENERGY MODELING ALTHOUGH IT IS HEAVILY TIME-CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED, PARTICULARLY WITHIN A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION RELATED TO THE ESS DESIGN. AS A SOLUTION TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE ACCURACY, TRAINING, AND PREDICTION SPEED OF 24 MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODELS TO BE USED AS SURROGATE MODELS FOR ANALYZING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN SMART BUILDINGS. FURTHERMORE, THE PERFORMANCE OF SHORT-TERM THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE (TES) TO INCREASE PV SELF -CONSUMPTION IS ASSESSED AND PRESENTED USING ML MODELS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION (GPR), NEURAL NETWORKS (NN) INCLUDING BILAYERED AND TRILAYERED NN MODELS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) INCLUDING THE FINE GAUSSIAN AND CUBIC SVM MODELS, AND ENSEMBLES OF TREES (EOT) AS SUPERIOR ML MODELS. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEALED THAT TES SYSTEMS CAN EFFICIENTLY INCREASE PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN THE BUILDING EQUIPPED WITH ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS TO PROVIDE HEATING, COOLING, AND DOMESTIC HOT WATER. MOREOVER, THE TES SIZE OPTIMIZATION REGARDING THE LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) SHOWED THAT THE LCC-BASED OPTIMUM TES SIZE CAN YIELD 7.1\% SAVINGS WITHIN 30 YEARS OF THE BUILDING SERVICE LIFE. THE NOVELTIES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE FIRST TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO SELECT THE MOST SUITABLE ML MODELS IN PREDICTING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION, SECOND TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF SHORT-TERM THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE TO ENHANCE PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS, AND THIRD TO CARRY OUT AN LCC-BASED OPTIMIZATION ON TES SIZE USING ML-BASED PREDICTION MODELS.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF MILAN","120648","HASHEM.AMINI@POLIMI.IT",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120648","C6TT7","1872-9118","JAN 2023",NA,"EU RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME HORIZON 2020 [768921 - HEART]; EUROPEAN COMMISSION","THIS STUDY AND PROJECT ARE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY EU RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME HORIZON 2020 THROUGH NUMBER 768921 - HEART.

IN PARTICULAR, JAPANESE BUILDINGS, WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO RECENT EXTREME CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS AND NATURAL DISASTERS, ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE INDOOR THERMAL COMFORT, EVEN UNDER VARIOUS SITUATIONS. FOR THIS REASON, RECENT HVAC\&R-SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE FLEXIBLY CHANGED ACCORDING TO VARIOUS SITUATIONS. FURTHERMORE, DEMANDS FOR HVAC\&R-SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DIVERSIFYING IN RESPONSE TO ADVANCES IN WORK STYLES AND IT SYSTEMS, IMPROVEMENTS IN BUILDING PERFORMANCE, AND USER DEMANDS. IN ORDER TO OPTIMALLY PLAN AND OPERATE SUCH A COMPLEX HVAC\&R-SYSTEM, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PERFORM COMMISSIONING IN EACH LIFE-CYCLE PHASE OF DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE OPERATION METHOD OF THE HVAC\&R-SYSTEM EASY TO UNDERSTAND, TO CONVEY IT TO BUILDING USERS. IN RECENT YEARS, VIRTUAL VISUALIZATION OF BUILDING MODELS HAS BEEN RAPIDLY DEVELOPED BY BIM, WHICH CAN UNIFY INFORMATION FROM DESIGN TO CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION. IN JAPAN, IT IS USED FROM DESIGN THROUGH CONSTRUCTION, AND IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SOUGHT TO USE IT AS AN OPERATION TOOL, TO COMMUNICATE THE DESIGN INTENT. IN THIS PAPER, A CASE STUDY OF A TENANT OFFICE BUILDING IN TOKYO IS DESCRIBED, WHERE COMMISSIONING FROM THE DESIGN STAGE TO THE OPERATION STAGE WAS PERFORMED.

IT DEPENDS UPON SEVERAL INTERACTIVE DESIGN FACTORS AND CLIMATIC DIVERSITY. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS A LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) INVOLVING OPERATIONAL THERMAL EFFICIENCY WITH EMBODIED PRODUCTION. YET UPGRADING THE THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF WINDOWS AND COST OF ENERGY SAVINGS SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED FROM THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT COST. THEREFORE, THE STUDY PRESENTS A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR OPTIMIZING THE WINDOWS SYSTEM INTEGRATING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY WITH COMPREHENSIVE LCA AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC). THE STUDY EMPLOYED ENERGY SIMULATION SOFTWARE FIRSTRATE5 OVER A RANGE OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT WINDOWS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL DESIGN VARIABLES FOR ENERGY EXPENDITURE. PERFORMED SIMULATIONS ILLUSTRATE THE DOMINANCE OF FACADE INSULATION (R) ABOVE GLAZING IN REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION, ROUGHLY 87\% OF THE CUMULATIVE REDUCTION. HOWEVER, THE PROVISION OF A ZERO WINDOW IS NOT AN OPTIMUM SOLUTION FOR PERMITTING DAYLIGHT AND FRESH AIR. THUS, AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR GLAZING TO ENSURE THERMAL EFFICIENCY, LOWER EMBODIED IMPACTS, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS. THE RESULTING PEARSON COEFFICIENT (R) SHOWS A RELATIVELY HIGHER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY (UW = 0.39) CORRELATION WITH ENERGY CONSUMPTIONS IN A COLDER CLIMATE THAN HOT- AND WARM-TEMPERATE ENVIRONMENTS. THOUSANDS OF SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED TO GENERATE DATA FOR DEVELOPING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. IN ADDITION, MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THE UNCERTAINTIES OF DEVELOPED MODELS. LCC ANALYSIS SPECIFIES THE PROVISION OF GLAZING 40-68\% OF THE WINDOW TO WALL RATIO (WWR) FEASIBLE FOR OPTIMAL TRADE-OFFS. BIM-ENABLED LCA (TALLY) IDENTIFIES EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR ALUMINIUM, TIMBER, FIBERGLASS, UPVC, AND COMPOSITE FRAME WINDOWS FOLLOWING THE ISO 14040-14044 STANDARDS. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FRAMED WINDOWS SHOWS THE SUITABILITY OF USING UPVC WINDOWS OVER OTHERS DUE TO LESS COST, THERMAL EFFICIENCY, FEWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, RECYCLING POSSESSIONS, AND LESS ENERGY DEMAND AT THE MANUFACTURING STAGE.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (RMIT)","129936","MUHAMMED.BHUIYAN@RMIT.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129936","0G6TE","1879-1786",NA,NA,"SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (CIVIL \& INFRASTRUCTURE) , RMIT UNIVERSITY, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (CIVIL \& INFRASTRUCTURE) , RMIT UNIVERSITY, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, FOR PROVIDING THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THIS RESEARCH.

THE CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK DEFINES A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF SKILL BUILDING BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS THAT CAN SPEED LEARNING FOR COMPANIES WITH LESS MATURE PROGRAMS. BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREMENTALLY EXPAND THE SPAN OF CONCERN FROM COMPANY OBJECTIVES, TO VALUE CHAIN VIABILITY, AND ULTIMATELY TO SOCIETAL NEEDS, WHILE BROADENING THE BASE OF INFORMATION AND ENGAGING A WIDER SET OF STAKEHOLDER VIEWS. THE UNEP/SETAC SPONSORED PILOT TESTS OF THE LCM CMM IN CAMEROON, UGANDA, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, AND PERU. THE RESULTS FROM THE PILOT CONDUCTED BY SECRETARIA DISTRITAL DE AMBIENTE (SDA) AND A NETWORK OF 22 COMPANIES IN BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, ARE PRESENTED TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE CAPABILITY APPROACH CAN BE APPLIED AND HIGHLIGHT LESSONS LEARNED TO PROMOTE FURTHER DISSEMINATION OF LIFE CYCLE PRACTICES. THE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO APPLY THE CONCEPTS TO DEVELOP ACCURATE, REPRESENTATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL MATURITY AND TO IDENTIFY REASONABLE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT DELIVERED SOME FINANCIAL VALUE IN THE SHORT TERM, ADDRESSED A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GAP IDENTIFIED IN THE MATURITY ASSESSMENT, AND COULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE SCHEDULE DEADLINE OF THE CONTRACT (6 TO 9 MONTHS). THE PROJECTS INCLUDED AN LCA OF CLEANING PRODUCTS, COLLABORATION AMONG THREE COMPANIES TO FIND A BETTER SOLUTION FOR MANAGING A WASTE STREAM OF COFFEE ``SILVER SKINS,'' A STREAMLINED ASSESSMENT OF ACRYLIC PRODUCTS, AN LCA OF DISPOSABLE POLYPROPYLENE (PP) AND POLYSTYRENE (PS) CUPS, AND A QUALITATIVE SCREENING OF OPERATIONS OF A TRANSIT COMPANY. THE PAPER DISCUSSES HOW THE RESULTS OF THE STUDIES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF EACH COMPANY. THE PILOT PROJECTS SHOWED THAT THE CAPABILITY MATURITY APPROACH HAD INTUITIVE APPEAL AND THE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO APPLY THE CONCEPTS TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS WITH LIMITED TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WITH LC RELEVANCE. THIS SUGGESTS THERE SHOULD BE LESS EMPHASIS ON LCA AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS AND MORE AS A METHOD TO GAIN INSIGHTS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS-RELEVANT PROJECTS.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEFINE A MODEL FOR EXTENDING EXISTING COST DATABASES TO ACCOMMODATE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT. FOR THIS, CURRENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE REVIEWED AND A CASE STUDY HAS BEEN ANALYSED USING THE NEW APPROACH. TO THIS END, A NEW SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION OF CONSTRUCTION INFORMATION IS PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION OF EARLY DESIGN COSTS, WHEN DATA ARE SCARCE AND THE ONLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE REFERS TO THE GROSS INTERIOR AREA AND THE PLOT. THE CLASSIFICATION ORGANIZES THE COSTS IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT IN EN-15643. A SUBCATEGORY HAS BEEN ADDED FOR REVENUE, DEVELOPER COSTS, AND TAXES AT ALL STAGES OF THE LIFECYCLE. THE RESULTING CLASSIFICATION IS APPLIED TO THE FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS OF A SECONDARY SCHOOL PROJECT. IN THE CASE STUDY, CONSTRUCTION COSTS REPRESENT 21\% WHILE THE USE STAGE ACCOUNTS FOR 72\% IN A 100-YEAR LIFESPAN. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, STARTING FROM GENERIC COST BASES, MORE COMPLEX COSTS AND FUNCTIONAL COSTS CAN BE DEFINED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE AND ADJUSTED TO SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA; UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA","1119","EVAZQUEZ6@US.ES JAIMESOLIS@US.ES MADELYN@US.ES",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings14041119","OV0R8","2075-5309",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","APR",NA,"47","4","GOLD","VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ, EDUARDO/0000-0002-3071-8959 MARRERO, MADELYN/0000-0002-9509-4374 SOLIS-GUZMAN, JAIME/0000-0001-5535-8112",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","VÁZQUEZ-LÓPEZ, EDUARDO/M-9602-2018 MARRERO, MADELYN/N-9723-2013 SOLIS-GUZMAN, JAIME/E-5973-2011",NA,1,"A WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE FOR ESTIMATING BUILDING LIFE CYCLE COST ALIGNED WITH SUSTAINABLE ASSESSMENT-APPLICATION TO FUNCTIONAL COSTS","ARTICLE","WOS001209943000001","5","7","14","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2024,"VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ EDUARDO;SOLIS-GUZMAN JAIME;MARRERO MADELYN","MARRERO, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SEVILLE, INST UNIV CIENCIAS CONSTRUCC, IUACC, AV REINA MERCEDES 4-B, SEVILLE 41012, SPAIN","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","UNIV SEVILLE;UNIV SEVILLE;UNIV SEVILLE","UNIV SEVILLE",NA,"VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ E, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL","VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ E, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

ITS USE IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LA\&C), WHILE STILL SCARCE, IS DEVELOPING IN COMBINATION WITH MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING (MCDM) METHODS, SUCH AS THE CHOOSING BY ADVANTAGES (CBA) METHOD. DESPITE THE HOLISTIC NATURE OF MCDM METHODS, THE INCLUSION OF LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS IS LAGGING IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN LA\&C. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES POINT TOWARD THE NEED TO OPTIMIZE THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN BIM AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), IN WHICH A METHOD LIKE CBA COULD ALLOW IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE DECISIONS. THEREFORE, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INTEGRATE LCA AND CBA METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT THAT THE INCLUSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAN HAVE ON DECISION-MAKING IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, AS WELL AS COMPARING HOW THIS FINAL DECISION DIFFERS FROM AN EXCLUSIVELY LCA-ORIENTED INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. ONCE THE LCA WAS PERFORMED, A SET OF ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE CBA METHOD WERE FIXED, INCLUDING TRANSPARENCY, TECHNICAL, AND SOCIAL INDICATORS. THEREAFTER, A STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATIVE WORKSHOP WAS HELD IN ORDER TO GATHER EXPERTS TO ELUCIDATE ON THE FINAL DECISION. THE METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO A RELEVANT CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PROBLEM MODELLED WITH BIM IN THE CITY OF LIMA (PERU), WHICH CONSISTED OF THREE DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES NEEDED TO RETROFIT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. RESULTS FROM THE LCA-ORIENTED ASSESSMENT, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION, REVEALED A SITUATION IN WHICH THE MASONRY-BASED TECHNIQUE SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAN THE REMAINING TWO OPTIONS.

DURING ITS LIFE CYCLE, A BUILDING CONSUMES ENERGY IN THE FORM OF EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL ENERGY. EMBODIED ENERGY (EE) IS EXPENDED IN PROCESSES DURING CONSTRUCTION (EX: EXTRACTION OF RAW MATERIAL, TRANSPORTATION, MANUFACTURING, ETC.). OPERATING ENERGY (OE) IS SPENT ON OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE BUILDING TO ENSURE OCCUPANT COMFORT. UNLIKE OE, THE METHODS USED TO CALCULATE EE ARE COMPLEX, UNSTANDARDIZED, AND TIME-CONSUMING. EACH EE CALCULATION METHOD UTILIZES DIFFERENT SOURCES OF DATA AND SYSTEM BOUNDARY DEFINITIONS, THEREFORE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE ENERGY (LCE). LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT THE DISAGGREGATED INPUT-OUTPUT BASED HYBRID (IOH) APPROACH IS MORE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND RELIABLE IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER EE CALCULATION METHODS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE EE-OE RELATIONSHIP BY CALCULATING EE FACTORS FOR A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND RENOVATED EDUCATIONAL BUILDING. NEXT, WE ALSO COMPARE THE VARIATION IN EE FACTORS ACROSS DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) METHODS (PROCESS-BASED, AGGREGATED IOH, AND DISAGGREGATED IOH). THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT USING DIFFERENT LCI TECHNIQUES TO CALCULATE EE CAUSES MASSIVE VARIATIONS IN EE FACTORS, WHICH REPRESENT THE EE EXPENSE OF SAVING ONE UNIT OF OE. THE FINDINGS OF OUR STUDY AND LITERATURE REVIEW SHOW THAT THE PROCESS-BASED APPROACH UNDERESTIMATES EE, THEREFORE THE VALUES OF EE FACTORS CALCULATED USING THIS APPROACH NEED TO BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. THESE RESULTS FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDIZING THE EE CALCULATION METHOD.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION","110957","MDIXIT@TAMU.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.rser.2021.110957","SB0ES","1879-0690","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

DURING THEIR LIFESPANS, BUILDINGS CONSUME EMBODIED ENERGY (EE) AND OPERATIONAL ENERGY (OE). BUILDING PROFESSIONALS, THEREFORE, CONDUCT LIFE CYCLE ENERGY ASSESSMENTS (LCEA) TO QUANTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE PARADOX AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN EE AND OE. TRADITIONALLY, SIMULATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES WERE USED FOR DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION TO IDENTIFY A BUILDING DESIGN WITH THE FEWEST ENERGY IMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, LITERATURE SHOWS THESE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES ARE OFTEN ERROR-PRONE, TIME-CONSUMING, AND COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE, AND THEY FAIL TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME FEEDBACK TO THE USER. MOREOVER, EE AND OE ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE DISJOINTED AND SUFFER FROM INTEROPERABILITY ISSUES. THESE LIMITATIONS RESTRICT DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION, WHICH EVENTUALLY HINDERS THE DESIGN DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF BUILDING DATA HAS MADE MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNIQUES A POPULAR CHOICE FOR BUILDING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS. SEVERAL ARTICLES HAVE DEVELOPED PREDICTION MODELS TO ASSESS OR OPTIMIZE OE. WHILE THIS WORK IS SIGNIFICANT, STUDIES UTILIZING ML TECHNIQUES FOR BUILDING LCEA ARE LACKING, MAINLY DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF A LARGE-SCALE LCEA DATABASE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A METHODOLOGY TO (1) GENERATE A SIMULATION-BASED BUILDING ENERGY DATASET FOR DIFFERENT BUILDING TYPOLOGIES USING A PARAMETRIC FRAMEWORK, (2) UTILIZE THE SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED DATABASE TO DEVELOP AN ML-BASED PREDICTION MODEL TO PREDICT EE AND OE, AND (3) TEST THE MODEL USING A CASE STUDY. THE CASE STUDY RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MODEL ACHIEVES HIGH PREDICTION PERFORMANCE USING MINIMAL INPUTS AVAILABLE DURING THE EARLY DESIGN PHASE. THE RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE THAT ML TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED BY BUILDING DESIGNERS WITH NO OR LIMITED LCE EXPERTISE TO INSTANTANEOUSLY ESTIMATE BUILDING LCE PERFORMANCE AND HELP THEM SELECT DESIGN OPTIONS WITH MINIMAL LCE CONSUMPTION.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; TEXAS A\&M UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION","113444","VARSHAVENKATRAJ@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113444","Q7LI3","1872-6178","AUG 2023",NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [2048093]","THIS MATERIAL IS BASED UPON WORK PARTLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER GRANT NO. 2048093.

THE ACTORS WHO INVEST IN LONG-TERM ADAPTABILITY ARE POSITIONED BETTER TO THE CHANGES DURING THE LIFE CYCLE OF A BUILDING. THIS CONCEPTUAL PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT DOMINATING REAL ESTATE (PROPERTY) INVESTMENT ANALYSIS THEORIES DO NOT ACCOMMODATE ENOUGH BUILDING DESIGN-RELATED INFORMATION (I.E. PHYSICAL ASSET CHARACTERISTICS), WHICH RESULTS IN LONG-TERM LOSS OF COMPETITIVENESS AND UNSUSTAINABLE USE OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT RESOURCES. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT PHYSICAL ASSET CHARACTERISTICS CAN CREATE VALUABLE REAL OPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT. THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT LITERATURE HAS NOT SO FAR BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE A WIDELY ACCEPTED FINANCIAL MODEL FOR JUSTIFYING LIFE-CYCLE INVESTMENTS. A THEORY IS PROPOSED HERE THAT CAN BE USED TO VALUE LIFE-CYCLE INVESTMENTS IN BUILDINGS.

LCA PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL EMISSIONS GENERATED FOR A GIVEN FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF A PRODUCT, WHICH IS UTILIZED BY INDUSTRIES OR CONSUMERS FOR COMPARING TWO PRODUCTS WITH REGARDS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, MANY EXISTING LCAS UTILIZE DATA THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF AN AVERAGE SYSTEM WITH REGARDS TO LIFE CYCLE STAGE, THUS PROVIDING AN AGGREGATE PICTURE. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT REGIONAL VARIATION MAY LEAD TO LARGE VARIATION IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A PRODUCT, SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH ENERGY CONSUMPTION, RELATED EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE CONSUMPTIONS. HENCE, IMPROVING THE RELIABILITY OF LCA RESULTS FOR DECISION MAKING WITH REGARDS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE NEEDS REGIONAL MODELS TO BE INCORPORATED FOR BUILDING A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ORIGIN OF PRODUCTS FROM A CERTAIN REGION. IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT THE INTEGRATION OF REGIONALIZED DATA FROM PROCESS SYSTEMS MODELS AND OTHER SOURCES TO BUILD REGIONAL LCA MODELS AND QUANTIFY THE SPATIAL VARIATIONS PER UNIT OF BIODIESEL PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF INDIANA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. IN ORDER TO INCLUDE REGIONAL VARIATION, WE HAVE INCORPORATED INFORMATION ABOUT PLANT CAPACITY FOR PRODUCING BIODIESEL FROM NORTH AND CENTRAL INDIANA. THE LCA MODEL BUILT IS A CRADLE-TO-GATE. ONCE THE REGION-SPECIFIC MODELS ARE BUILT, THE DATA WERE UTILIZED IN SIMAPRO TO INTEGRATE WITH UPSTREAM PROCESSES TO PERFORM A LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA). WE REPORT THE RESULTS PER LITER OF BIODIESEL FROM NORTHERN AND CENTRAL INDIANA FACILITIES IN THIS WORK. THE IMPACT CATEGORIES STUDIED WERE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (KG CO2 EQ) AND FRESHWATER EUTROPHICATION (KG P EQ). WHILE THERE WERE A LOT OF VARIATIONS AT INDIVIDUAL COUNTY LEVEL, BOTH REGIONS HAD A SIMILAR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL IMPACT AND THE NORTHERN REGION HAD RELATIVELY LOWER EUTROPHICATION IMPACTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","PURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; PURDUE UNIVERSITY; PURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM; PURDUE UNIVERSITY","392","VVUNNAVA@PURDUE.EDU SINGH294@PURDUE.EDU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/pr8040392","LT2GX","2227-9717",NA,NA,"PURDUE SURF PATHWAYS PROGRAM; U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [NSF CBET-1805741]; NMSU","PARTIAL FUNDING PROVIDED BY PURDUE SURF PATHWAYS PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTED ESAI LOPEZ DURING THE SURF PROGRAM AND FUNDING FROM NMSU FOR ESAI LOPEZ'S SUMMER RESEARCH.

BECAUSE PREFABRICATED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (PCPS) ARE INTERORGANIZATIONAL IN NATURE, THEIR SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY, ESPECIALLY UNDER UNCERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RELIES ON ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AN ETHNOGRAPHY-BASED METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PCPS TO EVALUATE, ANALYZE, AND IMPROVE THE DYNAMIC ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE REGARDING EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY, AND ROBUSTNESS FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. A TWO-PART FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED. THE QUALITATIVE FIRST PART IDENTIFIES THE ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS OF PARTICIPATING STAKEHOLDERS DURING EACH PROJECT PHASE, AND THE SECOND QUANTITATIVE PART MEASURES AND ANALYZES THE PCP'S ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE. A TYPICAL ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION (EPC) CONTRACT PCP IN CHINA IS USED AS A CASE ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THIS DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ROBUSTNESS AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE PCP SHOULD BE IMPROVED. SUCH IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY MANAGING AND ENHANCING THE WORKFLOW CONTROL AND HOW STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNICATE. THIS SCENARIO WAS EXAMINED VIA A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYING BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) AND DECENTRALIZED COLLABORATION PLATFORM (DCP) WITHIN THE CASE PROJECT. FINALLY, THIS DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK COULD BE USED AS A PRACTICAL DECISION-MAKING TOOL FOR MANAGERS TO IMPROVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE IN THE ASPECTS OF EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY, AND ROBUSTNESS OF PCPS IN CASE UNFORESEEN EVENTS ARE ENCOUNTERED. IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE BODY OF PCPS BY INCORPORATING ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE THEORY INTO ITS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENTS.","1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA","ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE; TIANJIN CHENGJIAN UNIVERSITY","04022110","LGGE@STUDENT.UNIMELB.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002381","3U3LM","1943-7862",NA,NA,"NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [20FJLB025]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (GRANT NO. 20FJLB025).",NA,"0733-9364","J.

AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS NEITHER SUCCEEDED IN RURAL ENERGY SUBSTITUTION NOR ACHIEVED OTHER SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS, ALTHOUGH AVAILABLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OTHERWISE. THE REASON BEHIND THIS DISPARITY LARGELY LIES IN INACCURATE ADOPTION OF THE OPERATIONAL CYCLE, I.E., THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL OPERATIONAL TIME OF THE BIOGAS DIGESTER WAS OFTEN OVERESTIMATED. PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, AN EIO-LCA MODEL USING THE CHINESE ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE OF 2007 WAS BUILT TO ESTIMATE CARBON-DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSION DURING THE LIFE CYCLE OF A TYPICAL 8 M(3) HOUSEHOLD BIOGAS DIGESTER AND THEIR SOURCES WITH REGARD TO ECONOMIC SECTORS. THE LIFE CYCLE OF A BIOGAS DIGESTER CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE STAGES: CONSTRUCTION (INCLUDING POND BUILDING AND PEN, TOILET AND STOVE ALTERATIONS), OPERATION (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE AND BIOGAS COMBUSTION) AND DISPOSAL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NET CO2 EMISSION OF A BIOGAS DIGESTER IS 1558.91 KG AFTER ONE YEAR OF OPERATION, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO AN ACTUAL CO2 EMISSION OF 2878.30 KG (OF WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS ARE 1558.90 AND 1319.40 KG, RESPECTIVELY) AND AN EMISSION REDUCTION BY FUEL SUBSTITUTION AND FERTILIZER CONSERVATION OF 1078.59 AND 240.80 KG, RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE, THE MODEL INDICATES THAT A BIOGAS DIGESTER SHOULD BE RUN FOR AT LEAST 2.77 YEARS TO HAVE A NET CO2 EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFIT. THE MODEL ALSO INDICATES THAT COMPREHENSIVE UTILIZATION OF BIOGAS AND ITS BYPRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CARBON EMISSION IN RURAL AREAS. MOST OF THE INDIRECT EMISSIONS WERE DERIVED FROM CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, ACCOUNTING FOR 88.18\%. MOREOVER, THE SMELTING AND PRESSING OF FERROUS METALS IN THE 43-STEP PRODUCTION CHAIN OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS ACCOUNTED FOR 22.48\% OF THE INDIRECT EMISSIONS. THIS GIVES US A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE TO DEVELOP EMISSION REDUCTION POLICIES. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION FOR POLICY-MAKING ON BIOGAS PROMOTION AND MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL CHINA.

IN THIS STUDY, A LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED FOR THE EVALUATION AND COMPARISON OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE THREE DISPOSAL STRATEGIES MENTIONED ABOVE IN TERMS OF FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXTRACTION OF RESOURCES, LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY, AND EFFECT ON HUMAN HEALTH BY USING THE INFORMATION OBTAINED WITH TYPICAL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM). IN THE LCA FRAMEWORK, FOUR ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT-ALLOCATION TYPES (NAMELY, NO, EQUAL, MASS, AND ECONOMIC ALLOCATIONS) ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE FINAL IMPACTS OF THE PRODUCTS TO BE SHARED BY MORE THAN ONE PRODUCT SYSTEM. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT A PARTICULAR DISPOSAL STRATEGY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY CONSIDERING AN ENTIRE BUILDING TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVE REUSE/RECYCLING POTENTIAL. IN ADDITION, A BIM-BASED PLUG-IN (BIM-EF) IS DEVELOPED FOR THE AUTOMATIC APPRAISAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS AT THE EOL STAGE BY USING REVIT ADD-IN MANAGER. TWO DATA LIBRARIES (THE ENGINEERING QUANTITY DATA LIBRARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FACTOR LIBRARY) ARE CREATED, AND A CODING SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED TO CONNECT THE INFORMATION STORED IN THE BIM MODEL AND THE TWO DATA LIBRARIES.

ESPECIALLY, THE TREATMENT OF WASTE (I.E. DEMOLITION, COLLECTION, SORTING, TRANSPORTATION, RECYCLING AND LANDFILL) HAS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS, E.G. CARBON EMISSIONS DUE TO ENERGY CONSUMED BY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE WASTE TREATMENT METHODS WITH LOW CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES PREDOMINATELY FOCUSED ON QUANTIFYING THE CARBON EMISSION OF BUILDINGS. IN CONTRAST, THE CARBON EMISSION DERIVED FROM THE TREATMENT OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE IS LARGELY OVERLOOKED. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY TO FACILITATE THE ASSESSMENT OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE. IN THIS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO HARVEST DATA AND FEED INTO THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT. CASE STUDY OF A HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WAS CONDUCTED TO SHOWCASE HOW THIS FRAMEWORK CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT DERIVED FROM RECYCLING OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE VARIES FROM ONE MATERIAL TO ANOTHER. THE RECYCLING OF METAL WASTE HAS FAR HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS COMPARED TO MASONRY WASTES. IN PARTICULAR, ALUMINUM COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AS HIGH AS 45\% OF CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DESPITE ONLY ACCOUNTING FOR 0.66\% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT. ACROSS VARIOUS LIFECYCLE STAGES, THE ONSITE COLLECTION AND SORTING IS THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSION. IN ADDITION, ON-SITE RECYCLING HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO FACTORY RECYCLING AND LANDFILL IN TERMS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. FURTHERMORE, A LARGE SCALE INVENTORIES ARE DEVELOPED AS AN OUTCOME OF THIS CASE STUDY. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE USEFUL INPUTS TO THE FUTURE ENDEAVOR OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE RECYCLING IN A BID TO REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED CARBON EMISSIONS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD.

BIM ENHANCES SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH ENERGY SIMULATIONS, MATERIAL SELECTION, WASTE REDUCTION, AND ENERGY MONITORING. HOWEVER, CHALLENGES LIKE TALENT SHORTAGE, INTEROPERABILITY ISSUES, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND LACK OF STANDARDIZATION HINDER ITS WIDESPREAD USE. CURRENT RESEARCH LACKS SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF BIM'S APPLICATION IN GREEN BUILDINGS' LIFE CYCLE, LIMITING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. TO FILL THIS RESEARCH GAP, THIS STUDY AIMS TO PROVIDE A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION OF BIM IN THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION STAGES OF THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE OF GREEN BUILDINGS. AS A GUIDELINE TO CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH, THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES (PRISMA) MODEL ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN PROCEDURES FOR LITERATURE SCREENING AND REVIEW. THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, THE MAIN APPLICATIONS OF BIM TECHNOLOGY IN GREEN BUILDINGS ARE SUMMARIZED, WHILE THE CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT APPLICATIONS AND THE CORRESPONDING SOLUTIONS ARE DISCUSSED. FINALLY, THE STUDY PROPOSES KEY POINTS FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF BIM TO HELP THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TRULY REALIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND NATURE AND HARMONY AND GREENERY.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITI MALAYA; UNIVERSITI MALAYA",NA,"ZULKIFLEE1969@UM.EDU.MY",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1080/17512549.2024.2383866","G0V9I","1756-2201","JUL 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1751-2549","ADV.

HBD INCLUDES ADAPTABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, MAINTENANCE, AND DISASTER PREPARATION. IT IS A KEY IDEA IN THE PRESENT BOOM IN RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDING TECHNIQUES. A SURPRISING DEARTH OF QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON HBD'S IMPACT ON LMBS CONSIDERING THE FIELD'S GROWING IMPORTANCE. THIS STUDY USES A QUANTITATIVE METHOD TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESSENTIAL HBD COMPONENTS AND LMBS OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY EXTENDED SERVICE LIFE (ESL) AND OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE AND VALUE (OPV) ARE CRITICAL FACTORS TO ADDRESS THIS INFORMATION GAP. THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY POLLED 171 CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS AND UTILIZED STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO EXAMINE THE DATA. THIS APPROACH WAS SELECTED FOR ITS ABILITY TO EXPLORE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES AND CONSTRUCTS. HBD COMPONENTS ADAPTABILITY AND RETROFITTING (AAR), ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SUSTAINABILITY (ECS), MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION PROGRAMS (MIP), AND RESILIENCE AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS (RDP) PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED THE ENHANCED SERVICE LIFE (ESL) AND OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE AND VALUE (OPV) ELEMENTS OF LMBS. BUILDING ADAPTATION AND RETROFITTING, MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION PROGRAMS, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCREASED BUILDING VALUE AND LIFESPAN. THESE FINDINGS HAVE MAJOR THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE WORK POTENTIALLY FILLS A RESEARCH GAP BY PROVIDING ACTUAL EVIDENCE ON HBD-LMBS LINKAGES. PRACTICALLY, THE RESULTS ADVISE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS TO USE HBD IDEAS FOR SUSTAINABLE BUILDING MANAGEMENT. FINALLY, OUR WORK ILLUMINATES THE VITAL ROLES OF HBD COMPONENTS IN LMBS AND PAVES THE WAY FOR ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY BUILDING APPROACHES.","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","KUWAIT UNIVERSITY; INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, PAKISTAN; TAIF UNIVERSITY; PRINCE SATTAM BIN ABDULAZIZ UNIVERSITY","29020","ABDULMATEEN.MSCE28@IIU.EDU.PK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1038/s41598-024-80547-3","N2C0A",NA,NA,NA,"TAIF UNIVERSITY, SAUDI ARABIA [TU-DSPP-2024-33]","THE AUTHORS EXTEND THEIR APPRECIATION TO TAIF UNIVERSITY, SAUDI ARABIA, FOR SUPPORTING THIS WORK THROUGH PROJECT NUMBER (TU-DSPP-2024-33).",NA,"2045-2322","SCI REP","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","ENGLISH","NOV 22",NA,"98","1","GOLD",NA,NA,NA,"NATURE PORTFOLIO","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS","BENJEDDOU, OMRANE/AHI-3882-2022 ALMUJIBAH, HAMAD/CAF-7914-2022 KHAN, ABDUL MATEEN/JUF-0000-2023",NA,0,"ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF HOLISTIC BUILDING DESIGN ON THE PROCESS OF LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT OF BUILDING STRUCTURES","ARTICLE","WOS001362462000021","0","0","14","MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2024,"WAQAR AHSAN;ALRASHEED KHALED A;KHAN ABDUL MATEEN; ALMUJIBAH HAMAD;BENJEDDOU OMRANE","KHAN, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INT ISLAMIC UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, ISLAMABAD 44000, PAKISTAN","ISI","SCI REP","INT ISLAMIC UNIV;UNIV LAHORE;KUWAIT UNIV;INT ISLAMIC UNIV;TAIF UNIV;PRINCE SATTAM BIN ABDULAZIZ UNIV","INT ISLAMIC UNIV",NA,"WAQAR A, 2024, SCI REP","WAQAR A, 2024, SCI REP",NA

NOTWITHSTANDING ITS ADVANTAGES, THERE EXIST CERTAIN LIMITATIONS THAT HINDER ITS EXTENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE DISPARITIES RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) BY CONDUCTING A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF FACTORS SUCH AS DATA INTEROPERABILITY, STANDARDIZATION, COLLABORATION, SKILL GAPS, AND RESISTANCE TO CHANGE. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A PRELIMINARY PILOT SURVEY AND A PRIMARY QUESTIONNAIRE. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE THEN SUBJECTED TO ANALYSIS USING TWO STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES: EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA) AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (PLS-SEM). THIS STUDY REVEALS NOTEWORTHY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE ADOPTION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND SEVERAL CRUCIAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI), MONITORING AND CONTROL (MC), PROJECT MANAGEMENT (PM), RESOLUTION AND PERFORMANCE (RP), STRUCTURAL MANAGEMENT (SM), SUSTAINABILITY ADMINISTRATION (SA), AND VALUE MANAGEMENT (VM). THIS STUDY PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR PROFESSIONALS AND POLICYMAKERS, OFFERING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND ADVOCATING FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH ON COMPLEMENTARY FACTORS. THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTION OF RECOGNIZED SHORTCOMINGS, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) CAN BE EMPLOYED IN A PROFICIENT MANNER TO AUGMENT COLLABORATION, MITIGATE COSTS, OPTIMIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGIES.

THEN, THE VALIDITY OF THE DEVELOPED MODEL WAS VERIFIED FROM BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVES. FINALLY, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIM WAS TESTED USING THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OVERALL SCORE OF THE TESTED PROJECT WAS FOUR IN THE FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE, WITH AN AVERAGE RELATIVE ERROR LESS THAN 1\%. FROM A VALUE-BASED PERSPECTIVE, IT IS REVEALED THAT THE APPLICATION VALUE OF BIM REPRESENTED A DESCENDING ORDER THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE OF THE TESTED PROJECT. IN ADDITION, IT IS FOUND THAT THE FUNCTIONAL VALUE OBTAINED THE HIGHEST SCORE, WHEREAS SOCIAL VALUE WAS AT THE BOTTOM.

WIDELY ADOPTED ASSESSMENT METHODS CONSIDER EITHER SINGLE ISSUES OR DO NOT COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS LINKS BETWEEN ISSUES. ONE EXCEPTION IS THE CLEER MODEL, WHICH COMPARES LIFE CYCLE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS OF CLOUD-BASED AND PRESENT-DAY SERVICES. HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS THE NEED TO VERIFY COMPONENTS FOR INCLUSION IN A DATA CENTRE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), ASSESS QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF SECONDARY DATA, BENCHMARK AN EXISTING DATA CENTRE LCA, ASSESS NON-CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR MULTIPLE IMPACTS, AND ESTABLISH FACILITY AREAS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE. A HYBRID APPROACH, COMBINING PROCESS-BASED AND ECONOMIC INPUT OUTPUT (EIO) DATA, WAS USED TO PERFORM THE SCREENING LCA OF AN EXISTING UK DATA CENTRE. THE STUDY INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF THE GOAL AND SCOPE, MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS, A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION AND A SENSITIVITY CHECK. THE DOMINANCE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) OPERATIONAL PHASE TO THE OVERALL IMPACT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH ARE CONCLUDED. DUE TO THE USE OF FREE COOLING, THE IT-EMBODIED IMPACT IS GREATER THAN THE COMBINED MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL OPERATIONAL IMPACT. ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION DOMINATES THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE IMPACT; HOWEVER, THE SECOND MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT DERIVES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF METAL REFINING WASTE PRODUCTS DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF IT COMPONENTS AND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. THE RELEASE OF CARCINOGENS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT AND IS ALMOST EQUAL IN VALUE BETWEEN THE EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL PHASES. FINALLY, A SENSITIVITY CHECK FOUND THAT A SWEDISH FACILITY OPTIMISED FOR OPERATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH A 1.25-YEAR SERVER REFRESH RESULTED IN AN EMBODIED IMPACT ALMOST DOUBLE THE OPERATIONAL. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT CURRENT LCI DATA, SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND PROJECT DATA ALLOW FOR A SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE DATA CENTRE LCA MODEL. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE NEED TO BROADEN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION TO BEYOND OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR COOLING AND THAT BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS (BEAMS) SHOULD CONSIDER MORE EMBODIED IMPACTS.

THIS DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS SMART ENERGY SYSTEMS (SES) INCLUDES EMERGING USE CASES AT THE DISTRIBUTION GRID LEVEL, E.G., SMART CHARGING STRATEGIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN BUILDINGS. AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF SUCH, HOWEVER, IS CHALLENGING. THE STANDARDIZED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) APPROACHES SEEM INSUFFICIENT SINCE SES ARE EMERGING SYSTEMS AT THE INTERFACE OF DIGITALIZATION AND ENERGY WITH MULTIPLE INTENDED AND UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DERIVE SOLUTION APPROACHES FOR LCA PROFESSIONALS THAT INVESTIGATE USE CASES ENABLED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT), SPECIFICALLY IN SES. TO IDENTIFY CHALLENGES DURING THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF AN LCA AND SOLUTION APPROACHES, WE EXAMINE SEVEN RECENT RESEARCH PROJECTS AND CONDUCT A REAL-TIME DELPHI WORKSHOP WITH LCA EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF SES. AS A RESULT, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES APPROACHES ON SETTING UP AN LCA, FILLING DATA GAPS, AND METHODS TO DRAW UPON THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF USE CASES IN SES. KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE A MODIFIED TAXONOMY OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. RESULTS SHOW THAT SYSTEMIC EFFECTS IN SES HAVE POTENTIALLY THE HIGHEST IMPACT ON THE LCA, FOLLOWED BY EFFECTS CAUSED BY USER BEHAVIOR. ASSESSING THESE EFFECTS OF `HIGHER-ORDER' POSES AN INCREASED COMPLEXITY. DETERMINED SOLUTION APPROACHES INCLUDE COMBINING THE STANDARDIZED LCA WITH ENERGY SYSTEM MODELING OR SURVEYS ON USER BEHAVIOR.

THIS GAP IS PARTLY DUE TO (I) THE LACK OF AN ACCESSIBLE INTERFACE THAT CONNECTS BIM SOFTWARE WITH DURABILITY MODELS OF BUILT STRUCTURES, AND (II) NO AVAILABLE DURABILITY MODELS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL IN NATURE AND THUS CAN INTEGRATE WITH OTHER TOOLS. TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THIS GAP, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK THAT USES THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) WITHIN BIM TO INTEGRATE PHYSICS-BASED DURABILITY PERFORMANCE MODELS, WHICH EXTENDS THE APPLICATION OF BIM INTO THE POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASES BY ENABLING MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE.

NOW THE INDUSTRIES ARE ASSESSING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WITH THE INDIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING EXPERTS FROM THE SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN REGION OF INDIA. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON EMAIL INTERVIEWS, IN-DEPTH PHONE CALLS AND A MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY CIRCULATED THROUGH EMAILS. THE INTERVIEWEES REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INDIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES WITH VARYING KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT INCLUDING THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS, CONSULTANTS FOR AM INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND ACADEMIA. THE EXPERTS SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR GOOD UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT FACTORS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES WHICH WILL HELP THEM TO LOWER THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS AND CONDUCT THE LCA IN THE INDUSTRIES WITH PROPER LCA TOOLS AND DATABASES AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES. THIS STUDY WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THE RESEARCHERS AND R\&D IN INDUSTRIES TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS THAT HOW INDIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES EXPERIENCE THE USE OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT. IN THE STUDY, SEVERAL AWARENESS ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED WHICH WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR INDIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TO EXPAND AND ACCELERATE THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPLICATIONS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.","152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT SYSTEM); MALAVIYA NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY JAIPUR",NA,"RAGRAWAL.MECH@MNIT.AC.IN",NA,"RECENT ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, ICEM 2020","2024-12-23","10.1007/978-981-16-5281-3\_7","BS9GN","2195-4364",NA,"AGRAWAL, R AND JAIN, JK AND YADAV, VS AND MANUPATI, VK AND VARELA, L",NA,NA,"978-981-16-5281-3; 978-981-16-5280-6","2195-4356",NA,"RECENT ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, ICEM 2020","ENGLISH",NA,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EVOLUTION IN MANUFACTURING (ICEM), ELECTR NETWORK, DEC 10-12, 2020","40",NA,NA,"KUMAR, SUNDEEP/0000-0002-4394-1236",NA,"67-77","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","ENGINEERING","JAMWAL, ANBESH/AAF-6434-2021 KUMAR, SUNDEEP/KUC-7863-2024","LECTURE NOTES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING",0,"EXPERIENCING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT IN INDIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES: NEEDS, CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000780549600007","10","22",NA,"ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL; ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL \& ELECTRONIC; ENGINEERING, MECHANICAL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2022,"YADAV ALOK;JAMWAL ANBESH;AGRAWAL RAJEEV;KUMAR SUNDEEP","AGRAWAL, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MALAVIYA NATL INST TECHNOL, DEPT MECH ENGN, JLN MARG, JAIPUR 302017, RAJASTHAN, INDIA","ISI","RECENT ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, ICEM 2020","MALAVIYA NATL INST TECHNOL;MALAVIYA NATL INST TECHNOL;CTR ELECT GOVERNANCE","MALAVIYA NATL INST TECHNOL",NA,"YADAV A, 2022, RECENT ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, ICEM 2020","YADAV A, 2022, RECENT ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, ICEM 2020",NA

MANY STUDIES CONDUCTED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF BUILDINGS TO EVALUATE CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF DYNAMIC DATA, MOST STUDIES ADOPTED THE STATIC LCA METHODOLOGY, WHICH NEGLECTED THE DYNAMIC VARIATIONS DURING LIFE CYCLE STAGES OF A BUILDING. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT COLLECTED STATIC DATA FROM QUESTIONNAIRES AND DOCUMENTS, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO ESTABLISH A NOVEL DYNAMIC LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (D-LCA) FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDINGS BY INCORPORATING THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND THE BUILDING ENERGY MODELING PROGRAM (BEMP) INTO THE STATIC LCA. FIRST, A STATIC LCA IS ESTABLISHED AS THE BASELINE SCENARIO THAT COVERS THE ``CRADLE-TO-GRAVE'' LIFE CYCLE STAGES. A BIM MODEL IS ESTABLISHED USING REVIT TO OBTAIN THE INVENTORY OF BUILDING MATERIALS. THE DESIGNER SIMULATION TOOLKIT (DEST) IS USED AS A BEMP TO SIMULATE THE OPERATING ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE STUDIED BUILDING, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN ENERGY MIX, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DEST RESULTS ARE FURTHER USED AS A DATA INPUT FOR DYNAMIC SCENARIOS. THE D-LCA FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO A HIGH-RISE COMMERCIAL BUILDING IN CHINA.

THE INTEGRATION OF BIM AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE TIME FOR LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THE LCA RESULTS FOR THE SPECIFIC BUILDING DESIGN. THE LATTER MERIT IS NOT TRIVIAL. FOR INSTANCE, DUE TO TIME LIMIT, MOST BUILDING LCA STUDIES ESTIMATE THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND FUELS CONSUMED IN CONSTRUCTION PHASE QUITE ROUGHLY, WHICH EXCLUDES THE CHOICES ON A WIDE RANGE OF CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES, MATERIALS, SPECIALTIES AND MACHINES, NO NEED TO MENTION THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OPERATION PHASE, WHICH IS USUALLY ESTIMATED IN AN EVEN BOLDER MANNER. THE ROUGHNESS OF THE LCA PRACTICE UNDERMINES ITS CREDIBILITY AND HINDERS ITS APPLICATION AS A DECISION SUPPORTING TOOL FOR LOW CARBON DESIGN. CURRENTLY, CHINA'S ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) SECTOR IS UNDERGOING A SMART TRANSFORMATION, STEERED BY THE INCREASED USE OF BIM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A BIM-ENABLED LCA METHOD AND ILLUSTRATES HOW THE METHOD CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE THE LOW CARBON DESIGN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE SMART AEC TRANSITION IN CHINA. A CASE STUDY ON CARBON FOOTPRINT ACCOUNTING FOR A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS CONDUCTED. IN THIS STUDY, VARIOUS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND DATA SOURCES ARE COMBINED TO ENHANCE THE DATA FLOW AND INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN BIM MODELS AND LCA MODELS. BIM TOOLS ARE USED TO CREATE THE BIM MODEL, CALCULATE THE INPUTS (MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION MACHINES, ENERGIES, WATER AND SO ON) OF ON-SITE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND SIMULATE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BUILDING OPERATION. THE EBALANCE, A CHINA'S LOCAL LCA SOFTWARE TOOL IS APPLIED TO BUILD THE LCA MODEL. THE CHINESE LIFE CYCLE DATABASE IS USED AS THE MAIN DATA SOURCE (72.73\%) TO CALCULATE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE GIVEN BUILDING WHILE THE ECOINVENT DATABASE AND EUROPEAN LIFE CYCLE DATABASE ACT AS SUPPLEMENTARY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING IS 2993 KG CO(2)EQ/M(2). THE OPERATION PHASE CONTRIBUTES TO 69\% OF THE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSION, WHILE THE BUILDING MATERIAL PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES TO 24\%. CONCRETE IS THE MOST USED BUILDING MATERIAL, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 82\% OF MASS BUT CONTRIBUTES TO ONLY 44\% OF THE MATERIAL RELATED GHG EMISSION. ALTHOUGH STEEL AND ALUMINUM ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 2.6\% AND 1.4\% OF MASS, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO 28\% AND 17\% GHG EMISSION, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGH BIM-ENABLE LCA MODELING, THE POTENTIAL LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUILDINGS CAN BE ASSESSED IN DETAIL. THIS MAKES THE LCA NOT ONLY MORE ACCESSIBLE BUT ALSO MORE CREDIBLE FOR THE AEC PROFESSIONALS TO USE IT AS A GUIDE FOR THE LOW CARBON DESIGN OF BUILDINGS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD.

LOW-CARBON, GREEN, AND SUSTAINABLE BRIDGE ENGINEERING HAS EMERGED AS AN INEVITABLE TREND. A COMPREHENSIVE CARBON EMISSION CALCULATION SYSTEM IS KEY TO ACHIEVING LOW-CARBON BRIDGES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A RAPID CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR BRIDGE CARBON EMISSIONS (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING-LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT, BIM-LCA). THIS SYSTEM, USING THE BRIDGE INFORMATION MODEL AS A CARRIER, CALCULATES AND MANAGES DATA ON MATERIAL CONSUMPTION, MACHINERY, TRANSPORTATION, AND ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE BRIDGE'S LIFE CYCLE. IT THEN CALCULATES THE CARBON EMISSIONS FOR EACH STAGE. THIS SYSTEM SIMPLIFIES THE COMPLEX AND CUMBERSOME DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS PROCESSES FOUND IN TRADITIONAL METHODS WHILE ALSO MAKING THE CARBON EMISSIONS ACROSS THE FULL BRIDGE LIFE CYCLE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND VISIBLE. BEING APPLICABLE TO ALL TYPES OF BRIDGES, THIS SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS AND A BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES AND DURING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION TO SUPPORT CARBON REDUCTION. ULTIMATELY, IT PROMOTES LOW-CARBON, ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, AND SUSTAINABLE BRIDGE ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","SOUTH CHINA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","10574","GMEDIYANG@163.COM GMEDIYUE@163.COM GMEDILUO@163.COM CTJINLI@MAIL.SCUT.EDU.CN CTJBY@SCUT.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su162310574","P4P9I","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","DEC",NA,"63","23","GOLD",NA,NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",NA,NA,0,"BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING-LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT: A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY FOR RAPID CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS OF BRIDGES","ARTICLE","WOS001377758300001","0","0","16","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2024,"YANG YONG;YUE XIAOGANG;LUO YONGLE;JIN LI;JIA BUYU","JIA, BY (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), SOUTH CHINA UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL ENGN \& TRANSPORTAT, GUANGZHOU 510641, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","SOUTH CHINA UNIV TECHNOL;GUANGZHOU MUNICIPAL ENGN DESIGN AND RES INST CO LTD;SOUTH CHINA UNIV TECHNOL","SOUTH CHINA UNIV TECHNOL",NA,"YANG Y, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY","YANG Y, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

WALL INSULATION) IN HOT SUMMER AND COLD WINTER ZONE OF CHINA. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION, DISTRIBUTION FITTING AND STATISTICAL TESTS WERE USED TO CONDUCT RELEVANT ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOW THAT COOLING ENERGY UNCERTAINTY AT DIFFERENT TEMPORAL SCALES IS SIGNIFICANT RANGING FROM 8.59\% (ANNUAL) TO 70.22\% (HOURLY) WHILE STANDARDS/CODES-BASED AC SETTING DOES NOT PROVIDE UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION. THE WIDELY USED SIMPLE ASSUMPTION THAT THE RELATIVE VALUES OF THE ENERGY-SAVING EFFECTS IN ACTUAL ARE THE SAME AS THOSE IN THERMAL SIMULATION (STANDARD-BASED AC SETTING) IS INCORRECT AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OVERESTIMATION OF COOLING ENERGY SAVING BY STANDARD-BASED AC SETTING. FURTHER LIFE CYCLE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ADDING WALL INSULATION SHOWS THAT STANDARDS/CODES-BASED AC SETTING MAY OVERESTIMATE NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) BY ABOUT 1243.82\% AND LEAD TO AN INAPPROPRIATE DESIGN DECISION WHEN COMPARING DIFFERENT ENERGY-SAVING MEASURES. THEREFORE, EXISTING BUILDING STANDARDS/CODES-BASED AC SETTING MAY LEAD TO BIASED ENERGY AND ECONOMIC PREDICTION OF ENERGY-SAVING MEASURES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE BUILDING STANDARD AND POLICY IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROVIDED.

GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY IN THE FORMULATION OF STRUCTURAL DESIGN PROBLEMS, THE PROCESS OF OPTIMIZATION IS COMMONLY PERFORMED USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION, SUCH AS THE GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA). HOWEVER, THE INTEGRATION OF AI-BASED OPTIMIZATION, TOGETHER WITH VISUAL PROGRAMMING (VP), IN BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PROJECTS WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A WORKFLOW BY COMBINING STRUCTURE ANALYSIS, VP, BIM, AND GA TO OPTIMIZE TRUSSES. THE METHODOLOGY ENCOMPASSES SEVERAL STEPS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I) GENERATION OF PARAMETRIC TRUSSES IN DYNAMO VP; (II) PERFORMING FINITE ELEMENT MODELING (FEM) USING ROBOT STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (RSA); (III) RETRIEVING AND EVALUATING THE FEM RESULTS INTERCHANGEABLY BETWEEN DYNAMO AND RSA; (IV) FINDING THE BEST SOLUTION USING GA; AND (V) IMPORTING THE OPTIMIZED MODEL INTO REVIT, ENABLING THE USER TO PERFORM SIMULATIONS AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, SUCH AS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND QUANTITY SURVEYING. THIS METHODOLOGY PROVIDES A NEW INTEROPERABLE FRAMEWORK WITH MINIMAL INTERFERENCE WITH EXISTING SUPPLY-CHAIN PROCESSES, AND IT WILL BE FLEXIBLE TO TECHNOLOGY LITERACY AND ALLOW ARCHITECTURAL, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) PROFESSIONALS TO EMPLOY VP, GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION, AND FEM IN BIM-BASED PROJECTS BY LEVERAGING OPEN-SOURCED SOFTWARE AND TOOLS, TOGETHER WITH COMMONLY USED DESIGN SOFTWARE. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED WORKFLOW WAS TESTED ON BENCHMARK PROBLEMS AND COMPARED WITH THE OPEN LITERATURE. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS STUDY OFFER INSIGHT INTO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF COMBINING VP, GA, FEA, AND BIM FOR STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION APPLICATIONS, PARTICULARLY TO ENHANCE STRUCTURAL EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN CONSTRUCTION. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THIS STUDY IN DEVELOPING A WORKABLE, USER-FRIENDLY, AND INTEROPERABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE UTILIZATION OF VP, GA, FEM, AND BIM FOR STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION, THE RESULTS OBTAINED COULD BE IMPROVED BY (I) INCREASING THE CALLBACK FUNCTION SPEED BETWEEN DYNAMO AND RSA THROUGH SPECIALIZED APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API); AND (II) FINE-TUNING THE GA PARAMETERS OR UTILIZING OTHER ADVANCED GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION AND SUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR THE OPTIMIZATION.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION; KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY; KARADENIZ TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY","1532","FEYZULLAH.YAVAN@KIT.EDU REZA.MAALEK@KIT.EDU TOGAN@KTU.EDU.TR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings14061532","WJ7Y2","2075-5309",NA,NA,"ENDOWED PROFESSORSHIP IN DIGITAL ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (DEC) AT THE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION (TMB) OF THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (KIT); KIT PUBLICATION FUND OF THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SUPPLYING THE APC","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RESEARCH FUNDS OF THE ENDOWED PROFESSORSHIP IN DIGITAL ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (DEC) AT THE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION (TMB) OF THE KARLSRUHE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (KIT).

IN TURKEY, SIX MILLION OUT OF TWENTY-TWO MILLION BUILDINGS NEED TO BE DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT TO MEET SEISMIC STANDARDS. THESE BUILDINGS ARE ALSO FAR BELOW THE STANDARDS IN TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THEREFORE, URBAN TRANSFORMATION CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES FOUR THINGS: (I) THE ENERGY-EFFICIENT URBAN TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY IN GAZIOSMANPASA-ISTANBUL REGION, WHICH IS SELECTED AS A CASE STUDY; (II) THE EFFECT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THIS MARKET; (III) THE ADEQUACY OF ENERGY STANDARDS OF TURKEY; AND (IV) CONTRIBUTION OF DIGITALIZATION IN CONSTRUCTION TO SUSTAINABILITY WITH BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AND ENERGY ANALYSIS. ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCENARIOS, ENERGY ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT ON THE BIM MODEL. THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE STRATEGY WAS DETERMINED WITH THE LIFE CYCLE COST METHOD. WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAVE ENERGY UP TO 227 GWH A YEAR, WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL HEATING ENERGY DEMAND OF APPROXIMATELY 30,000 HOUSING, IN THE CASE STUDY AREA WITH THE MOST EFFICIENT SCENARIO TO BE REALIZED.","86400 PARIT RAJA, BATU PAHAT, JOHOR, 00000, MALAYSIA","ISTANBUL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY; ISTANBUL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY",NA,"YAYLAA@ITU.EDU.TR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.30880/ijscet.2021.12.03.015","WS0IG",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2180-3242","INT.

BECAUSE THERE ARE ANNUAL REPORTS OF CONSTRUCTION SAFETY ACCIDENTS IN CHINA, TRADITIONAL SAFETY MANAGEMENT SHOULD LOOK FOR BREAKTHROUGHS. ALTHOUGH MANY SCHOLARS USE VARIOUS METHODS TO IMPROVE BUILDING SAFETY, THEY LACK THE CONSIDERATION OF BUILDING LIFE CYCLE SAFETY PLANNING. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A LIFE CYCLE SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM BASED ON BIM-4D. THE ISSUES WITH TRADITIONAL SAFETY MANAGEMENT ARE FIRST EXAMINED. THEN, IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE USE OF BIM-4D TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE PROJECT SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND EXHIBITS THE BENEFITS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THIS REGARD. FOLLOWING THAT, A BIM-4D-BASED LIFE CYCLE SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM IS BUILT, FOLLOWED BY A LIFE CYCLE APPLICATION PROCESS SCHEME FOR THE MANAGEMENT PLATFORM, SO THAT ALL PROJECT PARTICIPANTS MAY UNDERSTAND THEIR DUTIES IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS PAPER PROVIDES A REFERENCE FOR THE DEEPENING APPLICATION OF LIFE CYCLE SAFETY MANAGEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.","UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA","GUANGDONG UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"790528930@QQ.COM LUQIWANG@GDUT.EDU.CN 2207295873@QQ.COM 547186203@QQ.COM",NA,"CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY STRATEGIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (ICCREM 2022)","2024-12-23",NA,"BU7SL",NA,NA,"WANG, Y AND LIN, S AND SHEN, GQP","NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF GUANGDONG PROVINCE OF CHINA [2022A1515010106]; GUANGDONG BASIC AND APPLIED BASIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION REGIONAL JOINT FUND [2020A1515110799]","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF GUANGDONG PROVINCE OF CHINA (GRANT NUMBERS 2022A1515010106); GUANGDONG BASIC AND APPLIED BASIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION REGIONAL JOINT FUND (GRANT NUMBERS 2020A1515110799).","978-0-7844-8456-2",NA,NA,"CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY STRATEGIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (ICCREM 2022)","ENGLISH",NA,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT (ICCREM), ELECTR NETWORK, DEC 17-18, 2022","10",NA,NA,NA,"AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS; AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, CONSTRUCT INST; CHINA CONSTRUCT IND ASSOC, CONSTRUCT IND HIGH QUAL DEV INST; JOURNAL ENGN MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; HARBIN INST TECHNOL; JIANGXI CONSTRUCT ENGN CO LTD; HONG KONG POLYTECHN UNIV; TSINGHUA UNIV; UMEA UNIV; BEIJING UNIV CIVIL ENGN \& ARCHITECTURE; LOUISIANA STATE UNIV; UNIV ALBERTA; GUANGZHOU UNIV; MARQUETTE UNIV; NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV","419-426","AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENGINEERING","WANG, WEN/HKV-9621-2023",NA,0,"APPLICATION RESEARCH ON LIFE CYCLE SAFETY MANAGEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BASED ON BIM-4D","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000943603000045","1","16",NA,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2022,"YE HAOLIANG;WANG LUQI;CEN WENYI;FENG WEIMIN","WANG, LQ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL, GUANGZHOU, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY STRATEGIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (ICCREM 2022)","GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL;GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL","GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL",NA,"YE H, 2022, CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY STRATEGIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (ICCREM 2022)","YE H, 2022, CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY STRATEGIES OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (ICCREM 2022)",NA

THEREFORE, HOW TO CONSERVE THIS VALUABLE INFORMATION BECOMES A COMMON ISSUE FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE CONSERVATION IN THE WORLD. MANY RESEARCHES ABOUT CONSERVING THE INFORMATION OF WITHIN BUILT HERITAGES WERE DONE AND MORE ISSUES WERE RAISED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUILT HERITAGE AND NEW BUILDING IS THAT BUILT HERITAGE IS NOT FROM 0 BUT IT IS ALREADY EXIST. THIS DIFFERENCE CAUSE A BIG DIFFERENT FOR MODELLING PROCESS OF BUILT HERITAGE IN BIM ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THE INFORMATION OF THE 3D MODEL OF BUILT HERITAGE IS ADDED TO THE MODEL AFTER THE IT WAS CREATED. SO, WHAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSERVE AND WHAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO WHICH USER IS WORTH OF DISCUSSION. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO PROPOSE A DATA STRUCTURE, WHICH FULFILS THE REQUIREMENT OF USER, AND RESPECT THE STANDARD OF IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL CHART OF CONSERVATION. THE METHOD IS TO DEFINE A BASIC DATA STRUCTURE OF BUILT HERITAGE COMPONENTS AND EVALUATE IT LAYER BY LAYER. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT HBIM FOR BUILT HERITAGE, BY LINKING INFORMATION, CAN STORE MORE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND TAKE THE LOI OF LIFE CYCLE INTO CONSIDERATION SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE PROTOTYPICAL SCHEMA OF THIS STUDY MAY POSSIBLY BE AN UPPER LAYER CONCEPT FOR LATER RESEARCHES IN BOTH WESTERN AND EASTERN BUILT HERITAGE.","BAHNHOFSALLE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",NA,NA,"ALEXYEN@CUTE.EDU.TW KEVIN801006.CV03G@NCTU.EDU.TW",NA,"2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)","2024-12-23","10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W11-1159-2019","BP8XP","2194-9034",NA,"BRUMANA, R AND PRACCHI, V AND RINAUDO, F AND GRIMOLDI, A AND SCAIONI, M AND PREVITALI, M AND CANTINI, L",NA,NA,NA,"1682-1750",NA,"2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)","ENGLISH",NA,"2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES), MILAN, ITALY, MAY 08-10, 2019","15","11","GOLD",NA,"CARLETON UNIV, CARLETON IMMERS MEDIA STUDIO; MICROGEO SRL; GEOMAX SRL; STONEX SRL","1159-1163","COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","ARCHITECTURE; GEOGRAPHY; PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY; REMOTE SENSING",NA,"INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF THE PHOTOGRAMMETRY, REMOTE SENSING AND SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCES",2,"RESEARCH ON HBIM AND LEVEL OF INFORMATION FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE BUILT HERITAGE IN TAIWAN","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000568508700159","0","8","42-2","ARCHITECTURE; GEOGRAPHY; GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL; REMOTE SENSING","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S); CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SOCIAL SCIENCE &AMP; HUMANITIES (CPCI-SSH)",2019,"YEN Y N;LU Y C","YEN, YN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CHINA UNIV TECHNOL, CULTURAL PROPERTIES RES CTR CPRC, DEPT ARCHITECTURE, TAIPEI, TAIWAN","ISI","2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)","CHINA UNIV TECHNOL;CHINA UNIV TECHNOL;CHINA UNIV TECHNOL","CHINA UNIV TECHNOL",NA,"YEN YN, 2019, 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)","YEN YN, 2019, 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF GEOMATICS AND RESTORATION (GEORES 2019)",NA

CURRENTLY, THIS PROBLEM IS UNSOLVED WITH ONLY ONE STUDY ATTEMPTING TO INTEGRATE BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (SEPARATELY, BOTH PRACTICES ARE UTILISED TO FACILITATE THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF BUILDINGS, TRADITIONALLY CONSULTANCIES OFFER BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION SERVICES - MOST COMMONLY FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES - AND MORE RECENTLY LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS), WHILST NO WORK HAS ATTEMPTED THIS INTEGRATION IN A DYNAMIC MANNER. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING A DYNAMIC, OPEN BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING BASED CO-SIMULATION ARCHITECTURE. THIS ARCHITECTURE IS THE FIRST TO TIGHTLY COUPLE AND INTEGRATE ENERGYPLUS AND BRIGHTWAY2, IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT RELY UPON HEURISTICS OR SIMPLIFIED TOOLS. FURTHERMORE, IT IS THE FIRST BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESS-MENT CO-SIMULATION TO ENABLE TIME-DIFFERENTIATED (DYNAMIC) RESULTS AND THE FIRST TO BE ENABLED ONLY BY OPEN TECHNOLOGIES. THE ARCHITECTURE HAS BEEN VALIDATED AGAINST TWO CASE-STUDY NON-DOMESTIC BUILDINGS LOCATED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND LUXEMBOURG, DEMONSTRATING ITS APPLICABILITY TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONAL LIFE CYCLE PHASES OF BUILDINGS. THE WORK PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER HAS SHOWN HOW A TIME-DIFFERENTIATED CO-SIMULATION APPROACH ACROSS ENERGY AND LIFECYCLE DOMAINS ENABLES A MORE HOLISTIC ANALYSIS OF WHOLE BUILDINGS WITH GREATER ACCURACY AND GRANULARITY.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY; LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY","113419","YEUNGJ@CARDIFF.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.rser.2023.113419","K8XZ0","1879-0690","JUN 2023",NA,"ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) IN THE UK [EP/T019514/1, INTER/UKRI/19/14106247]; FOND NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE (FNR) IN LUXEMBOURG [EP/T019514/1, INTER/UKRI/19/14106247]","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) IN THE UK AND FOND NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE (FNR) IN LUXEMBOURG FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE RESEARCH UNDER GRANT AGREEMENT (EP/T019514/1; INTER/UKRI/19/14106247).",NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EXISTING STUDY THAT FOCUSES ON MAPPING THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OF THE LCAS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WITH A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING. HENCE, AN EXPANSIVE AND MACRO LEVEL STUDY OF THE LCAS WITHIN THE SUBJECT DOMAIN IS NECESSARY TO FULFILL THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO REVEAL THE STATUS QUO, HOT TOPICS AND KEYWORDS, AND EMERGING AREAS OF THE LCA RESEARCH IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, SYSTEMATIC BIBLIOMETRIC AND SCIENTOMETRIC ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED BY REFERRING 2885 BIBLIOMETRIC RECORDS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1997 AND 2021 (END OF FEBRUARY). THE ANALYSES INDICATED CHINA, USA, AND SPAIN AS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE COUNTRIES IN THE FIELD. ADDITIONALLY, HOT KEYWORDS IN THE DOMAIN REVEALED AS `ENERGY', `ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT', `SUSTAINABILITY', `PERFORMANCE', `EMISSION', `BUILDING', `SYSTEM', `DESIGN', AND `CONCRETE'. `CIRCULAR ECONOMY', `MECHANICAL PROPERTY', AND `FOOTPRINT' ARE FOUND AS THE EMERGING AREAS OF THIS FIELD. DOCUMENT CO-CITATION CLUSTERS SHOWED THE HOT RESEARCH THEMES OF THE DOMAIN AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM), ENERGY PERFORMANCE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION WASTE, CARBONATION, WATER SUPPLY, BRIDGE DESIGN, OPTIMIZATION, PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT, VENTILATION, AND DESIGN ASSESSMENT. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS BY PROVIDING AN INCLUSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RECENT STATUS, HOT KEYWORDS AND TOPICS, AND EMERGING AREAS OF THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. FURTHER, THIS STUDY WOULD BE A USEFUL AND VALUABLE REFERENCE AND GUIDELINE FOR THE RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN THIS FIELD.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","BOGAZICI UNIVERSITY; OZYEGIN UNIVERSITY","108086","YILDIRAY.YILMAZ@BOUN.EDU.TR SENEM.SEYIS@OZYEGIN.EDU.TR",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108086","UK2PT","1873-684X","JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0360-1323","BUILD.

SINCE ENVELOPE OPTIMIZATION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF GREEN BUILDINGS, VALUE ENGINEERING (VE) TECHNOLOGY AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY ARE USED TO OPTIMIZE THE ENVELOPE OF GREEN BUILDINGS, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ENERGY SAVING AND LIFE CYCLE COST. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF OPTIMIZATION FOR GREEN BUILDING ENVELOPE BASED ON BIM-VE IS PROPOSED, INCLUDING A BIM MODEL FOR ARCHITECTURE, A LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS MODEL, ENERGY-SAVING ANALYSIS MODEL, AND A VALUE ANALYSIS MODEL. IN THE LIFE-CYCLE COST MODEL, A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR THE LIFE-CYCLE COST IS ESTABLISHED, AND BIM TECHNOLOGY IS USED TO GENERATE A BILL OF QUANTITY. IN THE ENERGY-SAVING ANALYSIS MODEL, A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR ENERGY SAVING IS ESTABLISHED, AND BIM TECHNOLOGY IS USED FOR THE BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION. IN THE SCHEME DECISION-MAKING SUB-MODEL, VE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATING LIFE CYCLE COST WITH ENERGY SAVING IS USED TO ASSESS THE ENVELOPE SCHEMES AND SELECT THE OPTIMAL ONE. A PREFABRICATED PROJECT CASE IS USED TO SIMULATE AND TEST THE ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY. THE IMPORTANT RESULTS SHOW THAT THE 16 ENVELOPE SCHEMES MAKE THE 16 CORRESPONDING DESIGNED BUILDINGS MEET THE GREEN BUILDING EVALUATION STANDARDS, AND THE OPTIMAL ENVELOPE SCHEME IS THE ``ENERGY-SAVING AND ANTI-THEFT DOOR + EXTERIOR WINDOW 2+ FLOOR 1+ EXTERIOR WALL 1 + INNER SHEAR WALL + INNER PARTITION WALL 2 + PLANTED ROOF'' WITH THE VALUE 10.80 X 10(-2) MW CENTER DOT H/TEN THOUSAND YUAN. A SIGNIFICANT FINDING IS THAT THE VALUE GENERALLY RISES WITH THE INCREASE OF ENERGY-SAVING RATE WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST IS IRREGULAR WITH THE INCREASE OF ENERGY-SAVING RATE. COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS EFFORTS IN THE LITERATURE, THIS STUDY INTRODUCES VE TECHNOLOGY INTO ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN TO FURTHER EXPAND THE CURRENT BOUNDARY OF BUILDING ENERGY-SAVING THEORY. THE FINDINGS AND SUGGESTIONS WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE REFERENCE AND GUIDANCE FOR THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN INDUSTRY TO OPTIMIZE THE ENVELOPE OF GREEN BUILDINGS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH ENERGY SAVING AND LIFE CYCLE COST.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","CHINA UNIVERSITY OF MINING \& TECHNOLOGY; CHINA UNIVERSITY OF MINING \& TECHNOLOGY; HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","7862","TBH171@CUMT.EDU.CN ZHOUJIANLIANG@CUMT.EDU.CN YANING.QIAO@CUMT.EDU.CN SDZYD100@163.COM LDD\_2019@163.COM 15706298215@163.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su12197862","ON2FQ","2071-1050",NA,NA,"FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [2020QN73]; HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION OF CHINA'S EDUCATION MINISTRY [19YJAZH122]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51878026]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES (PROJECT NO. 2020QN73), THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION OF CHINA'S EDUCATION MINISTRY (PROJECT NO. 19YJAZH122), AND THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (PROJECT NO. 51878026).",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","OCT",NA,"52","19","GOLD, GREEN PUBLISHED","QIAO, YANING/0000-0002-9051-8406",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","LIU, DAN/JVN-8346-2024 周, 建亮/GQQ-5306-2022 ",NA,24,"BIM-VE-BASED OPTIMIZATION OF GREEN BUILDING ENVELOPE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH ENERGY SAVING AND LIFE CYCLE COST","ARTICLE","WOS000586524100001","8","124","12","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2020,"YUAN ZHENMIN;ZHOU JIANLIANG;QIAO YANING;ZHANG YADI; LIU DANDAN;ZHU HUI","ZHOU, JL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CHINA UNIV MIN \& TECHNOL, SCH MECH \& CIVIL ENGN, XUZHOU 221116, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","CHINA UNIV MIN AND TECHNOL;CHINA UNIV MIN AND TECHNOL;CHINA UNIV MIN AND TECHNOL;CHINA UNIV MIN AND TECHNOL;SCH CIVIL ENGN","CHINA UNIV MIN AND TECHNOL",NA,"YUAN Z, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY","YUAN Z, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

THIS REVIEW AIMS TO EXPLORE THE USE OF AI TO ENHANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE, INCLUDING BUILDING DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND CONTROL, MAINTENANCE, AND RETROFIT. THE REVIEW ENCOMPASSES MULTIPLE STUDIES IN THE FIELD PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2018 AND 2023. THESE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH KEYWORD SEARCHES THAT BEST REPRESENT THE TOPIC, USING VARIOUS RESEARCH DATABASES. IN ADDITION TO SUMMARIZING THE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES RELATED TO AI AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE APPLICATION OF AI IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITHIN THESE LIFECYCLE STAGES. THE REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THAT AI-BASED SOLUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN BUILDING DESIGN GENERATION AND OPTIMIZATION, DECISION-MAKING, PREDICTIVE AND ADAPTIVE CONTROL, FAULT DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS, AS WELL AS ENERGY BENCHMARKING.

THIS RESULTS IN UNINFORMED DECISION-MAKING WHICH IMPACTS ON ACTUAL BUILDING PERFORMANCE, IN PARTICULAR WHOLE LIFE COSTS (WLC). IT IS PROPOSED THAT BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE DESIGN APPROACH FROM THE INITIAL STAGES IF THE MODEL CAN UTILIZE RELIABLE AND ROBUST COST AND PERFORMANCE DATA FROM BUILDINGS IN USE. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE INITIAL FINDINGS OF A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT HAS INVESTIGATED THE INTEGRATION OF WLC ESTIMATION INTO BIM PROCESSES. THE STUDY FOCUSSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE RAPIDLY EMERGING PRIVATE RENTAL SECTOR (PRS) AS THE BUILD-TO-RENT MARKET HAS REPEATABLE TASKS AND SIMILAR WORKFLOW PATTERNS, ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT IMPACTS OF WLC CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE BUSINESS MODEL. THE STUDY ADOPTED A MIXED METHOD APPROACH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A STRUCTURED STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR TIMELY WLC ESTIMATION THROUGH BIM. THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF BARRIERS. THESE INCLUDED VARYING DEFINITIONS OF WLC CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES; THE AVAILABILITY AND STANDARDS OF DATA SOURCES, IN PARTICULAR, THE MISALIGNMENT OF CODING SYSTEMS FOR IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF COMPONENTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT, PROPRIETARY OWNERSHIP OF DATA, LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN TEAM MEMBERS TO PRODUCE AND/OR UTILIZE DATA SOURCES, AND LIMITATIONS OF SOFTWARE. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH PROPOSES THAT THESE MAY BE ADDRESSED BY A REVERSE-ENGINEERED SYSTEMATIC PROCESS THAT USES THE INTEGRATED DEFINITION (IDEF) 3 STRUCTURED DIAGRAMMING MODELLING TECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO A SOFTWARE MODEL AND HAS DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR BIM-ENABLED WLC ASSESSMENT BASED ON CE PRINCIPLES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ACCESS TO LIVE DATA STREAMS FROM COMPLETED BUILDINGS. THE PAPER DESCRIBES THIS MODEL DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE BIM LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT THROUGH AN AUGMENTED DECISION-MAKING APPROACH THAT IS INTEGRAL TO THE NATURAL DESIGN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","GLASGOW SCHOOL OF ART","114","M.ZANNI@CARTWRIGHTPICKARD.COM T.SHARPE@GSA.AC.UK P.LAMMERS@CARTWRIGHTPICKARD.COM L.ARNOLD@CARTWRIGHTPICKARD.COM J.PICKARD@CARTWRIGHTPICKARD.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings9050114","IE9BT","2075-5309",NA,NA,"INNOVATE UK FOR KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER PARTNERSHIP","WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM INNOVATE UK FOR KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER PARTNERSHIP FUNDING.",NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","MAY",NA,"110","5","GOLD, GREEN SUBMITTED, GREEN PUBLISHED, GREEN ACCEPTED","SHARPE, TIM/0000-0002-4275-5351 ZANNI, MARIANGELA/0000-0001-9018-6803",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","ZANNI, MARIANGELA/AAJ-2779-2021 ",NA,13,"DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY FOR INTEGRATION OF WHOLE LIFE COSTS INTO BIM PROCESSES TO ASSIST DESIGN DECISION MAKING","ARTICLE","WOS000472670000012","7","51","9","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2019,"ZANNI MARIANGELA;SHARPE TIM;LAMMERS PHILIPP;ARNOLD LEO;PICKARD JAMES","ZANNI, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CARTWRIGHT PICKARD, 1 CANAL SIDE STUDIOS,8-14 ST PANCRAS WAY, LONDON NW1 0QG, ENGLAND","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);GLASGOW SCH ART;GLASGOW SCH ART","M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR)",NA,"ZANNI M, 2019, BUILDINGS-BASEL","ZANNI M, 2019, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

THE TROMBE WALL (THERMAL STORAGE WALL-TSW) IS AN INDIRECT PASSIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM SOLUTION, AIMED AT OBTAINING, STORING, AND TRANSFERRING THERMAL ENERGY INTO BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE USE OF SUCH SOLUTIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDINGS, ESPECIALLY THOSE LOCATED IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS THEREFORE TO DETERMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF BARRIERS USING PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS (PCM) FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF A MODEL BUILDING CONFORMING TO THE CURRENT POLISH ENERGY STANDARD (EP < 70 KWH/(M(2)CENTER DOT YR)). THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE STRUCTURE OF A TSW USING PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS AND A REFERENCE WALL WITH A MAXIMUM OVERALL HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT OF 0.2 W/M(2)K. A COMPREHENSIVE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING LOCATED IN RZESZ \& OACUTE;W, POLAND, WAS CREATED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE THERMAL PARAMETERS OF THE ANALYZED STRUCTURE OF THE WALL AND ITS OPERATION UNDER REAL, SPECIFIC CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS.

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF WHOLE LIFE CARBON (WLC) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS HINDERED BY SEVERAL CHALLENGES. THESE INCLUDE GAPS IN STAKEHOLDERS' KNOWLEDGE, LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF LCA DATA ON CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS AND BUILDINGS, INSUFFICIENT MARKET INCENTIVES, AND LOW INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED AS PART OF THE INDICATE PROJECT, AIMS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS OF WLC CALCULATION AND ESTABLISH A CONSISTENT NATIONAL ASSESSMENT METHOD SPECIFIC TO THE CZECH CONTEXT. THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES VARIOUS PHASES, I.E., A CASE STUDY COLLECTION OF OFFICE, MULTI-FAMILY, SINGLE-FAMILY, EDUCATION, AND LOGISTIC HALL BUILDINGS, FOLLOWED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED MATERIALS DATABASE, CLASSIFICATION OF BUILDING PARTS AND UNIFORM WORK WITH THE BILL OF QUANTITIES, STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, AN LCA OF CASE STUDIES WITH A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND WLC POLICY SUGGESTIONS, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT DATA, SIMPLIFICATIONS, AND A BENCHMARKS DEFINITION. THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) IS CALCULATED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF EACH CONSIDERED BUILDING, UTILIZING THE EU LEVEL(S) METHODOLOGY INCORPORATED IN THE ONECLICK LCA SOFTWARE. BY ADHERING TO THESE NEWLY DEVELOPED METHODOLOGICAL STEPS, BENCHMARKS FOR MULTI-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ARE SHOWN. THE SAME METHODOLOGY COULD BE REPLICATED BY STAKEHOLDERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO ENHANCE THEIR EVALUATION PROCESSES AND ENSURE CONSISTENT RESULTS ACROSS THEIR PROJECTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY PRAGUE","1936","JULIE.ZELEZNA@CVUT.CZ LICIA.FELICIONI@CVUT.CZ NIKA.TRUBINA@CVUT.CZ BARBORA.VLASATA@CVUT.CZ JAN.RUZICKA@CVUT.CZ JAKUB.VESELKA@CVUT.CZ",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings14071936","ZP7J4","2075-5309",NA,NA,"LAUDES FOUNDATION [GR-077634]","THIS PAPER WAS FUNDED THROUGH THE INDICATE FRAMEWORK VIA A GRANT FROM THE LAUDES FOUNDATION (GRANT NUMBER GR-077634)",NA,NA,"BUILDINGS-BASEL","BUILDINGS","ENGLISH","JUL",NA,"65","7","GOLD","VESELKA, JAKUB/0000-0002-5108-6575 FELICIONI, LICIA/0000-0003-0133-6887 TRUBINA, NIKA/0009-0006-2440-1433",NA,NA,"MDPI","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING","VESELKA, JAKUB/IWD-8964-2023 FELICIONI, LICIA/AAX-1529-2020 ",NA,0,"WHOLE LIFE CARBON ASSESSMENT OF BUILDINGS: THE PROCESS TO DEFINE CZECH NATIONAL BENCHMARKS","ARTICLE","WOS001276562200001","5","5","14","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED)",2024,"ZELEZNA JULIE;FELICIONI LICIA;TRUBINA NIKA;VLASATA; BARBORA;RUZICKA JAN;VESELKA JAKUB","FELICIONI, L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CZECH TECH UNIV, UNIV CTR ENERGY EFFICIENT BLDG, TRINECKA 1024, BUSTEHRAD 27343, CZECH REPUBLIC","ISI","BUILDINGS-BASEL","CZECH TECH UNIV;CZECH TECH UNIV","CZECH TECH UNIV",NA,"ZELEZNA J, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL","ZELEZNA J, 2024, BUILDINGS-BASEL",NA

WITH MORE JOINT APPLICATIONS OF BOTH BIM AND ROBOTICS BEING EXPOSED, THE COMPATIBILITY OF BIM FOR ROBOTIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY KEY TO FURTHER PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN INTEGRATED REVIEW COMBINING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES TO CLARIFY THE DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP OF BIM-ENABLED BUILDING AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS. FIRSTLY, INFORMATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT IN DIGITAL TWIN AND ROBOTIC BUILDING TASKS IS RECAPPED AS THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. SECONDLY, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON BIM-RELATED RESEARCH TOPICS IN THE LAST 18 YEARS IS CONDUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE INEVITABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF BIM-ROBOT INTEGRATION, INFORMED BY THE EVOLUTION OF LIFECYCLE BUILDING INFORMATION FLOW. THEN, CRITICAL ANALYSIS ON THREE TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF BIM-BASED ROBOTIC CONSTRUCTION (I.E. PRINTING, ASSEMBLING, AND WELDING) ARE SUCCESSIVELY PERFORMED TO REFLECT THE POTENTIAL BIM-ROBOT INTEGRATION MECHANISM AND CHALLENGES AHEAD. FINALLY, A NEW UNIFIED ROBOT-ORIENTED BIM FRAMEWORK, NAMELY BIMFAR, IS PROPOSED TO CONCLUDE THE COGITATION BASED ON THE ABOVE ANALYSES. UNDER THE BIMFAR FRAMEWORK, DEFINITIONS OF BASIC CONCEPTS AND A PRACTICAL WORKFLOW ARE DISCUSSED TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE APPLICATIONS. (C) 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF APPLYING BIM TECHNOLOGY IS ESTABLISHING THE RATIONALITY AND CONCISE ENGINEERING BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (EBS) CODING. HOWEVER, CHINA HAS NO UNIFORM EBS CODING STANDARD FOR HIGHWAYS, WHICH LIMITS BIM TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE SAME CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROPOSE AN EBS STANDARD THAT EMBODIES A CODING SYSTEM FOR HIGHWAYS AND AT THE SAME TIME MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF BIM MANAGEMENT, PROJECT MANAGEMENT (PM), AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT (OM) IN LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EBS STANDARD BASED ON THREE CLASSIFICATIONS: (1) PROJECT-LEVEL CONSTRUCTION, (2) PROJECT-LEVEL OPERATION, AND (3) NETWORK-LEVEL OPERATION. A CASE STUDY IS GIVEN TO ILLUSTRATE THE PROPOSED EBS STANDARD'S CODING SYSTEM. THE NEW EBS SYSTEM WILL HAVE BETTER ADAPTABILITY IN BOTH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STAGES. THE PROPOSED EBS CODING SYSTEM HAS BEEN APPLIED IN MANY PROJECTS AND IS UNDERGOING BOTH IMPROVEMENT AND STANDARDIZATION IN CHINA. THE PRESENTED EBS CODING STANDARD PROVIDES SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCES FOR THE FUTURE ADOPTION AND USE OF BIM ON PM AND OM IN HIGHWAY PROJECTS.","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA","1581036","ZLYUSE@126.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1155/2019/1581036","IW0WZ","1687-8094",NA,NA,"NATIONAL KEY R\&D PROGRAM OF CHINA [2018YFB1600302, 2018YFB1600300, 2018YFC0809606, 2018YFC0809600]; BEIJING NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [8192046]; PROJECT OF BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OPERATING EXPENSES OF RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF HIGHWAY MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT [2019-0102, 2018-9025, 2018-9027]; MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA [2015318J38230]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL KEY R\&D PROGRAM OF CHINA (2018YFB1600302, 2018YFB1600300, 2018YFC0809606, AND 2018YFC0809600), BEIJING NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (8192046), PROJECT OF BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OPERATING EXPENSES OF RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF HIGHWAY MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT (2019-0102, 2018-9025, AND 2018-9027), AND MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (2015318J38230).

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE QUANTIFICATION OF EMISSIONS, YET THE ISSUE OF UNCERTAINTIES NEEDS TO BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED. IN GENERAL, THE UNCERTAINTY IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT IS MAINLY DUE TO THE ERRORS IN INPUT PARAMETERS, DEFINITION OF SYSTEM BOUNDARY AND SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHOICE OF ANALYTICAL MODELS, WHICH COULD BE SUMMARIZED AS PARAMETER, SCENARIO, AND MODEL UNCERTAINTIES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, DATA QUALITY INDICATORS WERE ADOPTED AND A SEMI-QUANTITATIVE METHOD WAS MODELED ACCORDINGLY, RELEVANT TO THE UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF BUILDING EMISSION ASSESSMENT. A CASE STUDY BUILDING WAS ANALYZED COMPARING THE DETERMINISTIC AND STOCHASTIC APPROACHES, AND THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN INPUT PARAMETERS COULD RESULT IN A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 3106 TCO(2E) FOR THE SAMPLE MEAN OF 61504 TCO(2E), WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE DETERMINISTIC RESULTS. FURTHER SCENARIO ANALYSES INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF SCENARIO AND MODELLING ALTERNATIVES. RELEVANT RESULTS EMPHASIZED THE DEFINITION OF SYSTEM BOUNDARY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO CONTROL UNCERTAINTIES, AND SUGGESTED APPLYING STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTION FOR KEY PARAMETERS IN ANALYSIS. OVERALL, THE PRESENT STUDY COULD PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ON THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE CYCLE EMISSION ASSESSMENT, AND, THEREFORE, BE HELPFUL IN DECISION-MAKING REGARDING THE LOW-CARBON DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING INDUSTRY.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","NINGBO UNIVERSITY; HARBIN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"ZHANGXIAOCUN@NBU.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.016","HE4LN","1873-684X",NA,NA,"K.C.

BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON THE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS OF CHINESE HOSPITALS, THIS STUDY CONDUCTED A DETAILED CARBON-ACCOUNTING AND COMPARATIVE STUDY. FIRSTLY, BIM AND LCA WERE USED TO QUANTIFY THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE INPATIENT BUILDING IN EACH STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE. SECONDLY, THE DIFFERENCES IN CARBON EMISSIONS BY STAGE WERE COMPARED ON THE BASIS OF 20 CASES OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE WHOLE-LIFE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE INPATIENT BUILDING WAS 10,459.94 KGCO2/M2. THE PROPORTION OF OPERATIONAL CARBON EMISSIONS WAS 94.68\%, WITH HVAC (52.57\%), EQUIPMENT (27.85\%), AND LIGHTING (10.11\%) BEING THE MAIN SOURCES. EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTED FOR 4.54\%, AND HRB400 STEEL AND C30 CONCRETE WERE THE MAIN SOURCES OF CARBON EMISSIONS. HOSPITALS ARE SECOND ONLY TO EMPORIUMS IN TERMS OF OPERATIONAL CARBON INTENSITY, BEING 1.71 AND 1.41 TIMES THAT OF SCHOOLS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS, WITH INPATIENT BUILDINGS BEING 3 AND 1.7 TIMES THAT OF MEDICAL COMPLEXES AND OUTPATIENT BUILDINGS, RESPECTIVELY. THE FUTURE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF HOSPITAL BUILDINGS SHOULD PROMOTE EFFICIENT BUILDING PERFORMANCE AND GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, BOTH IN TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CARBON REDUCTION.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"5341","GUOCHENG1107@163.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/su16135341","YQ5Z6","2071-1050",NA,NA,"RESEARCH FUND OF CHINA, ACADEMY OF BUILDING RESEARCH [20220111330730018]; RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION OF LOW CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DESIGN METHODS AND KEY TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOSPITALS AND BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY BUILDINGS [20220106330730007]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE RESEARCH FUND OF CHINA, ACADEMY OF BUILDING RESEARCH (20220111330730018), AND RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION OF LOW CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DESIGN METHODS AND KEY TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOSPITALS AND BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY BUILDINGS (GRANT NO.20220106330730007).",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JUL",NA,"64","13","GOLD",NA,NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","WANG, QINGQIN/JHT-0846-2023",NA,3,"USING BIM AND LCA TO CALCULATE THE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS OF INPATIENT BUILDING: A CASE STUDY IN CHINA","ARTICLE","WOS001269975400001","24","24","16","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2024,"ZHAO LI;GUO CHENG;CHEN LEDUAN;QIU LIPING;WU WEIWEI;WANG QINGQIN","GUO, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CHINA ACAD BLDG RES, BEIJING 100013, PEOPLES R CHINA","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","CHINA ACAD BLDG RES;CHINA ACAD BLDG RES","CHINA ACAD BLDG RES",NA,"ZHAO L, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY","ZHAO L, 2024, SUSTAINABILITY",NA

HOWEVER, EXISTING METHODS FOR ESTIMATING WLCE ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND DATA-INTENSIVE, LIMITING THEIR USEFULNESS IN THE EARLY BUILDING DESIGN STAGES. IN RESPONSE TO THIS, THIS RESEARCH INTRODUCES A NOVEL APPROACH BY HARNESSING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT WLCE AND WLCE INTENSITY (NORMALISED BY FLOOR AREA) FOR BUILDINGS. TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT INVOLVING TEN ALGORITHMS TO BUILD THE PREDICTION MODELS. THESE MODELS WERE TRAINED USING DATA FROM 150 TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN CORNWALL, UK, ALONG WITH 28 FEATURES OBTAINED FROM A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY, INCLUDING FLOOR AREA, HEATING TYPE, AND OCCUPANT CHARACTERISTICS. THE TEN ALGORITHMS INCLUDE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION, AND NON-LINEAR ALGORITHMS SUCH AS DECISION TREE, RANDOM FOREST. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION METRICS, SUCH AS COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R2), MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE), MEANS SQUARED ERROR (MSE), ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERROR (RMSE), AND ELAPSED TIME, WERE EMPLOYED. OUR RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIELD BY SHOWCASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS IN PREDICTING BUILDING WLCE. WE REVEAL THAT ALL THE TESTED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PREDICT WLCE AND WLCE INTENSITY, NON-LINEAR MODELS OUTPERFORM LINEAR ONES, AND THE RANDOM FOREST (RF) MODEL DEMONSTRATES SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF ACCURACY, STABILITY, AND EFFICIENCY. THIS RESEARCH ENCOURAGES THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE CYCLE STUDIES INTO THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE, EVEN WITHIN TIGHT BUILDING DESIGN SCHEDULES, OFFERING PRACTICAL GUIDANCE TO ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS. FURTHERMORE, THESE RESULTS ALSO BENEFIT A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS, NOT ONLY THE ARCHITECTS BUT ALSO THE ENGINEERS, POLICYMAKERS, AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) RESEARCHERS, CONTRIBUTING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF DATA-DRIVEN SUSTAINABILITY APPROACHES WITHIN THE BUILDING SECTOR.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER","122472","XIAOYU.YAN@EXETER.AC.UK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122472","ER9L7","1872-9118","DEC 2023",NA,"CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; SMARTLINE PROJECT (ENGLAND EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND) [05R16P00305, 05R18P02819]","LIN ZHENG WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HER PHD FROM THE CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL AND THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER.

THE INTRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN ENERGY WITH HIGH OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY ENABLES THE MULTI-ENERGY COMPLEMENTARY SYSTEM TO FULLY ACCOMMODATE RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE KEY ISSUES OF THE OPTIMIZATION PLANNING OF THE WIND-PHOTOVOLTAIC-HYDROGEN MULTI-ENERGY COMPLEMENTARY SYSTEM THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED ARE HOW TO FINELY CHARACTERIZE THE CARBON REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF THE SYSTEM, CONSIDER THE UNCERTAINTY OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE MODELING PROCESS, AND INCORPORATE THE ENERGY SUPPLY BUSINESS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES INTO THE PLANNING. THIS STUDY CONSTRUCTS OPTIMIZATION PLANNING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING THREE PROGRESSIVE STAGES: GEOSPATIAL SUITABILITY SIMULATION BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM, UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS BASED ON PROBABILISTIC SCENE GENERATION TECHNOLOGY, AND CAPACITY CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATION. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS MODEL MEASURES AND OPTIMIZES THE CARBON EMISSIONS LEVEL OF THE SYSTEM FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY RESULTS INDICATE THAT CARBON EMISSIONS OPTIMIZATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION RESULTS. FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE, THE CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING RESULT IS ABOUT 9 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OBTAINED ONLY DURING THE OPERATION PHASE. COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED IN THIS STUDY DECREASED BY 82.75 \%. IN ADDITION, CONSIDERING THAT THE SYSTEM PROVIDES CHARGING SERVICES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, WHICH CAN REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY ABOUT 93.6 \% BUT ONLY INCREASE COSTS BY ABOUT 29.4 \%. THE COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS JUSTIFY THE PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. THIS STUDY PROVIDES OPTIMIZATION MODELS FOR THE SYSTEM, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK CAN SUPPORT TECHNICAL REFERENCE FOR PRACTICE.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","XINJIANG UNIVERSITY; XINJIANG UNIVERSITY; BEIJING UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; NORTH CHINA ELECTRIC POWER UNIVERSITY","119103","15652112686@163.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enconman.2024.119103","I3P9O","1879-2227","SEP 2024",NA,"NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION [2022D01C665]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS REGION UNIVERSITIES [XJEDU2022P023]; RESEARCH FUND FOR HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION [23YJCZH328]; MAJOR PROJECT OF NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA [21ZD133]","THIS RESEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION (2022D01C665) , THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS REGION UNIVERSITIES (XJEDU2022P023) , THE RESEARCH FUND FOR HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (23YJCZH328) , AND THE MAJOR PROJECT OF NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA (21\&ZD133) .

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT LITERATURE INDICATES LIMITED PROGRESS IN THE TECHNO-ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF POSITIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEMS, WITH CONSIDERATIONS ON BATTERY CYCLING AGING, DEGRADATION OF HYBRID RENEWABLE GENERATIONS, AND DYNAMIC GRID-RESPONSIVE CONTROL STRATEGY. IN THIS STUDY, AN INTERACTIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEM WAS MATHEMATICALLY FORMULATED WITH MULTIDIRECTIONAL ENERGY INTERACTION PARADIGMS, SUCH AS BUILDING-TO-VEHICLE, GRID-TO-BUILDING, BUILDING-TO-GRID, AND GRID-TO-VEHICLE. THE ROLES OF THE V2B INTERACTION LEVELS, GRID FEED-IN SCHEMES, AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN TECHNO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCES WERE QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERISED, FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV), DISCOUNTED PAYBACK TIME (DPT), AND NET DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION. NOVEL ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WERE PROPOSED FOR BATTERY RELATIVE CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE DYNAMIC RENEWABLE-DEMAND SIGNAL AND GRID INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED ON THE RENEWABLE SYSTEM COST, BATTERY COST, INTEREST RATE, AND ESCALATION RATE OF THE ELECTRICITY PRICE. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IGNORANCE OF BATTERY CYCLING AGING RESULTS IN AN OVERESTIMATION ON NPV FROM 2.404 X 10(8) (0.310 X 10(8) US\$) TO 3.005 X 10(8) HK\$ (0.388 X 10(8) US\$). FURTHERMORE, COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL ROUGH ESTIMATION ON BATTERY AGING (WITH THE NPV AT 2.446 X 10(8) HK\$ AND THE DPT AT 4 YEARS), THE DYNAMIC MODEL IN THIS STUDY CAN PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE BATTERY RELATIVE CAPACITY, TOGETHER WITH CONSERVATIVE ASSESSMENT ON TECHNO-ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY (THE NPV AT 1.860 X 108 HK\$ (0.240 X 10(8) US\$) AND THE DPT AT 5 YEARS). IN COMPARISON WITH THE GRID FEED-IN TARIFF POLICIES IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LATEST GRID FEED-IN TARIFF IN HONG KONG CAN INCREASE THE NPV FROM -7.633 X 107 (-0.985 X 10(8) US\$) TO 2.303 X 10(8) HK\$ (0.297 X 10(8) US\$) FOR THE POSITIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEM. AN INTERACTIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEM WAS FORMULATED, TOGETHER WITH ADVANCED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR LIFECYCLE-BASED TECHNO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES AMONG SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT CONTROL STRATEGIES, V2B INTERACTION LEVELS, AND GRID FEED-IN TARIFF SCHEMES WERE PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE RELIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE FOR POSITIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEMS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY; HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY","113473","SUNLIANG.CAO@POLYU.EDU.HK",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113473","PL7YW","1879-2227",NA,NA,"HK RGC (HONG KONG RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL) RESEARCH PROJECT [25215618]","THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY HK RGC (HONG KONG RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL) RESEARCH PROJECT 25215618 (THE OPTIMAL TRANSITIONS FROM INTERACTIVELY-ISOLATED SYSTEMS TO THE MUTUALLY-INTEGRATED UNITY BETWEEN ZERO-ENERGY BUILDING(S) AND ZERO-ENERGY VEHICLE(S)).",NA,"0196-8904","ENERGY CONV.

IMPROVEMENTS IN BUILDING DESIGN CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDINGS. IN THIS CONTEXT, A CRUCIAL ISSUE IS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH DESIGN VARIABLES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHILE WHICH VARIABLES COULD BE NEGLIGIBLE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR AS-SESSING THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS DESIGN VARIABLES THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS IN THE ENVIRON-MENTAL IMPACTS OF A BUILDING OVER ITS LIFE CYCLE. THIS METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK COMBINED BUILD-ING INFORMATION MODELLING AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND A GLOBAL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING THE MORRIS ELEMENTARY EFFECTS METHOD. A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WAS APPLIED TO DEMONSTRATE THE DE-VELOPED FRAMEWORK. THE INFLUENCE OF SIX DESIGN VARIABLES IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES (INCLUDING, FLOOR AREA, ASPECT RATIO, FLOOR HEIGHT, ORIENTATION, WINDOW-TO-WALL RATIO AND NUMBER OF FLOORS), NINE VARIABLES IN DETAILED DESIGN STAGES (INCLUDING, STRUCTURE TYPE OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL WALLS, TYPE OF INSULATION MATERIAL FOR EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL WALLS, INSULATION MATERIAL FOR FLOORS, WATERPROOF-ING AND INSULATION MATERIAL FOR ROOF, TYPE OF WINDOW FRAME, AND GLAZING TYPE), AND FOUR VARIABLES IN CONSTRUCTION DESIGN STAGES (INCLUDING, TYPE OF FINISHING FOR EXTERNAL WALLS, INTERNAL WALLS AND FLOORS, AND ROOF TILES) ARE EXAMINED. THREE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CRITERIA (INCLUDING, EMBODIED, OPERATIONAL, AND LIFE-CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS) OF A BUILDING ARE CONSIDERED. THE RESULTS IDEN-TIFIED THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VARIABLES THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS, HIGHLIGHTING ASPECT RATIO IN EARLY DESIGN STAGE, THE STRUCTURE AND INSULATION MATERIALS FOR WALLS IN DETAILED DESIGN STAGES, AND THE ROOF TITLE IN CONSTRUCTION DESIGN STAGES. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS RESEARCH CAN ASSIST IN UNDER-STANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN VARIABLES IN EACH DESIGN STAGE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS OF A BUILDING.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY","105749","VIVIANWYTAM@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105749","H7NB6","2352-7102","DEC 2022",NA,"AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ARC); AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT [DP190100559, DP200100057, IH200100010]","THE AUTHORS WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ARC) , AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT (NO: DP190100559, DP200100057, IH200100010) .",NA,NA,"J.

HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES MADE STRONG ASSUMPTIONS TO AVOID MODELLING SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF CARBON FOOTPRINTS OR IGNORE WEATHER AND SHADOWING EFFECTS ON PV ELECTRICITY GENERATION, MAKING THE ESTIMATED RESULTS UNRELIABLE AND EVEN CAUSING FALSE POLICYMAKING. TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE, WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL MODEL COUPLING MULTI -SOURCED DATA MODELLING AND LIFE -CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO ESTIMATE SPATIALLY HETEROGENOUS CARBON MITIGATION OF ALL THE OPERATIONAL ROOFTOP PVS IN AN ENTIRE CITY. IT IS BUILT BY THREE HIERARCHAL MODULES: (I) SEGMENTING PV AREAS FROM HIGH -RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY, BY USING DEEP SOLAR PV REFINER, AN ADVANCED SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION NETWORK; (II) ESTIMATING ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE SEGMENTED PV AREAS, BY USING A WELL -DEVELOPED 3D SOLAR IRRADIATION MODEL THAT CONSIDERS THE EFFECTS OF LAND SURFACE SOLAR IRRADIATION INFLUENCED BY WEATHER AND SHADOWING EFFECTS PRODUCED BY 3D BUILDINGS; (III) QUANTIFYING CARBON MITIGATION POTENTIAL OF PVS, BY DEVELOPING A SPATIAL -AWARE LIFE -CYCLE MODEL TO TRACK THE LIFE -CYCLE CARBON FOOTPRINTS OF PVS FROM PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, OPERATION, TO DECOMMISSION. INVESTIGATING SINGAPORE BY 2020, WE REVEAL THAT INDUSTRIAL, AIRPORT, AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS HAVE THE LARGEST ROOFTOP PV INSTALLATION. WE ALSO SUGGEST A CARBON EMISSION RATE OF 13.20 G-CO 2 /KWH, A CARBON PAYBACK TIME OF 0.81 YEARS, AND AN ENERGY PAYBACK TIME OF 0.94 YEARS, SHOWING AN IMPROVED CARBON MITIGATION CAPABILITY COMPARED TO THE PAST YEARS.

THE P-BIM FRAMEWORK AND THE OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY BUILT ON IT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED CAN EXPAND THE APPLICATION SCOPE OF BIM AND CONTRIBUTE TO DATADRIVEN GREEN BUILDING DESIGN.

THE COMPANIES USED A QUANTITY TAKE-OFF APPROACH, AND A FEW WERE DEVELOPING PLUG-IN APPROACHES. CHALLENGES INCLUDED THE LACK OF QUALITY IN THE MODELS, THUS MOST COMPANIES SUPPLEMENTED MODEL DATA WITH OTHER DATA SOURCES. FEATURES THEY FOUND VALUABLE FOR BIM-LCA INCLUDED VISUAL INTERFACE, TRANSPARENCY OF DATA, AUTOMATION, DESIGN EVALUATION, AND FLEXIBILITY.

SOME OF THEM WITH AGES OF MORE THAN 100 YEARS, REPRESENT A HISTORICALLY VERY VALUABLE BUILDING FABRIC. IN AUSTRIA'S RAILROAD NETWORK ALONE THERE ARE AROUND 1,000 ARCH BRIDGES STILL IN OPERATION. IN WHOLE EUROPE THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MASONRY RAILROAD BRIDGES AMOUNTS TO 70,000. NOWADAYS INCREASINGLY MORE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING ARCH BRIDGES THAN ON THEIR RECONSTRUCTION, AS A RESULT OF FINANCIAL REASONS AS WELL AS MONUMENT CONSERVATION ASPECTS. SINCE THOSE BRIDGES USUALLY HAVE BEEN PROJECTED FOR VERY DIFFERENT LOADS, ASSESSMENTS CONCERNING THE CURRENT BEARING CAPACITY AND THE FUTURE UTILIZATION ARE REQUIRED. A RECALCULATION WITH CONVENTIONAL CALCULATION METHODS IS OFTEN INSUFFICIENT AS RESULTS CAN CONSIDERABLY DEVIATE FROM THE ACTUAL LOAD CAPACITY DUE TO VARIOUS INFLUENCING FACTORS. THE CHALLENGE THEREFORE IS TO FIND AND VERIFY MORE ACCURATE METHODS TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL CONDITION OF SUCH ARCH BRIDGES. A POINT OF INTEREST IS THE COMBINATION OF FINITE ELEMENT MODELING STRATEGIES OF MASONRY WITH INSPECTION AND MONITORING STRATEGIES OF EXISTING STRUCTURES. INSPECTIONS ENABLE THE DETECTION OF ``DAMAGE'' WHEREBY DAMAGE IS DEFINED AS CHANGES IN MATERIAL AS WELL AS GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF A STRUCTURE. THE APPLICATIONS OF MONITORING SYSTEMS ALLOW A CONTINUOUS OBSERVATION OF A SYSTEM OVER TIME. IN CASE OF LONG TERM OBSERVATIONS, THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROCESS IS A PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING THE ABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE TO PERFORM ITS TASKS. WITHIN THE PROPOSED CONTRIBUTION A GENERALLY VALID METHODOLOGY FOR THE PERFORMANCE AND LIFETIME ASSESSMENT OF MASONRY ARCH BRIDGES BASED ON NONLINEAR FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AND MONITORING DATA WILL BE PRESENTED. FURTHER TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF EXTREME VALUES AND PROBABILITY OF FAILURE WILL BE DISCUSSED.

IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT STUDIES OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM)-BASED CWM FAILED TO ANALYZE THE COST-BENEFITS DUE TO THE LACK OF NUMERICAL ECONOMIC BENCHMARKS. TO ADDRESS THE GAP, THIS STUDY DEVELOPED A SYSTEM DYNAMIC (SD) MODEL TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION (C\&D) WASTE FROM USING BIM. CAUSAL LOOP AND STOCK-FLOW DIAGRAMS ARE MODELED BASED ON THE DETERMINED VARIABLES AND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS. STANDARD SENSITIVITY TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED TO ESTABLISH THE VALIDITY OF THE MODEL UNDER REAL SYSTEM CONDITIONS. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WERE APPLIED TO SIMULATE AND COMPARE THE MODEL RESULTS IN RESPONSE TO VARIOUS POLICIES. A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO QUANTIFY THE COSTS AND THE PROFITS. BASED ON THE COMPARISON WITH THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH AND BIM-BASED METHOD, BIM CAN REDUCE CWM COST BY UP TO 57\%. THE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATED THAT HIGHER LANDFILL CHARGES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOTIVATE MANAGERS TO USE SUSTAINABLE CWM; CONVERSELY, INCREASING THE MODULARITY OF DESIGN AND EARLIER REALIZATION OF NET BENEFITS WILL INCENTIVIZE PROJECT MANAGERS TO EMPLOY BIM-BASED CWM.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","K.

AS INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE AND GIVEN THAT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PRODUCERS OF GHG EMISSIONS, IT IS CRUCIAL TO METICULOUSLY QUANTIFY AND LOWER ITS EMISSIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH PRESENTS A NOVEL FRAMEWORK BY COMBINING ADVANCED TOOLS I.E., BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM), LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GISS), AND QUANTIFICATION OF EMBODIED EMISSIONS TO OPTIMIZE CONSTRUCTION'S DESIGN, MATERIAL-SELECTION, OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE, AND WASTE-MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH THE HELP OF A REAL-WORLD CASE STUDY IN ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN. A BUILDING MODEL HAS BEEN GENERATED USING BIM, AND A COMPREHENSIVE LCA HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. ADDITIONALLY, GIS TOOLS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATIONS AND ACCESSIBILITY OF AVAILABLE-WASTE-MANAGEMENT FACILITIES. BASED ON THIS DATA, EMBODIED EMISSIONS RELATED TO HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION OF WASTE MATERIAL TO DISPOSAL FACILITIES HAVE BEEN COMPUTED USING MATHEMATICAL ANALYSES. FURTHERMORE, TARGETED MITIGATION STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND AN OPTIMIZED ROUTE HAS BEEN DESIGNED USING GIS-BASED ROUTE-OPTIMIZATION TOOLS ALONG THE SUGGESTED FACILITY CENTERS IN THE ISLAMABAD REGION. THE CASE STUDY HAS BEEN REASSESSED WITH ALLEVIATION STRATEGIES, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT 29.35\% OF THE MATERIALIZATION STAGE, 16.04\% OF THE OPERATIONAL STAGE, AND 21.14\% OF THE END-OF-LIFE-PHASE GHG EMISSIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY REDUCED. HENCE, PRE-EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION CAUSED BY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE CYCLE MIGHT OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPREHEND AND REDUCE PROSPECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCES \& TECHNOLOGY - PAKISTAN; INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, PAKISTAN","360","MZUBAIR@KFU.EDU.SA MUBASHIRALIABBASI984@GMAIL.COM ARSALAN.KHAN@IIU.EDU.PK ADILKHANNAREJO@GMAIL.COM USMAN.HASSAN@NICE.NUST.EDU.PK WTANOLI@KFU.EDU.SA",NA,NA,"2024-12-23","10.3390/buildings14020360","JG1A5","2075-5309",NA,NA,"DEANSHIP OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, VICE PRESIDENCY FOR GRADUATE STUDIES AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, KING FAISAL UNIVERSITY, SAUDI ARABIA; [GRANT5606]","THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEANSHIP OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, VICE PRESIDENCY FOR GRADUATE STUDIES AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, KING FAISAL UNIVERSITY, SAUDI ARABIA (PROJECT NO.
