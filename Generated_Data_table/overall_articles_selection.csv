HOWEVER, DESIGNERS ARE FACED WITH MANY DECISIONS DURING THESE STAGES AND TYPICALLY LACK INTUITION ON WHICH DECISIONS ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO A BUILDING'S IMPACT. AS A RESULT, DESIGNERS OFTEN DEFER DECISIONS TO LATER STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CAN BE USED TO ENABLE BETTER EARLY STAGE DECISION-MAKING BY PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) DESIGN CHOICES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD FOR APPLYING LCA TO EARLY STAGE DECISION-MAKING IN ORDER TO INFORM DESIGNERS OF THE RELATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING COMPONENT MATERIAL AND DIMENSIONING CHOICES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO GENERALIZE THE METHOD ACROSS A RANGE OF BUILDING SHAPES AND DESIGN PARAMETERS. AN IMPACT ALLOCATION SCHEME IS DEVELOPED THAT SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF EMBODIED IMPACTS AMONG BUILDING ELEMENTS, AND AN IMPACT REDUCTION SCHEME SHOWS WHICH MATERIAL AND THICKNESS DECISIONS ACHIEVE THE GREATEST EMBODIED IMPACT REDUCTIONS. A MULTI-BUILDING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IS USED AS A CASE STUDY FOR INTRODUCING THE PROPOSED METHOD TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE METHOD CAN ASSIST IN THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS BY HIGHLIGHTING THOSE EARLY STAGE DECISIONS THAT FREQUENTLY ACHIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EMBODIED CARBON FOOTPRINT.

HOWEVER, THE STUDY OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER A BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE BASED ON ECOTECT AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING IN DEVELOPING AREAS OF NANJING HAS YET TO BE CONDUCTED. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS PAPER REPRESENT A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THIS PAPER IS THAT ECOTECT AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING CAN BE HELPFUL IN SIMPLIFYING THE ESTIMATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER A BUILDING'S LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE A MAJORITY OF THE INFORMATION AND CALCULATION TOOLS NECESSARY FOR PERFORMING AN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH MAY ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WHEN EXECUTING AN LCA OF A BUILDING. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY CHANGING SEVERAL PARAMETERS TO IDENTIFY THE PARAMETERS THAT HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACTS ON THE PERFORMANCE A BUILDING. A COMPARISON OF THE LIFE CYCLE CARBON EMISSIONS FOR EACH STAGE SHOWED THAT THE OPERATIONAL STAGE IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO CARBON EMISSIONS. APPROXIMATELY 85.4\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS WERE GENERATED DURING OPERATION. THE CONSTRUCTION STAGE ACCOUNTED FOR 12.6\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS. APPROXIMATELY 2\% OF THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS OCCURRED DURING THE DEMOLITION STAGE. COMPARED TO THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE BUILDING, CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY VEGETATION WAS MINIMAL. THUS, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN ACHIEVE THE GREATEST REDUCTIONS IN CARBON EMISSIONS BY TARGETING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDRESSING NON-OPERATIONAL PHASES SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED BECAUSE THE AVERAGE CARBON EMISSIONS PER WORKING AREA PER YEAR OF NON-OPERATIONAL STAGES ARE FAR GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE USE PHASE.

PREVIOUS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE USE PHASE OF A BUILDING IS DOMINANT IN MOST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES. DUE TO THE LONG LIFE SPAN OF BUILDINGS AND POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN USAGE PATTERNS OVER TIME, A SHIFT TOWARD DLCA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. WE DEFINE DLCA AS AN APPROACH TO LCA WHICH EXPLICITLY INCORPORATES DYNAMIC PROCESS MODELING IN THE CONTEXT OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS. A SIMPLIFIED MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS USED TO INCORPORATE DYNAMIC INFORMATION FROM THE CASE STUDY BUILDING, TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT SOURCES OF LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATA AND TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS, WHERE AVAILABLE. THE DLCA MODEL WAS EVALUATED FOR THE HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF AN EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING, WITH ADDITIONAL SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT FOR SENSITIVITY AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF FUTURE IMPACTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT OVERALL LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS VARIED GREATLY IN SOME CATEGORIES WHEN COMPARED TO STATIC LCA RESULTS, GENERATED FROM THE TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE OF EITHER THE BUILDING'S INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OR ITS RECENT RENOVATION. FROM THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION PERSPECTIVE, IMPACTS IN CATEGORIES RELATED TO CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS WERE REDUCED BY MORE THAN 50 \% WHEN COMPARED TO A STATIC LCA, EVEN THOUGH NONRENEWABLE ENERGY USE INCREASED BY 15 \%. POLLUTION CONTROLS WERE A MAJOR REASON FOR THESE REDUCTIONS. IN THE FUTURE SCENARIO ANALYSIS, THE BASELINE DLCA SCENARIO SHOWED A DECREASE IN ALL IMPACT CATEGORIES COMPARED WITH THE STATIC LCA. THE OUTER BOUNDS OF THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS VARIED FROM SLIGHTLY HIGHER TO STRONGLY LOWER THAN THE STATIC RESULTS, INDICATING THE GENERAL ROBUSTNESS OF THE DECLINE ACROSS THE SCENARIOS. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE USE OF DYNAMIC MODELING IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO INCREASE THE RELEVANCE OF RESULTS. IN SOME CASES, DECISION MAKING RELATED TO BUILDING DESIGN AND OPERATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY CONSIDERING THE INTERACTION OF TEMPORALLY EXPLICIT INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE STEPS OF THE LCA. THE DLCA RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IN SOME CASES, CHANGES DURING A BUILDING'S LIFETIME CAN INFLUENCE THE LCA RESULTS TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN THE MATERIAL AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. ADAPTING LCA TO A MORE DYNAMIC APPROACH MAY INCREASE THE USEFULNESS OF THE METHOD IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS AND OTHER COMPLEX SYSTEMS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY; ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH",NA,"MBILEC@PITT.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-012-0528-2","089HC","1614-7502",NA,NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER EFRI-SEED GRANT [1038139]; MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH; EPA STAR GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP [FP917321]; DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING; EMERGING FRONTIERS \& MULTIDISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES [1038139] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; EPA [673112, FP917321] FUNDING SOURCE: FEDERAL REPORTER","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION UNDER EFRI-SEED GRANT \#1038139 AND THE MASCARO CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AND BY EPA STAR GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP FP917321.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH TO EXAMINE CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION IN PREFABRICATION BY USING THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS, E.G., BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM), EMERGING FROM THE TECHNOLOGY SPHERE. AS A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF A FACILITY, BIM PROVIDES A CYBER PLATFORM BASED ON WHICH MANY ASSESSMENT AND SIMULATION WORKS CAN BE PERFORMED WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSTRUCT THE PHYSICAL FACILITY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A BIM-BASED APPROACH TO MEASURING CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DURING THE MATERIALIZATION STAGE OF A PREFABRICATED BUILDING PROJECT. FINDINGS FROM THE STUDY INDICATE THAT BIM IS AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS AND THAT PREFABRICATION REDUCES CARBON EMISSIONS WHEN COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION METHODS.

THE INTEGRATION OF BIM AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE TIME FOR LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THE LCA RESULTS FOR THE SPECIFIC BUILDING DESIGN. THE LATTER MERIT IS NOT TRIVIAL. FOR INSTANCE, DUE TO TIME LIMIT, MOST BUILDING LCA STUDIES ESTIMATE THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND FUELS CONSUMED IN CONSTRUCTION PHASE QUITE ROUGHLY, WHICH EXCLUDES THE CHOICES ON A WIDE RANGE OF CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES, MATERIALS, SPECIALTIES AND MACHINES, NO NEED TO MENTION THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN OPERATION PHASE, WHICH IS USUALLY ESTIMATED IN AN EVEN BOLDER MANNER. THE ROUGHNESS OF THE LCA PRACTICE UNDERMINES ITS CREDIBILITY AND HINDERS ITS APPLICATION AS A DECISION SUPPORTING TOOL FOR LOW CARBON DESIGN. CURRENTLY, CHINA'S ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) SECTOR IS UNDERGOING A SMART TRANSFORMATION, STEERED BY THE INCREASED USE OF BIM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A BIM-ENABLED LCA METHOD AND ILLUSTRATES HOW THE METHOD CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE THE LOW CARBON DESIGN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE SMART AEC TRANSITION IN CHINA. A CASE STUDY ON CARBON FOOTPRINT ACCOUNTING FOR A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS CONDUCTED. IN THIS STUDY, VARIOUS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND DATA SOURCES ARE COMBINED TO ENHANCE THE DATA FLOW AND INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN BIM MODELS AND LCA MODELS. BIM TOOLS ARE USED TO CREATE THE BIM MODEL, CALCULATE THE INPUTS (MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION MACHINES, ENERGIES, WATER AND SO ON) OF ON-SITE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND SIMULATE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BUILDING OPERATION. THE EBALANCE, A CHINA'S LOCAL LCA SOFTWARE TOOL IS APPLIED TO BUILD THE LCA MODEL. THE CHINESE LIFE CYCLE DATABASE IS USED AS THE MAIN DATA SOURCE (72.73\%) TO CALCULATE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE GIVEN BUILDING WHILE THE ECOINVENT DATABASE AND EUROPEAN LIFE CYCLE DATABASE ACT AS SUPPLEMENTARY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING IS 2993 KG CO(2)EQ/M(2). THE OPERATION PHASE CONTRIBUTES TO 69\% OF THE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSION, WHILE THE BUILDING MATERIAL PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTES TO 24\%. CONCRETE IS THE MOST USED BUILDING MATERIAL, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 82\% OF MASS BUT CONTRIBUTES TO ONLY 44\% OF THE MATERIAL RELATED GHG EMISSION. ALTHOUGH STEEL AND ALUMINUM ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 2.6\% AND 1.4\% OF MASS, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO 28\% AND 17\% GHG EMISSION, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGH BIM-ENABLE LCA MODELING, THE POTENTIAL LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUILDINGS CAN BE ASSESSED IN DETAIL. THIS MAKES THE LCA NOT ONLY MORE ACCESSIBLE BUT ALSO MORE CREDIBLE FOR THE AEC PROFESSIONALS TO USE IT AS A GUIDE FOR THE LOW CARBON DESIGN OF BUILDINGS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD.

ESPECIALLY, THE TREATMENT OF WASTE (I.E. DEMOLITION, COLLECTION, SORTING, TRANSPORTATION, RECYCLING AND LANDFILL) HAS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS, E.G. CARBON EMISSIONS DUE TO ENERGY CONSUMED BY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE WASTE TREATMENT METHODS WITH LOW CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES PREDOMINATELY FOCUSED ON QUANTIFYING THE CARBON EMISSION OF BUILDINGS. IN CONTRAST, THE CARBON EMISSION DERIVED FROM THE TREATMENT OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE IS LARGELY OVERLOOKED. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY TO FACILITATE THE ASSESSMENT OF CARBON EMISSIONS OVER THE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE. IN THIS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO HARVEST DATA AND FEED INTO THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT. CASE STUDY OF A HIGH-RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WAS CONDUCTED TO SHOWCASE HOW THIS FRAMEWORK CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT DERIVED FROM RECYCLING OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE VARIES FROM ONE MATERIAL TO ANOTHER. THE RECYCLING OF METAL WASTE HAS FAR HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS COMPARED TO MASONRY WASTES. IN PARTICULAR, ALUMINUM COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AS HIGH AS 45\% OF CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION DESPITE ONLY ACCOUNTING FOR 0.66\% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT. ACROSS VARIOUS LIFECYCLE STAGES, THE ONSITE COLLECTION AND SORTING IS THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE TOTAL CARBON EMISSION. IN ADDITION, ON-SITE RECYCLING HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO FACTORY RECYCLING AND LANDFILL IN TERMS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. FURTHERMORE, A LARGE SCALE INVENTORIES ARE DEVELOPED AS AN OUTCOME OF THIS CASE STUDY. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE USEFUL INPUTS TO THE FUTURE ENDEAVOR OF BUILDING DEMOLITION WASTE RECYCLING IN A BID TO REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED CARBON EMISSIONS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE ACTUAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS COULD BE AS MUCH AS 2.5 TIMES OF THE PREDICTED OR SIMULATED. THIS LARGE BUILDING ENERGY PERFORMANCE GAP (BEPG) BETWEEN THE PREDICTED AND ACTUAL CONSUMPTION HAS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR BUILDING ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT AND THEREFORE HAVE ATTRACTED INCREASING ATTENTION FROM RESEARCHERS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE RESEARCHES HAVE RESULTED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE. HOWEVER, RESEARCH HAS NOT REACHED THE PHASE WHERE THE ROOT CAUSES OF BEPG COULD BE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED, MANAGED, AND ELIMINATED. THERE REMAINS A LACK OF SYSTEMATIC AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY, AND SET DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. TO FILL THIS GAP, IN THIS PAPER, A THOROUGH SURVEY AND REVIEW OF BEPG RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT. THE PAPER COLLECTED AND ANALYZED 227 RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS AND DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING PREVIOUS BEPG RESEARCH. SUBSEQUENTLY, AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF BEPG RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE ITS CAUSES AND CORRESPONDING STRATEGIES (INCLUDING DESIGN CONCEPT, ``HARD'' TECHNOLOGIES AND ``SOFT'' MEASURES).

DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF RAILWAY TURNOUTS, THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MAINTENANCE CAN BE IMPROVED BY INTEGRATING EXISTING PRACTICE BY BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM). THIS RESEARCH ESTABLISHES AND ANALYSES THE WORLD'S FIRST 6D BIM FOR LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT OF A RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM. THE BIM (LEVEL 3) HAS INTEGRATED 6-DIMENSIONS OF FIELD DATA INFORMATION BASED ON REVIT-2018 AND NAVISWORKS-2018 PLATFORMS. THE DIGITAL TWINS OF A RAILWAY TURNOUT IN 3D EMBRACE TIME SCHEDULE, COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE. THE USE OF BIM FOR RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEMS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL INFORMATION FLOW OF THE TURNOUT PLANNING AND DESIGN, MANUFACTURING PRE-ASSEMBLY AND LOGISTIC, CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT AND DEMOLITION, THEREBY ACHIEVING BETTER PROJECT PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY. BASED ON INTEGRATED INFORMATION OF RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM, THE 6D BIM HAS THE ABILITY TO ASSESS ON ECONOMIC, MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY, AND ACHIEVE A BALANCE AMONG THEM. THIS IS THE WORD FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BIM CAN FULLY DELIVER ITS ESSENTIAL BENEFITS BY INFORMATION SHARING, EASING TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION, IMPROVING DESIGN QUALITY, REDUCING OF DESIGN ERRORS, ACCELERATING IMPLEMENTATION, SPEEDING UP WORK, SHORTENING CONSTRUCTION DURATION, REDUCING CONSTRUCTION COSTS, ENHANCING CARBON EFFICIENCY, SUPPORTING PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AND PROVIDING ITS OWNERS WITH HIGHER OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OVER THE RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM LIFE-CYCLE.

AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ENERGY DEMAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING STOCKS AT LARGE SPATIAL SCALES IS INCREASINGLY NEEDED FOR DECISION SUPPORT IN SUSTAINABLE PLANNING AND POLICY MAKING. WHILE CURRENT BOTTOM-UP BUILDING STOCK MODELS MAINLY FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE, A NEW RESEARCH TREND HAS INTRODUCED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) FOR A MORE HOLISTIC ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT INCLUDING SEVERAL STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS A SET OF SELECTED BOTTOM-UP LCA STUDIES EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDING STOCKS AT SEVERAL SCALES, FROM URBAN TO TRANSNATIONAL. THE SELECTED STUDIES WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THREE COMMON ELEMENTS: BUILDING STOCK AGGREGATION MODEL, ENERGY ANALYSIS AND LCA. TWO MAIN STOCK AGGREGATION APPROACHES, ARCHETYPES AND BUILDING-BY-BUILDING, ARE APPLIED TO MODEL INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS AND EXTRAPOLATE RESULTS AT THE STOCK LEVEL. BOTTOM-UP ENERGY MODELS, EITHER STATISTICAL OR ENGINEERING-BASED, PROVIDE ENERGY PROFILES FOR THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF BUILDINGS. LCA IS SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND SUPPORT POLICY DECISIONS. CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LCA OF LARGE BUILDING STOCKS ARE FINALLY ADDRESSED AND DISCUSSED TO SUPPORT FUTURE WORKS. BUILDING STOCK AGGREGATION MODELS MAY BE ENHANCED BY ADDRESSING MODEL CALIBRATION, INTEGRATION WITH GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) AND STOCK DYNAMICS MODELS. UNCERTAINTY PROPAGATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND MODEL SIMPLIFICATION ARE RECOMMENDED FOR ENERGY MODELS AND LCA TO BRIDGE DATA GAPS AND REDUCE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE MODELS.

THROUGH THE DEVELOPED OPTIMIZATION MODEL, THE EXAMINATION OF VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR BUILDING COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE ENVELOPE OF A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS UNDERTAKEN. INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL COMPONENTS OF BUILDING ENVELOPES INFLUENCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS, PARTICULARLY, EXTERIOR WALLS AND WINDOWS.

HOWEVER, MANY PPPS IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH CONTROVERSY AS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT COST AND SCHEDULE OVERRUNS DURING CONSTRUCTION. CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF PPP PROJECTS IS EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT/EVALUATION. YET, CONVENTIONAL EX-POST EVALUATION THAT SOLELY FOCUSES ON MEETING BUDGET AND A PREDETERMINED SCHEDULE ARE INVARIABLY APPLIED TO MEASURE PPPS IN PRACTICE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT LITERATURE USED TO EVALUATE PPP PROJECTS AND PROPOSES THAT A LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH TO THEIR EVALUATION IS NEEDED TO `FUTURE PROOF' THEIR PERFORMANCE AND ENSURE VALUE FOR MONEY THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF PPPS IS TO MAXIMISE PROFITABILITY, THERE IS A NEED TO AMELIORATE THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE, END-USERS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THIS CAN BE ENABLED THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AS IT NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ASSET, BUT ALSO PROVIDES KEY DECISION MAKERS WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ACROSS A PROJECT'S LIFE-CYCLE. WHEN ALIGNED WITH A SERIES OF CORE INDICATORS THAT ARE USED FOR PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT BIM CAN ACT AS A CATALYST FOR `FUTURE PROOFING' PPPS AND ENABLE THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF AN ASSET THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE-CYCLE.

DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE, THERE ARE NO EMISSIONS AND THE ONLY INPUT IS REPRESENTED BY SOLAR POWER. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, CONSIDERING THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF A PLANT, PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS, LIKE ANY OTHER MEANS OF ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION, GIVE RISE TO EMISSIONS, THAT FOCUS ESPECIALLY IN THE MANUFACTURING STAGE AND INSTALLATION OF COMPONENTS. THE PRESENT WORK AIMS AT EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, AND THEREFORE THE ACTUAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, EXAMINING A GROUND-MOUNTED 1778.48 KW(P) PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANT, REALIZED BY TERNIENERGIA S.P.A. AND LOCATED IN MARSCIANO (PERUGIA, ITALY). THE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED USING THE METHODOLOGY OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH ALLOWS TO CONSIDER ALL STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE, FROM THE EXTRACTION OF RAW MATERIALS TO THE PLANT'S DISPOSAL (''FROM A CRADLE TO GRAVE PERSPECTIVE''). IN PARTICULAR, THE STUDY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SOIL PREPARATION, THE INSTALLATION OF FENCE AND ELECTRICAL SUBSTATIONS OF LOW AND MEDIUM VOLTAGE, THE MOUNTING OF SUPPORT STRUCTURES, ALSO WITH REFERENCE TO HOT DIP GALVANIZING PROCESS, THE PRODUCTION OF MODULES, THEIR INSTALLATION, THE WIRING APPARATUS AND THE NETWORK CONNECTION. THE TRANSPORT OF ALL COMPONENTS TO THE INSTALLATION SITE IS CONSIDERED FOR EACH STAGE THAT IS EXAMINED. THE END OF LIFE SCENARIO OF THE PLANT IS ALSO EVALUATED. THE POSSIBILITY TO COLLECT MANY DETAILED INFORMATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION SITE, DURING THE BUILDING PHASE, ADDS VALUE TO THE STUDY. THE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO UNI EN ISO 14040 AND UNI EN ISO 14044, WHICH REGULATE THE LCA PROCEDURE. THE LCA MODELLING WAS PERFORMED USING SIMAPRO SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND USING ECO INDICATOR 99 METHODOLOGY. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ALLOWS TO CALCULATE SOME IMPORTANT PARAMETERS LIKE EPBT (ENERGY PAY-BACK TIME), EROEI (ENERGY RETURN ON ENERGY INVESTED), CO2 EMISSIONS AND GWP100 (GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL).

CONSEQUENTLY, A VARIETY OF LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS BASED ON DIFFERENT CONCEPTS ARE AVAILABLE. THE LIFE CYCLE INITIATIVE, HOSTED BY THE UN ENVIRONMENT, ESTABLISHED AN EXPERT TASK FORCE ON ``MINERAL RESOURCES'' TO REVIEW EXISTING METHODS (THIS ARTICLE) AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR APPLICATION-DEPENDENT USE OF THE METHODS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (BERGER ET AL. IN INT J LIFE CYCLE ASSESS, 2020). METHODS STARTING IN 2017, THE TASK FORCE DEVELOPED A WHITE PAPER, WHICH SERVED AS ITS MAIN INPUT TO A SETAC PELLSTON WORKSHOP (R) IN JUNE 2018, IN WHICH A SUB-GROUP OF THE TASK FORCE MEMBERS DEVELOPED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASSESSING IMPACTS OF MINERAL RESOURCE USE IN LCA. THIS ARTICLE, BASED MAINLY ON THE WHITE PAPER AND PRE-WORKSHOP DISCUSSIONS, PRESENTS A THOROUGH REVIEW OF 27 DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS FOR MINERAL RESOURCE USE IN THE ``NATURAL RESOURCES'' AREA OF PROTECTION. THE METHODS ARE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THEIR BASIC IMPACT MECHANISMS, DESCRIBED AND COMPARED, AND ASSESSED AGAINST A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CRITERIA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION FOUR METHOD CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THEIR UNDERLYING CONCEPTS ARE DESCRIBED BASED ON EXISTING LITERATURE: DEPLETION METHODS, FUTURE EFFORTS METHODS, THERMODYNAMIC ACCOUNTING METHODS, AND SUPPLY RISK METHODS. WHILE WE CONSIDER DEPLETION AND FUTURE EFFORTS METHODS MORE ``TRADITIONAL'' LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS, THERMODYNAMIC ACCOUNTING AND SUPPLY RISK METHODS ARE RATHER PROVIDING COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. WITHIN EACH METHOD CATEGORY, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN METHODS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, WHICH ALLOWS FOR FURTHER SUB-CATEGORIZATION AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE METHODS ACTUALLY ASSESS. CONCLUSIONS WE PROVIDE A THOROUGH REVIEW OF EXISTING LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS ADDRESSING IMPACTS OF MINERAL RESOURCE USE, COVERING A BROAD OVERVIEW OF BASIC IMPACT MECHANISMS TO A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF METHOD-SPECIFIC MODELING. THIS SUPPORTS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE METHODS ACTUALLY ASSESS AND HIGHLIGHTS THEIR STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. BUILDING ON THESE INSIGHTS, BERGER ET AL.

NEVERTHELESS, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE, A BALANCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRITERIA HAS TO BE CREATED. THERE ARE ALREADY DIFFERENT TOOLS AVAILABLE WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REACH THIS GOAL. IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THEM AS SUCH AND FIND OUT HOW THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED TO OBTAIN SYNERGIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION. THESE TOOLS HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN EARLY DESIGN PHASES SO AS TO ADD VALUE TO THE PROJECT. IN THE PRESENT PAPER, TWO POWERFUL METHODS, NAMELY BIM AND LCA, WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED. SUCH METHODS CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY. ON THE ONE HAND, BIM SUPPORTS INTEGRATED DESIGN AND IMPROVES INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT PROJECT LIFE-CYCLE PHASES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LCA IS A SUITABLE METHOD FOR ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. BOTH LCA AND BIM SHOULD BE INTEGRATED IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AT AN EARLY STAGE WITH A VIEW TO ACHIEVING A HOLISTIC OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA, FROM THE BEGINNING.

REDUCING THE WHOLE-LIFE IMPACTS OF BUILDINGS IS CRITICAL FOR CREATING A NET-ZERO CARBON BUILT ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS TO BE ACHIEVED, THE WHOLE-LIFE CARBON IMPACTS OF DESIGN DECISIONS MUST BE CONSIDERED DURING THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS HOW LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IS INCORPORATED AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE BUILDING DESIGN PROCESS, AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT NET-ZERO CARBON DESIGN. THE REVIEW COMPILED 274 PAPERS THAT WERE PUBLISHED UP TO THE END OF 2019, OF WHICH 108 WERE SUBJECT TO DETAILED REVIEW FOLLOWING SCREENING. THE REVIEW FOUND THAT LCA IS GENERALLY USED LATE IN THE DESIGN PROCESS, WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO GREATLY INFLUENCE THE DESIGN. INCORPORATING LCA WITH EITHER BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING OR LIFE CYCLE COSTING IS SEEN TO HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES AS UNDERTAKING A TRADITIONAL LCA. PARAMETRIC METHODS SHOW PROMISE FOR DESIGN DEVELOPMENT, BUT TOOLS AND ALGORITHMS REQUIRE FURTHER VERIFICATION AND REGIONALISATION TO BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY. THE USE OF BENCHMARKS, TARGET VALUES AND OTHER PRE-POPULATED INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO INCORPORATE LIFE-CYCLE THINKING WITHOUT THE NEED TO UNDERTAKE A DETAILED LCA. THE REVIEW HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT LCA CONTINUES TO FACE BARRIERS, IN BOTH METHODS AND PRACTICE, PREVENTING ITS ABILITY TO GUIDE EARLY-STAGE DESIGN DECISIONS AND HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF BATH","107274","MAR90@BATH.AC.UK",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107274","OD5RQ","1873-684X",NA,NA,"LEVERAGED UNIVERSITY RESEARCH STUDENTSHIP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH; UK ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL [EP/S016627/1]; ACTIVE BUILDING CENTRE [EP/5016627/1]; ISCF [EP/V012053/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A LEVERAGED UNIVERSITY RESEARCH STUDENTSHIP, PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH, TO FUND THE DOCTORAL RESEARCH OF MATTHEW ROBERTS.

IN THE LIGHT OF THIS SCENARIO, A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS PERFORMED CONSIDERING SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS, INTEROPERABILITY CONCERNS AND LIFECYCLE STAGES. THIS REVIEW WAS BASED ON EXISTING METHODS COMPLEMENTED BY A MULTICRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS METHOD TO AID THE SELECTION OF RELEVANT PAPERS. ALSO, A QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONS OF THE FIELDS STUDIED.

BIM-BASED EOL IS SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK. THE EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE BASED ON LOCAL WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND CASE-SPECIFIC SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA SELECTION. ANOTHER DRAWBACK OF THESE AD HOC BUT WELL-DEVELOPED BIM-BASED EOL PROTOTYPES IS THEIR USE OF SPECIFIC PROPRIETARY BIM TOOLS TO SUPPORT THEIR FRAMEWORK. THIS DISCONNECTION BETWEEN BIM TOOLS AND EOL TOOLS IS REPORTEDLY HINDERING THE BIM-BASED EOL, WHILE NO IFC CLASSES SUPPORT THE EOL PHASE INFORMATION EXCHANGE.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG; UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG","2670","ARGHAVAN.AKBARIEH@UNI.LU BHAGYA.JAYASINGHE@UNI.LU DANIELE.WALDMANN@UNI.LU NORMAN.TEFERLE@UNI.LU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.3390/su12072670","LL4WR","2071-1050",NA,NA,"INVESTISSEMENT POUR LA CROISSANCE ET L'EMPLOI-EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND (2014-2020) [2017-02-015-15]","THIS RESEARCH IS A PART OF THE ECON4SD (ECO-CONSTRUCTION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT) PROJECT THAT HAS RECEIVED FUNDING FROM INVESTISSEMENT POUR LA CROISSANCE ET L'EMPLOI-EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND (2014-2020), WITH GRANT AGREEMENT 2017-02-015-15.",NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","APR",NA,"102","7","GREEN SUBMITTED, GOLD","WALDMANN, DANIELE/0000-0002-8345-0474 TEFERLE, FELICIA NORMA/0000-0002-9132-3571 JAYASINGHE, BHAGYA/0000-0003-3705-0653 AKBARIEH, ARGHAVAN/0000-0001-6422-6779",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","AKBARIEH, ARGHAVAN/GWB-9716-2022 TEFERLE, FELICIA/AFL-9981-2022 WALDMANN, DANIÈLE/GRE-8140-2022 WALDMANN, DANIELE/E-4016-2017 ",NA,72,"BIM-BASED END-OF-LIFECYCLE DECISION MAKING AND DIGITAL DECONSTRUCTION: LITERATURE REVIEW","REVIEW","WOS000531558100095","15","180","12","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2020,"AKBARIEH ARGHAVAN;JAYASINGHE LADDU BHAGYA;WALDMANN DANIELE;TEFERLE FELIX NORMAN","TEFERLE, FN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LUXEMBOURG, FAC SCI TECHNOL \& MED, CAMPUS KIRCHBERG, L-1359 LUXEMBOURG, LUXEMBOURG","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","none","UNIV LUXEMBOURG;UNIV LUXEMBOURG;UNIV LUXEMBOURG","UNIV LUXEMBOURG",NA,"AKBARIEH A, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY","AKBARIEH A, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA

BUILDINGS DETERIORATE WITH AGE, WHICH LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THEIR ENERGY PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO IMPROVE THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF AGING BUILDING BLOCK ALTHOUGH IT IS CHALLENGING. THE TWO MAIN DECISION PATHS FOR MUNICIPALITIES ARE RENOVATION AND RECONSTRUCTION. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ABOVE OPTIONS FOR THE OLDER HOUSING STOCK IN A DENSELY POPULATED URBAN CENTRE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. A SCENARIO-BASED ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS TAKEN TO EVALUATE THE LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF SIX DIFFERENT RENOVATION AND RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS. THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS WERE CALCULATED FOR EACH SCENARIO INCLUDING THE EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL EMISSION, AND THE EMISSIONS FROM BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. A BIM-LCA COMBINED APPROACH WAS USED TO ASSESS THE EMBODIED GHG EMISSIONS WITH THE SIMAPRO SOFTWARE. HOT2000 SOFTWARE WAS USED TO MODEL THE OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS, AROUND 40\% OF THE EMISSIONS ARE FROM THE MATERIAL MANUFACTURING STAGE. THE EMBODIED EMISSIONS GENERATED FROM THE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIOS ARE 5-6 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RENOVATION SCENARIOS. THE LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF THE EXISTING HOUSE CAN BE REDUCED BY APPLYING RENOVATIONS, WITH THE EMISSIONS SAVING GRADUALLY INCREASING WITH THE LEVEL OF RETROFITTING. THE PASSIVE HOUSE RECONSTRUCTION SCENARIO DELIVERS THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS REDUCTION COMPARED TO ALL OTHER SCENARIOS. IN TERMS OF THE GHG EMISSION INTENSITY PER UNIT AREA, THE NEWLY-BUILT HOUSES IN SCENARIOS 5 AND 6 ALSO HAVE LOWER LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSION PER SQUARE METER THAN THE RENOVATED EXISTING HOUSES IN SCENARIO 1-4 AFTER 15 AND 10 YEARS TO BREAKEVEN RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THIS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE OLDER EXISTING BUILDING STOCK, A CAREFUL WEIGHING OF OPTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION ON REPLACING THEM WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS TO RENOVATE OR REPLACE EXISTING HOUSES. THE STUDY OUTCOMES WILL SUPPORT CITY PLANNERS AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PLANNERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON BC AGING BUILDING STOCK DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH POPULATION DENSITY NEIGHBOURHOODS.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A HOLISTIC LIFE-CYCLE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM BASED ON BIM TECHNOLOGY TO CALCULATE CARBON EMISSIONS OF PCB ACCURATELY AND EFFICIENTLY, AND VERIFY THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY SAVING AND EMISSION REDUCTION. EXISTING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL DATABANKS ALLOWED THE COMPILATION OF CARBON EMISSION FACTORS. FIVE REPRESENTATIVE RESIDENTIAL PCB PROJECTS WERE ENLISTED TO CALCULATE CARBON FOOTPRINTS IN SIX INDIVIDUAL LIFE-CYCLE CONSTRUCTION STAGES. IN MOST STAGES, CARBON EMISSIONS WERE REDUCED WITH AN INCREASING PREFABRICATION RATE. IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE STAGE, CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 91\% OF THE TOTAL, AND THE BUILDING MATERIALS PRODUCTION STAGE ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 11\%. THE ``NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSION `` IN THE DEMOLITION AND RECYCLING STAGE WAS ABOUT-4\%. CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE REMAINING THREE STAGES WERE MINIMAL AT ABOUT < 2\%. THIS STUDY ESTABLISHED THE WHOLE LIFE-CYCLE CARBON-EMISSION INDICES OF RESIDENTIAL PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION PER UNIT AREA AT AROUND 105.88 KGCO(2)/(M(2).A), AND COMPUTED VALUES FOR INDIVIDUAL BUILDING STAGES. FOR COMPARISON, A COMPLETELY CAST-IN-PLACE BUILDING WAS STUDIED, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL CARBON EMISSION PER UNIT AREA AT AROUND 130.79 KGCO(2)/(M(2).A), SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PCB. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTED TO KNOWLEDGE BY FURNISHING THE HOLISTIC CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATION METHOD AND ESTABLISHING THE EMPIRICAL PATTERNS AND TRENDS OF CARBON EMISSIONS OF PCB.

IN RECENT YEARS, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED RAPIDLY TO PROVIDE A FASTER SOLUTION TO GENERATE AND PROCESS THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION IN A SHARED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT AN INNOVATIVE 6D BIM APPROACH FOR THE LIFECYCLE ASSET MANAGEMENT OF A BRIDGE INFRASTRUCTURE BY USING DONGGOU BRIDGE AS A CASE STUDY. THIS PAPER ADOPTS 6D MODELLING, INCORPORATING 3D MODEL INFORMATION WITH TIME SCHEDULE, COST ESTIMATION, AND CARBON FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS ACROSS THE LIFECYCLE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT. THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER REVEAL THAT RAW MATERIALS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS, AND AS THE 6D BIM MODEL WAS DEVELOPED IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE LIFECYCLE, STAKEHOLDERS CAN COLLABORATE WITHIN THE BIM ENVIRONMENT TO ENHANCE A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE OUTCOME IN ADVANCE. THIS STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBILITY OF BIM APPLICATIONS TO BRIDGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LIFECYCLE. THE 6D BIM CAN SAVE TIME BY TRANSFORMING 2D INFORMATION TO 3D INFORMATION AND REDUCING ERRORS DURING THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION STAGES THROUGH BETTER VISUALISATION FOR STAFF TRAINING. MOREOVER, 6D BIM CAN PROMOTE EFFICIENT ASSET AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT SINCE IT CAN BE APPLIED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES SIMULTANEOUSLY, SUCH AS SUSTAINABILITY, LIFECYCLE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE, CONDITION MONITORING AND REAL-TIME STRUCTURAL SIMULATIONS. IN ADDITION, BIM CAN PROMOTE COOPERATION AMONG WORKING PARTIES AND IMPROVE VISUALISATION OF THE PROJECT FOR VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM","2436","S.KAEWUNRUEN@BHAM.AC.UK JSS814@STUDENT.BHAM.AC.UK ZXZ884@STUDENT.BHAM.AC.UK",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.3390/su12062436","LA1YW","2071-1050",NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION [691135]; UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM'S OPEN ACCESS FUND","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE FINANCIAL SPONSORSHIP OF THE H2020-MSCA-RISE PROJECT NO. 691135 ``RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING NETWORK (RISEN)'' WHICH ENABLES A GLOBAL RESEARCH NETWORK THAT TACKLES THE GRAND CHALLENGE IN RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE AND ADVANCED SENSING.

THE PAPER ADDRESSES THIS COMMON LIMITATION OFFERING AN INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AT BUILDING LEVEL. TO ACHIEVE THIS, A BIM-EMBEDDED APPROACH WAS ESTABLISHED UTILISING EMBODIED CARBON METRICS AND RESULTS FROM HEURISTIC STRUCTURAL OPTIMISATION. A REAL BUILDING SCENARIO WAS USED TO TEST THE PROPOSED APPROACH IN THE CONTEXT OF MULTI-STOREY REINFORCED CONCRETE (RC) BUILDINGS. RESULTS SHOW HOW THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE IS AFFECTED BY THE USE OF STRUCTURALLY OPTIMISED DESIGNS. THE STRUCTURAL FLOORS IN PARTICULAR, NOT ONLY COVER THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF THE EMBODIED CARBON IN THE STRUCTURE BUT THEY ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE TESTED BUILDING ELEMENTS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS PAPER JUSTIFIED THE NEED FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS IN THE DESIGN OPTIMISATION OF RC FLOORS.

WHILE RAINWATER HARVESTING IS PERCEIVED AS A SUSTAINABLE DESIGN APPROACH, THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. TO ADDRESS THIS LITERATURE GAP, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING TOOLS WERE APPLIED FOR A DORMITORY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY USE HARVESTED RAINWATER TO FLUSH TOILETS OR TO IRRIGATE THE LAWN. FIVE SCENARIOS WERE MODELED INCLUDING A NEW VERSUS RENOVATED BUILDING AND IRRIGATION VERSUS TOILET FLUSHING WATER END USE. THE RAINWATER CISTERNS FOR ALL THE SCENARIOS WERE SIZED USING THE YIELD AFTER SPILLAGE APPROACH AND LONG TERM DAILY PRECIPITATION OF TOLEDO. ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WERE CALCULATED USING ECONOMIC INPUT OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (FOR CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND ENERGY USE BY PUMP) AND GABI (FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT) DATABASES. THE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS WERE ESTIMATED AND COMPARED TO THE BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO, WHERE THE WATER SUPPLY DEMANDS ARE MET BY MUNICIPALLY SUPPLIED POTABLE WATER IN A COMBINED OR SEPARATE SANITARY SEWER NETWORK. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION PAYBACK PERIODS CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR ALMOST EVERY SCENARIO. YET COST PAYBACK PERIODS OF IMPLEMENTING HARVESTED RAINWATER WERE FOUND TO BE LONGER THAN THE LIFE TIME OF THE BUILDING EXCEPT FOR TWO SCENARIOS: USING RAINWATER FOR IRRIGATION IN A RENOVATION PROJECT AND USING RAINWATER FOR TOILET FLUSHING IN A NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THESE TWO SCENARIOS HAD THE LOWEST COST, ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION IMPACTS AMONG ALL SCENARIOS MODELED. REDUCING OCCUPANCY TO MATCH TOILET FLUSHING DEMAND INCREASED THE PER PERSON IMPACT. HOWEVER, IN GENERAL, THE PER PERSON IMPACTS WERE MUCH LOWER THAN A PERSON'S IMPACT FROM DRIVING OR ELECTRICITY USE. WHILE SEPARATE SEWERS DIVERT THE STORMWATER RUNOFF TO THE WATER BODIES AND THEREBY PREVENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS, A RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM CONNECTED TO SEPARATE SEWERS WAS FOUND TO REDUCE THE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LESS THAN SO IF THE RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEM WERE CONNECTED TO COMBINED SEWERS.

MANY GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEMS (GBRSS) USE LCA TO VARIOUS DEGREES. IN THIS PAPER, A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE LCA SOFTWARE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO BUILDING DESIGNERS. A WHOLE-BUILDING LCA WAS PERFORMED FOR A LARGE BUILDING USING THREE SOFTWARE LCA TOOLS. THE SOFTWARE TOOLS VARY IN KEY ASPECTS, SUCH AS INTENDED USERS (E.G., LCA EXPERTS OR NOVICES), DESIGN STAGE IN WHICH THEY CAN BE USED, AND TIME. THE EVALUATED LCA TOOLS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR USE IN EARLY DESIGN AND DECISION MAKING. SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS RELY ON A BILL OF MATERIALS THAT CHANGES CONSTANTLY IN DESIGN ALTERATIONS. HOWEVER, OTHERS SHOWED A GREATER ADVANTAGE IN THAT THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. THE COMPARATIVE LCA RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IMPACT OF LCA SOFTWARE IS DEPENDENT ON THE IMPACT CATEGORY AND THE PRECISION IN THE PROCESS OF MATERIAL QUANTITIES TAKEOFF. THE CASE STUDY WAS INFLUENCED BY THE BUILDING TYPE AND ITS INTENSE OPERATIONAL ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. CONVENTIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING THE LIGHTING EFFICIENCY, FAR EXCEEDED WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MITIGATE THE EMBEDDED IMPACT OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. THUS, ADVANCING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LCA BASELINE BUILDING AND ADDRESSING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK ARE DISCUSSED.

THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY (CE) COULD OFFER AN APPROACH TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. FOR A TRANSITION TOWARDS A CIRCULAR BUILT ENVIRONMENT, A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT METHOD IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCULAR BUILDING PRODUCTS. AS A STEP TOWARDS SUCH A METHOD, WE DEVELOPED AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IN THE FORM OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY LIFE CYCLE COST (CE-LCC) MODEL. IT IS BASED ON EXISTING LIFE CYCLE COST TECHNIQUES AND ADAPTED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF CE PRODUCTS. THE MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO (1) CONSIDER PRODUCTS AS A COMPOSITE OF COMPONENTS AND PARTS WITH DIFFERENT AND MULTIPLE USE CYCLES, (2) INCLUDE PROCESSES THAT TAKE PLACE AFTER THE END OF USE, (3) PROVIDE PRACTICAL AND USABLE INFORMATION TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS, AND (4) FACILITATE ALIGNMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT AND SYSTEM BOUNDARIES WITH LCA. TO TEST THE MODEL, IT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE CASE OF THE CIRCULAR KITCHEN (CIK). THREE VARIANTS OF THE CIK WERE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER AND THE `BUSINESS-AS-USUAL' CASE TO DETERMINE WHICH VARIANT IS THE MOST ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE ON THE LONG TERM. THE MODEL INDICATES THAT THE MOST FLEXIBLE VARIANT OF THE CIK HAS THE LOWEST LCC OUTCOME, EVEN WHEN CONSIDERING MULTIPLE INTEREST, LIFESPAN AND REMANUFACTURING AND RECYCLING SCENARIOS.

METHODS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY CURRENT RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS OF LCA IN BUILDINGS. THE PROPOSED REVIEW METHODOLOGY INCLUDES (I) IDENTIFYING RECENT AUTHORITATIVE RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS USING ESTABLISHED SEARCH ENGINES, (II) SCREENING AND RETAINING RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS, AND (III) EXTRACTING RELEVANT LCA APPLICATIONS FOR BUILDINGS AND ANALYZING THEIR UNDERPINNING RESEARCH. SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL RESEARCH GAPS AND LIMITATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED, WHICH HAVE INFORMED OUR PROPOSED FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT HUMANS CAN ATTENUATE AND POSITIVELY CONTROL THE IMPACT OF THEIR BUILDINGS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, AND AS SUCH MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY A NEW GENERATION OF LCA METHODS AND TOOLS THAT ARE MODEL BASED AND CONTINUOUSLY LEARN FROM REAL-TIME DATA, WHILE INFORMING EFFECTIVE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF BUILDINGS AND DISTRICTS. THEREFORE, THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TIME DIMENSION IN PRODUCT SYSTEM MODELING IS BECOMING ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE RESULTING POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. THIS TIME DIMENSION IS CURRENTLY MISSING IN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATABASES. A FURTHER COMBINATION OF LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) MODELS USING TIME-DEPENDENT CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS CAN LEAD TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE LCA RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THIS PAPER PROMOTES THE CONCEPT OF SEMANTIC-BASED DYNAMIC (REAL-TIME) LCA, WHICH ADDRESSES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN THE LOCAL BUILT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ECOSYSTEM, AND THUS MORE EFFECTIVELY PROMOTES A ``CRADLE-TO-GRAVE-TO-REINCARNATION'' ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY CAPABILITY. FURTHERMORE, IT IS CRITICAL TO LEVERAGE DIGITAL BUILDING RESOURCES (E.G., CONNECTED OBJECTS, SEMANTIC MODELS, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) TO DELIVER ACCURATE AND RELIABLE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY; KING SAUD UNIVERSITY; LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY",NA,"FNAISAS@CARDIFF.AC.UK REZGUIY@CARDIFF.AC.UK PETRII@CARDIFF.AC.UK BEACHTH@CARDIFFAC.UK YEUNGJ@CARDIFF.AC.UK GHOROGHI@CARDIFF.AC.UK SYLVAIN.KUBICKI@LIST.LU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-022-02058-5","1I1OH","1614-7502","MAY 2022",NA,"ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) IN THE UK; FOND NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE (FNR) IN LUXEMBOURG [EP/T019514/1, INTER/UKRI/19/14106247]; EPSRC [EP/T019514/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) IN THE UK AND FOND NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE (FNR) IN LUXEMBOURG FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE RESEARCH UNDER GRANT AGREEMENT (EP/T019514/1; INTER/UKRI/19/14106247).",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK OF CARBON EMISSIONS BASED ON BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), WHICH CONSISTS OF FOUR STEPS: (1) DEFINING THE BOUNDARY OF CARBON EMISSIONS IN A LIFE CYCLE; (2) ESTABLISHING A CARBON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS DATABASE FOR CHINESE BUILDINGS AND ADOPTING REVIT, GTJ2018, AND GREEN BUILDING STUDIO FOR INVENTORY ANALYSIS; (3) CALCULATING CARBON EMISSIONS AT EACH STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE; AND (4) EXPLAINING THE CALCULATION RESULTS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. THE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED IS VALIDATED USING A CASE STUDY OF A HOSPITAL PROJECT, WHICH IS LOCATED IN AREAS IN ANHUI, CHINA WITH A HOT SUMMER AND A COLD WINTER.

AIMING TO INVESTIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY EVALUATES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SHOWING THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN EVALUATING MIDPOINT AND ENDPOINT IMPACT CATEGORIES. THIS STUDY REVIEWS LCA FROM A BUILDING PERSPECTIVE AND EMPOWERS THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE NOVELTY IS TO ESTIMATE THE OPERATING ENERGY PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATE THE ENDPOINT IMPACTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS AT AN EARLY DESIGNING STAGE, CONSIDERING TWO METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION AND STEEL CONSTRUCTION. THIS WORK FOLLOWS THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF LCA BASED ON ISO 14040 AND 14044 GUIDELINES WITHIN THE AVAILABLE DATABASE, USING AUTODESK GREEN BUILDING STUDIO APPLICATION IN AUTODESK REVIT AND OPEN LCA SOFTWARE BASED ON TWO ASSESSMENT METHODS: IMPACT 2002+ AND ILCD 2011.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE USE OF PCMS FOR ENERGY STORAGE AND PROVIDED SOME LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE EMBODIED ENERGY OF THE PCM; HOWEVER, AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT HAS NOT FULLY BEEN ADDRESSED UNTIL NOW IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PREPARATION OF ORGANIC PCMS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCAS) OF TWO ORGANIC, BIOSOURCED PCMS FOR THEIR APPLICATIONS, FOCUSING ON EMBODIED ENERGY AND CO2 EMISSIONS. DODECANOIC ACID PRODUCED FROM PALM KERNEL OIL WAS CONSIDERED AS A PCM FOR USE IN A SOLAR THERMAL WATER HEATING APPLICATION, AND ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE WAS CONSIDERED FOR THERMAL BUFFERING. THE FUNCTIONAL UNITS WERE DEFINED AS 1 T OF DODECANOIC ACID PCM AND 1 KG OF ENCAPSULATED ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PCM, RESPECTIVELY. THE LCA ENCOMPASSES ALL PHASES IN THE PCM PRODUCTION: GROWTH AND HARVESTING OF THE FEEDSTOCKS, EXTRACTION OF THE OIL, TREATMENT OF THE OIL, AND SEPARATION OF SINGULAR COMPONENTS. THE TWO PCMS WERE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THE PAYBACK TIMES FOR THEIR EMBODIED ENERGIES AND EMBODIED CO2 UNDER A MODELED USE PHASE. THE ENERGY PAYBACK TIME FOR DODECANOIC ACID IN A SOLAR THERMAL APPLICATION WAS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN 2 YEARS. ALTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF DODECANOIC ACID IS A NET CO2 EMITTER, USE OF THIS PCM IN A SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM CAN RECOUP THE CO2 OF PRODUCTION IN LESS THAN A YEAR. ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE, CONSIDERED FOR USE IN A THERMAL BUFFERING WALLBOARD PRODUCT, WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST 30 YEARS OF USE BEFORE ITS ENERGY SAVINGS WOULD MATCH ITS EMBODIED ENERGY, MOSTLY DUE TO THE DRYING STEP IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PCM. HOWEVER, ETHYL HEXADECANOATE IS A STRONG SEQUESTER OF CO2 AT 7.6 T PER TON OF ETHYL HEXADECANOATE. DODECANOIC ACID PRODUCED FROM PALM KERNEL OIL FOR USE IN A SOLAR THERMAL HOT WATER SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE A VIABLE PCM. ITS PAYBACK TIME, BOTH FOR ENERGY AND CARBON EMISSIONS, IS UNDER 3 YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE HIGH EMBODIED ENERGY OF ETHYL HEXADECANOATE PRODUCED FROM ALGAE GIVES A PROHIBITIVELY LONG PAYBACK TIME FOR USE IN DOMESTIC THERMAL BUFFERING APPLICATIONS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY; DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY",NA,"MAWHITE@DAL.CA",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-014-0831-1","CA9NA","1614-7502",NA,NA,"NSERC (CANADA); NSERC PGS-M SCHOLARSHIP","THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE SUPPORT OF THIS WORK FROM GRANTS FROM NSERC (CANADA), INCLUDING SCHOLARSHIPS TO J.A.N.

THIS FRAMEWORK AIMS TO (1) INTEGRATE LIFE CYCLE COST, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ANALYSIS (2) IDENTIFY ENERGY-EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES FOR BUILDINGS' ENERGY RETROFIT (3) MAKE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR DECISION-MAKERS AND INVESTORS (4) DISCOVER THE PRIMARY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AGENTS THAT IMPOSE THE MOST ENERGY WASTE ON EXISTING BUILDINGS.

THE BIM ENERGY MODEL COMPARES THE COOLING AND HEATING LOADS OF THE BUILDING'S COMPONENTS BEFORE AND AFTER APPLYING RETROFITTING MEASURES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INEFFICIENT BUILDINGS' ENVELOPES AND EVAPORATIVE COOLERS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION. A DEVELOPED MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION MODEL ESTIMATES THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST OF A BUILDING DURING ITS LIFETIME. MOREOVER, IT PROVIDES AN OPTIMUM ENERGY RETROFITTING SCENARIO THAT LEADS TO REDUCTIONS OF 24\%-58.2\% IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION.

IN THE DESIGN PROCESS OF A BUILDING, THE USE OF A LOWER INITIAL COST INDEX TO SELECT AN OPTION AMONG OTHERS WITH SIMILAR PERFORMANCE MAY NOT LEAD TO AN ECONOMICALLY OPTIMAL ALTERNATIVE DURING THE LIFE CYCLE. HENCE, TODAY, BUILDING DESIGNERS AND INVESTORS REQUIRE A TOOL TO ESTIMATE LIFE CYCLE COST AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGE TO SELECT AN ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT OPTION. RESILIENT SOLUTIONS GENERALLY LEAD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY AND UPFRONT COSTS AND CARRY ADDITIONAL EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AS WELL. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF RESILIENT BUILDINGS USING A SOUND LCC METHODOLOGY IN THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN STAGE. THE RESEARCH AIMS TO INTEGRATE LCC CAPABILITIES DIRECTLY INTO A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) AND INCREASE THE ECONOMICAL RELEVANCE AND SCIENTIFIC ROBUSTNESS OF LCC INDICATORS TOWARDS BETTER LCC COST OPTIMIZATION. THE PLUGIN, WHICH IS DEVELOPED IN THE BIM TOOL IS REPRESENTED TO USE COST AND RESILIENCY FACTORS TO PREDICT THE WHOLE PROCESS COST OF BUILDING PROJECTS TO ASSIST DESIGNERS IN SELECTING A COST-EFFICIENT AND RESILIENT DESIGN OPTION. THE LCC OF A BUILDING INCLUDES ITS INITIAL COST, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COST, OPERATING COST AND SALVAGE VALUE AT THE END OF THE BUILDING'S USEFUL LIFE, AND ALL OF WHICH WERE CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATION. THE EARTHQUAKE EXPECTED FAILURE AND HUMAN FATALITY COST ARE CALCULATED TO CONSIDER THE RESILIENCY INDEX IN BUILDING DESIGN. THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK TO DESIGN A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING IS DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED ON TWO DESIGN OPTIONS. THE APPLICATION OF THE ACTUAL BUILDING PROJECT ILLUSTRATES THAT BY INCREASING THE INITIAL COST IN THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE BY 4.6\%, ITS ANNUAL EXPECTED FAILURE COST IS DECREASED BY 35.4\%, AND ITS TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE COST IS REDUCED BY ALMOST 10.4\% WITHIN THE FIRST 45 YEARS OF OPERATION. THE REDUCTION IN THE COST OF THE BUILDING AND HUMAN FATALITY DUE TO FAILURE DURING AN EARTHQUAKE MEANS THE BUILDING'S RESILIENCE WOULD BE IMPROVED. USING THE DEVELOPED PLUGIN, DESIGNERS COULD ESTIMATE LCC OF THE BUILDINGS AT THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES AND DESIGN MORE RESILIENT BUILDINGS WITH BETTER ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN ITS LIFE CYCLE ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED INDICES.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","IRAN UNIVERSITY SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA; SHARIF UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","103480","FARZAD.JALAEI@NRC-CNRC.GC.CA",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103480","QB1RB","1872-7891","JAN 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0926-5805","AUTOM.

IN THIS STUDY, AN INTERACTIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEM WAS MATHEMATICALLY FORMULATED WITH MULTIDIRECTIONAL ENERGY INTERACTION PARADIGMS, SUCH AS BUILDING-TO-VEHICLE, GRID-TO-BUILDING, BUILDING-TO-GRID, AND GRID-TO-VEHICLE. THE ROLES OF THE V2B INTERACTION LEVELS, GRID FEED-IN SCHEMES, AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN TECHNO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCES WERE QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERISED, FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV), DISCOUNTED PAYBACK TIME (DPT), AND NET DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION. NOVEL ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WERE PROPOSED FOR BATTERY RELATIVE CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE DYNAMIC RENEWABLE-DEMAND SIGNAL AND GRID INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED ON THE RENEWABLE SYSTEM COST, BATTERY COST, INTEREST RATE, AND ESCALATION RATE OF THE ELECTRICITY PRICE. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IGNORANCE OF BATTERY CYCLING AGING RESULTS IN AN OVERESTIMATION ON NPV FROM 2.404 X 10(8) (0.310 X 10(8) US\$) TO 3.005 X 10(8) HK\$ (0.388 X 10(8) US\$).

IN COMPARISON WITH THE GRID FEED-IN TARIFF POLICIES IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LATEST GRID FEED-IN TARIFF IN HONG KONG CAN INCREASE THE NPV FROM -7.633 X 107 (-0.985 X 10(8) US\$) TO 2.303 X 10(8) HK\$ (0.297 X 10(8) US\$) FOR THE POSITIVE BUILDING-VEHICLE SYSTEM.

THE CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS CONSIDERED ARE REINFORCED CONCRETE FRAMING (RC), STRUCTURAL STEEL FRAMING (SS) AND COLD-FORMED STEEL FRAMING (CFS). THE FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT GUIDELINES FOR LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINABILITY AND IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING IN THE DESIGN STAGE. THE SYSTEM BOUNDARY FOR THE STUDY IS FROM CRADLE-TO-GRAVE, INCLUDING ALL COST COMPONENTS FROM CONSTRUCTION STAGE, USE STAGE AND DISPOSAL STAGE IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE RECYCLING/REUSE OPTIONS. THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING, ENERGY SIMULATION MODELING AND END OF LIFE SCENARIOS TO CALCULATE AND COMPARE LIFE CYCLE COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY ADVANTAGES OF CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM ALTERNATIVES. ALL FUTURE COSTS ARE DISCOUNTED TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING THE APPROPRIATE INTEREST RATES. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE INPUT PARAMETERS ARE MODELED USING REALISTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEN USED IN A MONTE CARLO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE INPUT PARAMETERS ON THE RESULT. APPLICATION OF THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM TO A UNIVERSITY BUILDING REVEALED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS. THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST IS NEARLY THE SAME FOR RC FRAMING SYSTEM AND CFS FRAMING SYSTEM, WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST OF SS FRAMING SYSTEM IS 13.4\% MORE. WHEN THE SYSTEM IS CREDITED FOR POSSIBLE REVENUES RESULTING FROM EARLY OPERATION AND RECYCLING/REUSE, THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE COST OF THE RC FRAMING SYSTEM AND THE SS FRAMING SYSTEM BECOME NEARLY THE SAME WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST OF THE CFS FRAMING SYSTEM BECOMES 22\% LESS. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS SHOWS THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE HAS THE MOST EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED MEAN COST FOLLOWED BY THE INFLATION RATE AND THE CONSTRUCTION COST. THE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FOCUSES ON CALCULATING THE LEED POINTS ASSOCIATED WITH MATERIAL RECYCLING/REUSE POTENTIALS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE STUDY TESTS THE SUITABILITY OF AN INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (IO-LCA) APPROACH IN SCREENING LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS IN COMPANIES. IT ESTIMATES THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF THREE PRODUCTS AND ASSESSES THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH APPROACH IN A COMPANY ENVIRONMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS THE MULTIPLE CASE STUDIES EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF AN IO-LCA METHOD IN A COMPANY ENVIRONMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE LIFE CYCLE COST AND IMPACT STUDY OF THREE PRODUCT SYSTEMS (BUILDING VENTILATION SYSTEM, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) NETWORK PRODUCT, AND WELDING MACHINE) IS CONDUCTED AND THE LIFE CYCLE PHASES WITH HIGHEST ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTION ARE DETERMINED. SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RESULTS TO MAJOR CHANGES IN THE STUDIED SYSTEMS. FINALLY, THE USABILITY OF THE IO-LCA APPROACH FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS IN COMPANIES IS ASSESSED BY COLLECTING DATA ON WORKLOAD AND INTERVIEWING THE PARTICIPATING WORKERS AND MANAGERS. RESULTS THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE USE PHASE WITH OPERATING ENERGY WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPORTANT IN ALL EVALUATED ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, ONLY IN ONE CASE (ICT NETWORK PRODUCT) THE USE WAS THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT LIFE CYCLE PHASE. IN TWO OTHER CASES, THE SOURCING WAS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH IS MUCH EASIER TO ADAPT BY CURRENT MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY LINKS LIFE CYCLE COSTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND, BY ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, REDUCES THE WORKLOAD IN COMPANIES. DISCUSSION IT APPEARS THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH CAN BE USED TO SCREEN ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT LIFE CYCLE PHASES OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS IN COMPANIES BY UTILIZING READILY AVAILABLE ACCOUNTING OR OTHER DOCUMENTED DATA. THE IO-LCA APPROACH PRODUCED COMPARABLE RESULTS WITH THE ONES PUBLISHED IN TRADITIONAL PROCESS-BASED LCA LITERATURE. IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN RESULTS, SOME PRACTICAL BENEFITS OF USING THE IO-LCA COULD ALSO BE SUGGESTED: THE APPROACH WAS VERY FAST TO USE AND WOULD THUS ALLOW AN EASIER ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATIONS IN COMPANIES AS WELL AS WIDER ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING OF PRODUCTS IN EARLY CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE. CONCLUSIONS THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE IO-LCA APPROACH COULD CLEARLY OFFER ADDED VALUE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES. THE IO-LCA WAS FOUND TO PROVIDE A VERY FAST ACCESS TO THE KEY LIFE CYCLE CHARACTERISTICS OF PRODUCTS. SIMILARLY, IT OFFERED PRACTICAL MEANS TO INTEGRATE LIFE CYCLE THINKING INTO EXISTING BUSINESS ROUTINES AND TO ACTIVATE THE DECISION MAKERS IN COMPANIES BY GIVING THEM EASILY COMPREHENDIBLE RESULTS. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES THE RESULTS WOULD SUGGEST THAT SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL IO TABLES, BESIDES THE US ONES USED HERE, WOULD HAVE VALUE AND SHOULD BE COLLECTED FOR OTHER MAJOR GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMICAL REGIONS. THE TABLES WOULD ENABLE A MUCH LARGER SHARE OF COMPANIES TO MANAGE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. IT ALSO SEEMS THAT, BECAUSE THE USER PROFILE IS SO DOMINANT IN THE CASE OF ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS, MORE STUDIES, BOTH THEORETICAL (HOW TO VALUATE THE FUTURE BEHAVIOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES?) AND EMPIRICAL (WHAT REALLY CREATES VALUE FOR USERS?), SHOULD FOCUS ON THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","AALTO UNIVERSITY",NA,"SEPPO.JUNNILA@TKK.FI",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-008-0015-y","330RN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0948-3349","INT.

BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT ARE INTEGRATED IN THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY AND EMBODIED GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS OF DESIGN OPTIONS. THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATA USED TO DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK WERE EXTRACTED FROM BIM MODELS FOR THE BUILDING MATERIAL QUANTITIES, VERIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPD) FOR THE MATERIAL PRODUCTION STAGE, AND THE DESIGN OF CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND END-OF-LIFE STAGES. APPLICATION OF THE DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK TO A CASE STUDY OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING REVEALED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS. THE MATERIAL PRODUCTION STAGE HAD THE HIGHEST CONTRIBUTION TO EMBODIED IMPACTS, REACHING ABOUT 90\%. COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL RCC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 41\% MORE LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 34\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY. WHEN EACH SYSTEM WAS CREDITED WITH THE NET BENEFITS RESULTING FROM POSSIBLE RECYCLING/REUSE BEYOND BUILDING LIFE, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 10\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 68\% LESS LIFE CYCLE EMBODIED ENERGY. SIMILARLY, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 29\% LESS LIFE CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM HAD 62\% LESS LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS. SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RCC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED ZERO LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CREDIT POINTS, THE HRS CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED THREE LEED CREDIT POINTS, WHILE THE LSC CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM RECEIVED FIVE LEED CREDIT POINTS.","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); CAIRO UNIVERSITY","461","M.ABOUHAMAD@ENG.CU.EDU.EG ABUHAMD@ENG.CU.EDU.EG",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.3390/su13020461","PY0TL","2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SUSTAINABILITY","SUSTAINABILITY","ENGLISH","JAN",NA,"42","2","GREEN PUBLISHED, GOLD","ABOUHAMAD, MONA/0000-0002-3278-2655 ABU-HAMD, METWALLY/0000-0001-9176-5540",NA,NA,"MDPI","SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY","ABOUHAMAD, MONA/HFZ-9739-2022 ABU-HAMD, METWALLY/ABC-4643-2020 ABOUHAMAD, MONA/C-6102-2019 ",NA,36,"LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR EMBODIED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS","ARTICLE","WOS000611762500001","8","69","13","GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES","SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED); SOCIAL SCIENCE CITATION INDEX (SSCI)",2021,"ABOUHAMAD MONA;ABU-HAMD METWALLY","ABU-HAMD, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CAIRO UNIV, FAC ENGN, GIZA 12613, EGYPT","ISI","SUSTAINABILITY","none","CAIRO UNIV;CAIRO UNIV","CAIRO UNIV",NA,"ABOUHAMAD M, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY","ABOUHAMAD M, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA

OPTIMIZATION METHODS ARE AT HAND, BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW TO CONNECT AND COORDINATE THE UPDATING OF THE DOMAIN MODELS OF EACH DISCIPLINE AND CENTRALIZE THE PRODUCT DEFINITION INTO ONE SOURCE INSTEAD OF HAVING SEVERAL UNCONNECTED PRODUCT DEFINITIONS. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) FEATURES THE IDEA OF CENTRALIZING THE PRODUCT DEFINITION TO A BIM-MODEL AND CREATING INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN MODELS FROM DIFFERENT DOMAINS AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH REPORTS ON DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FIELDS WITHIN CONSTRUCTION. RECENT RESEARCH FEATURES BIM-BASED OPTIMIZATION, BUT THERE IS STILL A QUESTION OF KNOWING HOW TO DESIGN A BIM-BASED PROCESS USING NEUTRAL FILE FORMATS TO ENABLE MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION OF LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY AND COST. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR NEUTRAL BIM-BASED MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION. THE FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF (1) A CENTRALIZED MASTER MODEL, FROM WHICH DIFFERENT DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC DOMAIN MODELS ARE GENERATED AND EVALUATED; AND (2) AN OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM CONTROLLING THE OPTIMIZATION LOOP. BASED ON THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK, A PROTOTYPE WAS DEVELOPED AND USED IN A CASE STUDY OF A SWEDISH MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING TO TEST THE FRAMEWORK'S APPLICABILITY IN GENERATING AND OPTIMIZING MULTIPLE MODELS BASED ON THE BIM-MODEL. THE PROTOTYPE WAS DEVELOPED TO ENHANCE THE BUILDING'S SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE BY OPTIMIZING THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE BUILDING'S LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY (LCE) AND LIFE-CYCLE COST (LCC) WHEN CHOOSING MATERIAL FOR THE ENVELOPE.

LCA PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OF PRODUCTS AND BUILDINGS. IN SOME COUNTRIES, ASSESSMENTS ARE NOW BEING REQUIRED AS PART OF THE PLANNING SUBMISSIONS FOR BUILDING PROJECTS. AND EXISTING BUILDING ENVIRONMENT CERTIFICATIONS SYSTEMS, SUCH AS BREEAM AND LEED, REQUIRE A FORM OF CARBON ASSESSMENT. THIS HAS INCREASED THE DEMAND FOR MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPDS) TO SUPPORT ASSESSMENTS AND DESIGN DECISIONS AT BUILDING SCALE, WHILST ALSO BEING USED FOR PRODUCT PROCUREMENT. LCA RESULTS ARE OFTEN PRESENTED AS DETERMINISTIC VALUES AND UNCERTAINTY IS OFTEN IGNORED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS IN THE CASE OF COMPARATIVE LCA WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTENTION CAN BE TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY SELECTING A PRODUCT OR DESIGN ALTERNATIVE WITH A LOWER FOOTPRINT. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE APPROACHES FOR DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN LCA IN GENERAL, AND IN THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF LCA TO CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS AND BUILDINGS. BUILDINGS ARE COMPLEX AND REPRESENTING THIS IN AN LCA, WHICH IS A MODEL OF REALITY, CAN BE CHALLENGING. THE LARGEST IMPACT SAVINGS ARE ACHIEVED DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN WHERE UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY IN DESIGN ARE HIGH. THEREFORE, ADDRESSING AND COMMUNICATING UNCERTAINTY HERE IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL. BARRIERS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION IN EPDS AND THE LACK OF A CONSISTENT UNCERTAINTY PROCEDURE, ARE DISCUSSED. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE REPORTING OF UNCERTAINTY INFORMATION AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENTS IN EPDS, ACCESSIBLE DIGITISED EPD INFORMATION AND INTEGRATION OF UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN BUILDING LCA SOFTWARE. AS IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS, BOTH BUILDING CARBON ASSESSMENTS AND TRADITIONAL LCA, SUGGEST, THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING OF ASSUMPTIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS BLOCKCHAIN AND THEINTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) ARE ONE OF THE MAIN PILLARS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS REVOLUTION. THE INTEGRATION OF DECENTRALISED NETWORKS AND AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A PIVOTAL FACTOR IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN SUPPLY CHAIN ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN THE OFF-SITE MANUFACTURING FIELD. OBSTACLES RELATED TO FRAGMENTED INFORMATION, INTEROPERABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND ``BIG DATA'' MANAGEMENT ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR CHANGE THAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO ADDRESS. WHILST ORGANISATIONS AND USERS CAN AUTOMATE WORKFLOWS AND PROCESSES BY UTILISING IOT TECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFER DATA WITHOUT HUMAN-TO-HUMAN OR HUMAN-TO-COMPUTER INTERACTION, THE INTERACTION, STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE DATA GENERATED ARE NOT SAFE OR RELIABLE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE APPROACH OUTLINED IN THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGES THAT IOT AND CENTRALISED NETWORKS PRESENT. BLOCKCHAIN, A PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTED DATABASE, OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN THE ASSET INFORMATION WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS IN ALL THE STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE. THE SYNERGY BETWEEN THESE TECHNOLOGIES, ALONG WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES, METHODS AND PLATFORMS (SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM)), BASED ON A SINGLE ENVIRONMENT, WILL SUPPORT INFORMATION TRACEABILITY FROM THE STRATEGIC DEFINITION TO END OF LIFE. FINDINGS THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY NEW WORKFLOWS AND PROCESSES WITH THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROTOCOLS. IT BENEFITS FROM A WELL-ESTABLISHED PLATFORM SUCH AS BIM TO ENABLE THE COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIGITAL ASSETS AS WELL AS GIVING ILLUSTRATION AND COLLABORATION TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN MEMBERS. IOT AND BLOCKCHAIN ARE THE OTHER LAYERS THAT WORK TOGETHER WITH THE THIRD LAYER (BIM). THIS FRAMEWORK PROPOSED THE USE OF THESE PLATFORMS TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION TRACEABILITY OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL ASSETS, DATA AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, IN A DYNAMIC SUPPLY CHAIN ECOSYSTEM, BRINGING EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY TO STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK TO BE USED BY THE SUPPLY CHAIN MEMBERS IN OFFSITE MANUFACTURING, AND THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) INDUSTRY IN GENERAL, TO TRACK ASSET INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE SECURELY AND TRANSPARENTLY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF IOT, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BIM USE IN OFFSITE MANUFACTURING UNDER THE AEC INDUSTRY.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN INTEGRATED REVIEW COMBINING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES TO CLARIFY THE DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP OF BIM-ENABLED BUILDING AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS. FIRSTLY, INFORMATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT IN DIGITAL TWIN AND ROBOTIC BUILDING TASKS IS RECAPPED AS THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. SECONDLY, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON BIM-RELATED RESEARCH TOPICS IN THE LAST 18 YEARS IS CONDUCTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE INEVITABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF BIM-ROBOT INTEGRATION, INFORMED BY THE EVOLUTION OF LIFECYCLE BUILDING INFORMATION FLOW. THEN, CRITICAL ANALYSIS ON THREE TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF BIM-BASED ROBOTIC CONSTRUCTION (I.E.

IN EVALUATING HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL USE, MOST GREEN CHEMISTRY METRICS ONLY CONSIDER THOSE CHEMICALS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNTHESIS AND MISS UPSTREAM HAZARDS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OR EVEN DOMINATE OVERALL IMPACTS WHEN EVALUATED USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). CONVERSELY, LCA METRICS ARE WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON EMISSIONS AND DO NOT CAPTURE POTENTIAL RISKS POSED BY INHERENTLY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. LIFE CYCLE INHERENT TOXICITY I* IS A PROPOSED NOVEL METRIC THAT ADAPTS THE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF LCA BY ATTACHING MEASURES OF INHERENT HAZARD TO THE INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL FLOWS, RATHER THAN CONSIDERING ONLY EMISSIONS. THUS, IT CAPTURES TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTIRE CRADLE-TO-GATE OF A CHEMICAL, RATHER THAN JUST DIRECT CHEMICAL INPUTS INTO A SYNTHESIS, AND IS A FUNCTION OF UPSTREAM USE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, RATHER THAN ONLY EMISSIONS. VALUES OF I* ARE CALCULATED FOR 181 ORGANIC CHEMICALS FROM THE ECOINVENT LCI DATABASE. STATISTICAL TESTING REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN LIFE CYCLE INHERENT TOXICITY AND CONVENTIONAL TOXICITY, SUGGESTING THAT THE PROPOSED METRIC PROVIDES NOVEL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURRENT GREEN CHEMISTRY METRICS. OUTLIERS ARE INVESTIGATED WHERE THE TARGET CHEMICAL IS MUCH MORE TOXIC THAN ITS UPSTREAM BUILDING BLOCKS (E.G., PHOSGENE) AND, CONVERSELY, WHERE UPSTREAM CHEMICAL TOXICITY DOMINATES (E.G., ANILINE).

THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE OF LCA IN THE AEC COMMUNITY AND THEN DISCUSSES THE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO THE PRACTICE OF LCA. IN SUMMARY, THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO IDENTIFY WHY LCA IS NOT USED TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL IN A WHOLE-BUILDING LCA. IN AN OPEN FORUM AND MODERATED SETTING, FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED INDIVIDUALLY TO SELF-IDENTIFY THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH LCA, A BRIEF EDUCATION SESSION ON LCA WAS HELD, AND THEN BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO LCA WERE DISCUSSED. THE FOCUS GROUP SESSIONS WERE TRANSCRIBED AND SYSTEMATICALLY CODED BY SOCIAL RESEARCHERS IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS. HYBRID FLOW AND RADAR CHARTS WERE DEVELOPED. FROM THE FOCUS GROUP RESULTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT BENEFIT TO LCA WAS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE RESULTS DID NOT IDENTIFY A PROMINENT BARRIER; HOWEVER, BUILDING-RELATED METRICS WERE ASCERTAINED TO BE ONE OF THE MORE CRUCIAL BARRIERS.

THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL FOR OPTIMIZATION AND REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS LIES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DESIGN PROCESS. THEREFORE, A DESIGN-INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR LCA IS NEEDED. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PARAMETRIC LCA TOOL FOR APPLICATION IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES IN THE SWISS CONTEXT. THE ENVISIONED USERS OF THE TOOL ARE PRIMARILY ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING STUDENTS, BUT ALSO PRACTITIONERS. THE INTEGRATION OF LCA THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS IS SOLVED THROUGH A MODULAR STRATEGY. IN THE EARLY STAGE, PRE-DEFINED COMPONENTS ARE SELECTED TO MODEL A COMPLETE LCA. IN THE FOLLOWING DESIGN STEPS WHEN MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE, INDIVIDUAL MATERIALS CAN BE INPUT WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF DETAIL. THE BOMBYX TOOL IS DEVELOPED AS A PLUGIN FOR GRASSHOPPER BASED ON RHINOCEROS3D AND INCLUDES AN SQL MATERIAL AND COMPONENT DATABASE. USERS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND BUILDING SYSTEMS AND QUICKLY MODIFY THE BUILDING'S GEOMETRY WHILE CONTINUOUSLY RECEIVING THE CALCULATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IN REAL-TIME. VISUALIZATION OF THE RESULTS, E.G. COLOUR CODE INDICATE HOW THE DESIGN PERFORMS IN RELATION TO A BENCHMARK OR OPTIMIZATION POTENTIAL.

IN RESPONSE, THIS STUDY INTEGRATES A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT METHOD WITH FIELD BASED OPERATIONAL DATA TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL EMBODIED ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENERGY TRANSFERS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND ASSESS THE LIFE CYCLE ENERGY USE OF RESIDENTIAL AND OFFICE BUILDINGS IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EMBODIED ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE PROVINCIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS LOCALIZATION DOMINANT AND FOSSIL FUEL ORIENTED, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 18.6\% OF THE TOTAL REGIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THE GEOGRAPHICAL CONNECTION AND RESOURCE CHARACTERISTIC ARE THE TWO FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE INTERREGIONAL ENERGY TRANSMISSIONS INDUCED BY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE. THE RESULT OF UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE MEAN VALUE OF ENERGY INTENSITIES SIMULATED BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION IS HIGHLY CONSISTENT WITH THE DETERMINISTIC RESULTS.

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED OR DEVELOPED TOOLS FOR THE LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT OF DURABILITY PERFORMANCE OF BUILT STRUCTURES LEVERAGING BIM. THIS GAP IS PARTLY DUE TO (I) THE LACK OF AN ACCESSIBLE INTERFACE THAT CONNECTS BIM SOFTWARE WITH DURABILITY MODELS OF BUILT STRUCTURES, AND (II) NO AVAILABLE DURABILITY MODELS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL IN NATURE AND THUS CAN INTEGRATE WITH OTHER TOOLS. TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THIS GAP, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK THAT USES THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) WITHIN BIM TO INTEGRATE PHYSICS-BASED DURABILITY PERFORMANCE MODELS, WHICH EXTENDS THE APPLICATION OF BIM INTO THE POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASES BY ENABLING MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE. AN APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK IS PRESENTED FOR ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF A REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURE.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","103004","JIEWU22@STANFORD.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103004","KR5NK","1872-7891",NA,NA,"STANFORD UNIVERSITY; UNITED STATES NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [1453881]; DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING; DIV OF CIVIL, MECHANICAL, \& MANUFACT INN [1453881] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK PROFESSOR METTE GEIKER AT THE NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSORS HENRIK STANG AND ALEXANDER MICHEL AT THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK, AND DR.

ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ANALYZED THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR A SINGLE BUILDING OR FOR THE WHOLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, FEW OF THEM INVESTIGATED THE LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT THE CITY LEVEL. SINCE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE KEY IMPLEMENTERS FOR THE REDUCTION OF URBAN ENERGY CONSUMPTION, A CITY-LEVEL ANALYSIS ON THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IS HIGHLY NEEDED FOR THE POLICY MAKING.

HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL MATERIALS USED TO ACCOMPLISH ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARE NOT USUALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE-CYCLE COST ASSESSMENT (LCCA) APPROACHES HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY APPLIED TO ANALYZE BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS. HOWEVER, LCA AND LCCA ARE TIME-CONSUMING AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE AND ARE USUALLY PERFORMED IN LATE DESIGN STAGES WHEN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE IMPACTS IS COSTLY TO ACHIEVE. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED, STREAMLINED LCA-LCCA APPROACH TO BUILDING RETROFITS TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS AT EARLY-DESIGN STAGE DECISIONS. WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK THAT FULLY INTEGRATES A STREAMLINED EMBODIED LCA, STATISTICAL-BASED OPERATIONAL ENERGY, AND COST MODELS. THIS APPROACH INCORPORATES UNCERTAINTY TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF INFORMATION IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES BY USING THE BUILDING ATTRIBUTE TO IMPACT ALGORITHM APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES STRUCTURED UNDER-SPECIFICATION AND PROBABILISTIC TRIAGE. AN AUTOMATED PROCESS ENABLES SEVERAL SCENARIOS TO BE ASSESSED AND COMPARED AS A MEANS OF BETTER INFORMING DESIGNERS OF THE RELATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF MATERIALS AND DIMENSIONING CHOICES.

WIDELY ADOPTED ASSESSMENT METHODS CONSIDER EITHER SINGLE ISSUES OR DO NOT COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS LINKS BETWEEN ISSUES. ONE EXCEPTION IS THE CLEER MODEL, WHICH COMPARES LIFE CYCLE ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS OF CLOUD-BASED AND PRESENT-DAY SERVICES. HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS THE NEED TO VERIFY COMPONENTS FOR INCLUSION IN A DATA CENTRE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), ASSESS QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF SECONDARY DATA, BENCHMARK AN EXISTING DATA CENTRE LCA, ASSESS NON-CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR MULTIPLE IMPACTS, AND ESTABLISH FACILITY AREAS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE. A HYBRID APPROACH, COMBINING PROCESS-BASED AND ECONOMIC INPUT OUTPUT (EIO) DATA, WAS USED TO PERFORM THE SCREENING LCA OF AN EXISTING UK DATA CENTRE. THE STUDY INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF THE GOAL AND SCOPE, MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS, A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION AND A SENSITIVITY CHECK. THE DOMINANCE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) OPERATIONAL PHASE TO THE OVERALL IMPACT AND THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH ARE CONCLUDED. DUE TO THE USE OF FREE COOLING, THE IT-EMBODIED IMPACT IS GREATER THAN THE COMBINED MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL OPERATIONAL IMPACT. ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION DOMINATES THE TOTAL LIFE CYCLE IMPACT; HOWEVER, THE SECOND MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT DERIVES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF METAL REFINING WASTE PRODUCTS DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF IT COMPONENTS AND ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. THE RELEASE OF CARCINOGENS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT AND IS ALMOST EQUAL IN VALUE BETWEEN THE EMBODIED AND OPERATIONAL PHASES. FINALLY, A SENSITIVITY CHECK FOUND THAT A SWEDISH FACILITY OPTIMISED FOR OPERATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH A 1.25-YEAR SERVER REFRESH RESULTED IN AN EMBODIED IMPACT ALMOST DOUBLE THE OPERATIONAL. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT CURRENT LCI DATA, SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND PROJECT DATA ALLOW FOR A SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE DATA CENTRE LCA MODEL. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE NEED TO BROADEN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION TO BEYOND OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR COOLING AND THAT BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS (BEAMS) SHOULD CONSIDER MORE EMBODIED IMPACTS. IT IS CONCLUDED ALSO THAT THREE PARAMETERS ARE SENSITIVE TO DESIGN CHANGES THAT INFLUENCE THE OVERALL IMPACT: OPERATIONAL ENERGY FOR THE IT EQUIPMENT, COOLING AND POWER DELIVERY; THE ENERGY MIX; AND THE AMOUNT OF IT EQUIPMENT ACROSS THE FACILITY'S LIFETIME.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A METHOD TO PERFORM LCEA AND TO ASSESS AND CONSEQUENTLY STRATEGICALLY REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN BUILDINGS' INFORMATION ON THE LCEA IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IS USED TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF UNCERTAINTY ON LCEA AND TO PRIORITIZE DECISIONS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY. THE METHOD IS EMBEDDED IN A MULTI-LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (LOD) MODELLING APPROACH COVERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUILDING DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN. THE METHOD IS APPLIED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT BUILDING SHAPES AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE METHOD RENDERS VALID RESULTS TO ASSESS THE PROJECT-SPECIFIC UNCERTAINTY IN LCEA RESULTS.

YET, RESEARCH ON THE EARLY EVALUATION OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD IN ORDER TO AID THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS HITHERTO LACKING. IN LIGHT OF THIS DILEMMA, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD BY EMPLOYING ONLY THE MOST BASIC INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE DURING THE EARLY DESIGN PHASES OF A PROJECT FOR THE PRE-STRESSED CONCRETE (PSC) BEAM BRIDGE, THE MOST COMMON BRIDGE STRUCTURE. FIRSTLY, A LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) WAS CONDUCTED ON THE DATA FROM 99 BRIDGES BY INTEGRATING THE BILLS OF QUANTITIES (BOQ) WITH A LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) DATABASE. THE PROCESSED DATA WAS THEN UTILIZED TO CONSTRUCT A CASE BASED REASONING (CBR) MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD. THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATION MODEL WAS THEN VALIDATED USING FIVE TEST CASES; THE MODEL'S MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR RATES (MAER) FOR THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD WAS CALCULATED AS 7.09\%.

THUS, THE NEED TO EVALUATE AND SELECT MORE SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION SOLUTIONS ARISES, TO ALSO MINIMIZE IMPACTS FROM THESE STAGES. TO EVALUATE THOSE IMPACTS, LCA AND LCC ANALYSIS ARE USUALLY APPLIED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING IMPACTS AND COSTS, THROUGH THE DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLE STAGES.

TO REALIZE THE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF LCA TOOLS AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY MINIMIZE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS, AN OPEN APPROACH IS REQUIRED THAT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBLE APPLICATION OF COMPREHENSIVE LCA STUDIES AND EARLY INTEGRATION IN PLANNING PROCESSES. THE AUTHORS PRESENT AN APPROACH FOR LCA INTEGRATION IN ALL PHASES OF DIGITAL PLANNING WHICH AIMS AT A DGNB (DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR NACHHALTIGES BAUEN) CERTIFICATION BASED ON THE OPEN BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) STANDARD INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC). THE APPROACH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARYING LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT AND RESULTING DATA AVAILABILITY DURING INTEGRAL PLANNING PHASES, AS WELL AS RESULTING LCA APPLICATION CONTEXTS. IT GOES BEYOND EXISTING STRATEGIES AND ALLOWS ONE TO CONSIDER BOTH BIM AND LCA SOFTWARE THROUGH A WORKFLOW BASED ON A SINGLE DATA FORMAT. THE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK IS OPERATIONALIZED THROUGH STANDARDIZED INTERFACE DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL REALIZATION FOLLOWING THE INFORMATION DELIVERY MANUAL (IDM) PROCESS STANDARDIZED FOR IFC INTERFACES. THE EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE (XML) SCHEMA, AS A SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION FOR CERTIFICATION, PROVIDES THE TARGET SYSTEM FOR LCA DATA REQUIREMENTS AND IS GENERALIZED TO A PLANNING PHASE SPECIFIC IDM BASE TABLE.

A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) DATABASE IS USED FOR TACKLING THE INTEROPERABILITY ISSUES ALLOWING DIFFERENT USERS TO ACCESS AND SHARE THE DATA. TO SECURELY AND EFFICIENTLY STORE DATA ON RFID TAGS IN IFCXML FORMAT, MULTI-LEVEL ENCRYPTION TOGETHER WITH ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL IS APPLIED ON THE DATA STORED ON RFID TAGS. EACH USER IS ASSIGNED A CERTAIN ROLE AND CAN ONLY ACCESS THE PART OF DATA FOR WHICH HE HAS AUTHORIZATION ACCORDING TO A PREDEFINED ROLE AND THE ACCESS CONTROL POLICY. TO EXPLORE THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH, A CASE STUDY CONSIDERING BOTH FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED AT CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY.

SINCE ENVELOPE OPTIMIZATION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF GREEN BUILDINGS, VALUE ENGINEERING (VE) TECHNOLOGY AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY ARE USED TO OPTIMIZE THE ENVELOPE OF GREEN BUILDINGS, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BOTH ENERGY SAVING AND LIFE CYCLE COST. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF OPTIMIZATION FOR GREEN BUILDING ENVELOPE BASED ON BIM-VE IS PROPOSED, INCLUDING A BIM MODEL FOR ARCHITECTURE, A LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS MODEL, ENERGY-SAVING ANALYSIS MODEL, AND A VALUE ANALYSIS MODEL. IN THE LIFE-CYCLE COST MODEL, A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR THE LIFE-CYCLE COST IS ESTABLISHED, AND BIM TECHNOLOGY IS USED TO GENERATE A BILL OF QUANTITY. IN THE ENERGY-SAVING ANALYSIS MODEL, A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR ENERGY SAVING IS ESTABLISHED, AND BIM TECHNOLOGY IS USED FOR THE BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION. IN THE SCHEME DECISION-MAKING SUB-MODEL, VE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATING LIFE CYCLE COST WITH ENERGY SAVING IS USED TO ASSESS THE ENVELOPE SCHEMES AND SELECT THE OPTIMAL ONE. A PREFABRICATED PROJECT CASE IS USED TO SIMULATE AND TEST THE ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY. THE IMPORTANT RESULTS SHOW THAT THE 16 ENVELOPE SCHEMES MAKE THE 16 CORRESPONDING DESIGNED BUILDINGS MEET THE GREEN BUILDING EVALUATION STANDARDS, AND THE OPTIMAL ENVELOPE SCHEME IS THE ``ENERGY-SAVING AND ANTI-THEFT DOOR + EXTERIOR WINDOW 2+ FLOOR 1+ EXTERIOR WALL 1 + INNER SHEAR WALL + INNER PARTITION WALL 2 + PLANTED ROOF'' WITH THE VALUE 10.80 X 10(-2) MW CENTER DOT H/TEN THOUSAND YUAN. A SIGNIFICANT FINDING IS THAT THE VALUE GENERALLY RISES WITH THE INCREASE OF ENERGY-SAVING RATE WHILE THE LIFE CYCLE COST IS IRREGULAR WITH THE INCREASE OF ENERGY-SAVING RATE. COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS EFFORTS IN THE LITERATURE, THIS STUDY INTRODUCES VE TECHNOLOGY INTO ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN TO FURTHER EXPAND THE CURRENT BOUNDARY OF BUILDING ENERGY-SAVING THEORY.

THEREFORE UTILIZATIONS OF OVERSEAS LCI WITH VALID MODIFICATION HAVE BECOME AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO EXPAND THE USAGE OF EXISTING LCI AS WELL AS TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH A LOCALIZED INVENTORY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK WHICH MAKES USE OF NON LOCAL LCI DATA AND BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF LOCAL CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS-SPECIFICALLY, TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE ``CRADLE TO SITE'' PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. FRAMEWORK INPUTS, OUTPUTS AND DATA CONVERSION METHODS ARE ANALYSED IN A DETAILED MANNER. A CASE STUDY IN SINGAPORE WHICH FOCUSES ON CARBON EMISSIONS GENERATED FROM CEMENT PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION IS EMPLOYED TO SHOWCASE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IN LCA PRACTICE. THE RESULT OBTAINED WAS COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL BENCHMARK TO VALIDATE THE FRAMEWORK'S PERFORMANCE. THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF ERROR WAS 2\%, WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ONE FROM RAW LCI OF 14\%. DISCUSSION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REGARDING TO THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF UNCERTAINTY HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCUSSED.

BECAUSE PREFABRICATED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (PCPS) ARE INTERORGANIZATIONAL IN NATURE, THEIR SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY, ESPECIALLY UNDER UNCERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RELIES ON ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AN ETHNOGRAPHY-BASED METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PCPS TO EVALUATE, ANALYZE, AND IMPROVE THE DYNAMIC ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE REGARDING EFFICIENCY, FLEXIBILITY, AND ROBUSTNESS FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. A TWO-PART FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED. THE QUALITATIVE FIRST PART IDENTIFIES THE ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS OF PARTICIPATING STAKEHOLDERS DURING EACH PROJECT PHASE, AND THE SECOND QUANTITATIVE PART MEASURES AND ANALYZES THE PCP'S ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE. A TYPICAL ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION (EPC) CONTRACT PCP IN CHINA IS USED AS A CASE ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THIS DEVELOPED FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ROBUSTNESS AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE PCP SHOULD BE IMPROVED. SUCH IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY MANAGING AND ENHANCING THE WORKFLOW CONTROL AND HOW STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNICATE. THIS SCENARIO WAS EXAMINED VIA A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYING BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) AND DECENTRALIZED COLLABORATION PLATFORM (DCP) WITHIN THE CASE PROJECT.

THE INNOVATION POINTS INCLUDE BIG-DATA INFORMATION, INTEGRATED RETROFITTING DESIGN, AND LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMISATION THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMY, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT. THE OPTIMAL RETROFITTING PLAN IS SELECTED TO MAXIMISE ITS LIFE-TIME COST-SAVING, ENERGY REDUCTION AND CARBON REDUCTION. THE PROPOSED RETROFITTING OPTIMISATION APPROACH IS TESTED ON A REAL-WORLD BUILDING. THE STANDARD RETROFITTING OPTIONS INCLUDE ROOF INSULATION, WALL INSULATION, WIND TURBINE, SOLAR HEATER, BIOMASS BOILER, COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM AND PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL. THE HISTORICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, BUILDING INFORMATION, HISTORICAL WEATHER DATA, AND INVENTORY DATA IS ADOPTED IN THE DATA DRIVEN MODEL TO REPLICATE THE REAL-WORLD CASE.

THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE INCREASINGLY BEING FELT AND RESPON-SIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION AND ADAPTION, WHICH MUST INCLUDE THE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMIS-SION IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW RESIDENTIAL STOCK. MITIGATION STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON DECREASING THE OPERATIONAL GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDINGS, LEAVING THE OTHER LIFE CYCLE STAGES, SUCH AS CONSTRUCTION, LARGELY IGNORED. TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL TARGETS, SUCH AS ZERO NET EMISSIONS BY 2050, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS MITIGATION FROM A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT BASED ON CURRENT BUILDING PRACTICES ONE NEW DETACHED DWELLING BUILT TODAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUGHLY 545 TCO(2)E BY 2050. THIS TRANSLATES TO THE NEED TO PLANT OVER 8,000 TREES TO OFFSET THESE EMISSIONS, A FIGURE IT IS SAFE TO SAY, MOST HOMEOWNERS WILL NOT ACHIEVE. THIS STUDY MODELLED LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF ALL NEW DETACHED DWELLINGS CONSTRUCTED IN AUSTRALIA FOR A SINGLE YEAR (2019) ESTIMATING 39 MTCO(2)E, WHICH INCREASES TO 883 MTCO(2)E BY 2030 AND 3,654 MTCO(2)E BY 2050.

UNFORTUNATELY, THESE CONSIDERATIONS ARE NOTORIOUSLY ABSENT IN TODAY'S PRACTICE OWING TO A TRADITIONALLY SEGMENTED APPROACH TO THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT HAS PERPETUATED INTEROPERABILITY CHALLENGES BETWEEN EXISTING COMMERCIAL TOOLS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING APPROACHES, THIS PAPER OFFERS AN INTEGRATED LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (ILCA) THAT (1) CONSIDERS THE EFFECTS OF SITE-SPECIFIC CLIMATE AND EXPOSURE TO WIND AND SEISMIC HAZARDS ON A BUILDING'S EMBODIED AND OPERATING ENERGY, (2) ADOPTS AN ASSEMBLY-BASED APPROACH TO REVEAL THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS INFLUENCING PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES, (3) ACCOMMODATES BOTH RISK-NEUTRAL AND RISK-ADVERSE PERSPECTIVES, AND (4) ADDRESSES INTEROPERABILITY CHALLENGES THAT LIMIT ACCESS TO THE DATA STORED WITHIN COMMERCIAL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS.

LIFE CYCLE THINKING IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED, HOWEVER. LOCALLY AVAILABLE, ALTERNATIVE BUILDING CONCEPTS COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF ``AS-BUILT'' LOW-COST HOUSING FOR AN EXAMPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH USE OF THREE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES: CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAMES, SOIL-CEMENT BLOCKS, AND COCONUT BOARD-BASED HOUSING. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED WITH SOFTWARE SIMAPRO, USING THE SINGLE-IMPACT INDICATORS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) AND CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND (CED) AND THE MULTI-IMPACT INDICATOR IMPACT2002+. ACCORDING TO EN 15978, THE LIFE CYCLE PHASE PRODUCT AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS (A), USE STAGE (B), END-OF-LIFE (C) AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION BEYOND THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE (D) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED. THEORETICALLY CALCULATED INFLOWS FROM STANDARD CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES USED IN PHASE A HAVE BEEN VERIFIED WITH 3 YEARS OF EMPIRICAL DATA FROM IMPLEMENTED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. FOR PHASES B, C AND D, ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO SERVICE LIFE, USE-PHASE, ALLOCATION OF WASTE PRODUCTS, BIOGENIC CARBON AND LAND-USE ASSUMPTIONS. SCENARIOS REFLECT THE ACTUAL SITUATION IN THE EMERGING ECONOMY. PROCESSES, SUCH AS HEAT RECOVERY FROM THERMAL UTILIZATION, WHICH ARE NOT EXISTING NOR NEAR TO IMPLEMENTATION, WERE EXCLUDED. FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PHASES A-B-C-D WITH GWP, A 35\% REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FOR SOIL-CEMENT BLOCKS, 74\% FOR CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAME, AND 83\% FOR COCONUT BOARD-BASED HOUSES IS OBTAINED RELATIVE TO A CONCRETE REFERENCE HOUSE. IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, THIS RELATES TO A REDUCTION OF 4.4, 9.3, AND 10.3 T CO2 EQUIVALENTS OVER A SERVICE LIFE OF 25 YEARS. CED SHOWED HIGHER IMPACTS FOR THE BIOGENIC CONSTRUCTION METHODS COCONUT BOARD AND CEMENT-BAMBOO FRAMES OF +8.0 AND +4.7\%, WHILE THE SOIL-CEMENT TECHNOLOGY WAS EVALUATED -7.1\% COMPARED TO GWP. SIXTEEN OF 17 MIDPOINT CATEGORIES OF IMPACT2002+ CONFIRMED AN OVERALL REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF THE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING METHODS, WITH THE MIDPOINT CATEGORY LAND OCCUPATION BEING THE EXCEPTION RATING THE CONVENTIONAL PRACTICE OVER THE ALTERNATIVES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN CAUSED BY THE SOCIAL HOUSING SECTOR. THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES PLAYS A VITAL ROLE FOR IT. LCA FOR EMERGING ECONOMIES NEEDS TO INCORPORATE REALISTIC SCENARIOS APPLICABLE AT THEIR CURRENT STATE OR BELONGING TO THE MOST PROBABLE ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE VALUABLE RESULTS.

PRODUCT AND PROCESS LIFE-CYCLE DATA CAN FACILITATE CIRCULAR ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESERVING THE ASSET'S VALUE OVER TIME AND REDUCING RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. MANY SCHOLARS POINT OUT HOW THE LOSS OF TRACEABILITY DATA, LACKING INFORMATION RELIABILITY, AND UNSTRUCTURED DATA ARE STILL BARRIERS TO THE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF CE. IN THE BUILDING FACADE SECTOR, AN INCREASED INTEREST ON TRACEABILITY IS DICTATED BY A GROWING DEMAND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE ASPECTS ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO COLLECT DATA AT SUPPLY CHAIN STAGE, THUS NEGLECTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PRODUCED DURING THE ASSET SERVICE LIFE. TO FOSTER AN ACCESSIBLE AND LIFE-CYCLE ORIENTED ASSET TRACEABILITY, THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATES THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) AS A POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR SUPPORTING INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TWOFOLD: (I) TO IDENTIFY WHAT FACADE LIFE-CYCLE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO PROMOTE CE AND (II) TO CLARIFY THE ENABLING ROLE OF IOT IN TRACKING, STORING, AND SHARING SUCH INFORMATION. THROUGH A SCOPING REVIEW COMBINED WITH INTERVIEWS TO PROFESSIONALS, A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK STRUCTURED ON FOUR KEY ELEMENTS (STAKEHOLDERS, INFORMATION LIST, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS, AND IOT) IS PROPOSED TO FILL THE LITERATURE GAP AND SUPPORT FACADE INDUSTRY IN THE CIRCULAR TRANSITION.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW (SLR) IS SELECTED AS THE MAIN RESEARCH METHOD OF THE PRESENT PAPER, AIMING TO COLLECT AND CRITICALLY ANALYZE MULTIPLE RESEARCH STUDIES. THIS PAPER IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO STUDIES WHERE THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE HAS BEEN ASSESSED BUT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER PAPERS WHICH ONLY INTEGRATED BIM TO ANALYZE CARBON FOOTPRINT, EMBODIED CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) OR ENERGY CONSUMPTION. FINDINGS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE PUBLISHED ARTICLES ABOUT THE SUBJECT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEDUCE THAT IT HAS BEEN STUDIED IN ALL OF THE CONTINENTS, EXCEPT AFRICA. IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER CONTINENTS, ASIA AND EUROPE HAVE DEVELOPED MORE STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, 76\% OF THE 34 SELECTED ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS AND ONLY 24\% IN CONFERENCES PROCEEDINGS, AND THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT RELATES LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODS USING BIM HAS GROWN FROM 2013 TO 2015, PROVING THAT THE CURRENT THEME IS RELEVANT. SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THIS LITERATURE REVIEW SHOW THE NEED TO DEVELOP AUTOMATED PROCESSES FOR LCA OF BUILDINGS DURING THE PROJECT'S DEVELOPMENT PHASE. THERE IS ALREADY A TENDENCY TO COMPARE LCA RESULTS FOR BUILDINGS APPLIED TO BIM MODELS, CONTRIBUTING TO DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO ALTERNATE PROJECTS, SELECTION OF MATERIALS, SUPPLIERS AND COMPONENTS FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE IN THE CURRENT GLOBAL SCENARIO, IT IS THE NOTORIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT OVER THE YEARS CAUSED BY THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (AEC). THE INTEGRATION OF BIM-LCA CAN REDUCE TIME AND IMPROVE THE APPLICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. MOREOVER, THE PROPER APPLICATION OF A LCA METHOD TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT CAN BE HINDERED DUE TO LACK OF INFORMATION IN THE DATABASE ABOUT THE MATERIALS OR DUE TO FAILURES IN THE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN BIM SOFTWARE AND THE LCA TOOL.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO PARANA; CENTRO UNIVERSITARIO FRANCISCANO DO PARANA (UNIFAE); UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO PARANA",NA,"JULIANNA.CRIPPA@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1108/BEPAM-03-2019-0028","NO7RF","2044-1258","JUN 2020",NA,"BRAZILIAN AGENCY CAPES","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A MASTER'S SCHOLARSHIP FROM THE BRAZILIAN AGENCY CAPES.",NA,"2044-124X","BUILT ENVIRON.

USING PRIMARY INFORMATION, LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE AND LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT DATABASES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EACH STAGE WERE MODELLED. THE OPERATIONAL STAGE OF BOTH CASE STUDIES WAS FOUND TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, FOLLOWED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE END-OF-LIFE STAGE RESPECTIVELY. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND END-OF-LIFE STAGE DECREASED AS THE LIFE SPAN INCREASED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RETROFIT HOUSE STUDIED OUTPERFORMED THE NEW BUILD IN THE ASSEMBLY AND OPERATIONAL STAGE, WHEREAS THE NEW BUILD PERFORMED BETTER IN THE END-OF-LIFE STAGE; HOWEVER, THIS IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE, DEPENDING ON THE STANDARDS TO WHICH BOTH ARE COMPLETED. OPERATIONAL ENERGY SAVINGS PRE - AND POST-RETROFIT WERE SIGNIFICANT, INDICATING THE FUTURE POTENTIAL FOR ADOPTION OF HIGH-QUALITY RETROFITTING PRACTICES.","INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND","QUEENS UNIVERSITY BELFAST; ULSTER UNIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1680/ensu.11.00026","148PU","1751-7680",NA,NA,"SCHOOL OF PLANNING, ARCHITECTURE AND CIVIL ENGINEERING AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST","THE AUTHORS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL OF PLANNING, ARCHITECTURE AND CIVIL ENGINEERING AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST IN CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH.

RESEARCH STUDIES USUALLY FACE CHALLENGES IN PRESENTING COMPREHENSIVE LCA RESULTS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ASSESSMENTS AT THE BUILDING LEVEL. THERE IS A DEARTH OF METHODS FOR THE SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE WBLCA PERFORMANCE AT THE DESIGN STAGE. THE STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE PROPOSED WBLCA METHOD TO EVALUATE AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AT THE BUILDING LEVEL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE WBLCA DEVELOPMENT METHOD IS PROPOSED WITH DETAILED PROCESSES BASED ON THE EN 15978 STANDARD. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION (EPD) METHODS WERE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THE WBLCA IS COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) WAS USED TO ENSURE THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND ASSEMBLY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACCURATE AND PROVIDE DYNAMIC MATERIAL UPDATES FOR THE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, THE INTERACTIVE BIM-LCA CALCULATION PROCESSES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR MEASURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF DESIGN UPGRADES. THE TOPSIS-BASED LCA RESULTS NORMALIZATION WAS SELECTED TO CONDUCT THE COMPARISONS OF VARIOUS BUILDING DESIGN UPGRADES. FINDINGS THE CASE STUDY CONDUCTED FOR A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING SHOWED THAT THE MATERIAL EMBODIED IMPACTS AND THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE IMPACTS ARE THE TWO CRITICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE 60-90\% OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND RESOURCE USES. CONCRETE AND WOOD ARE THE MAIN MATERIAL TYPES ACCOUNTING FOR AN AVERAGE OF 65\% OF THE MATERIAL EMBODIED IMPACTS. THE AIR AND WATER HEATING FOR THE HOUSE ARE THE MAIN ENERGY FACTORS, AS THESE ACCOUNT FOR OVER 80\% OF THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE. BASED ON THE ORIGINAL WBLCA RESULTS, TWO SCENARIOS WERE ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE BUILDING PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE LCA RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TWO UPGRADED BUILDING DESIGNS CREATE AN AVERAGE OF 5\% REDUCTION COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL BUILDING DESIGN AND IMPROVING THE THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF THE HOUSE WITH MORE INSULATION MATERIALS DOES NOT ALWAYS REDUCE THE WBLCA RESULTS. THE PROPOSED WBLCA METHOD CAN BE USED TO COMPARE THE BUILDING-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCES WITH THE SIMILAR BUILDING TYPES. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT BUILDING DESIGNERS TO EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE WBLCA PERFORMANCE.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","NORTHUMBRIA UNIVERSITY",NA,"HAIBO.FENG@NORTHUMBRIA.AC.UK",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1108/IJBPA-06-2021-0091","9S0CK",NA,"JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2398-4708","INT.

THIS RESEARCH EXPLORED LIFE CYCLE ENERGY (LCE), LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC) TO EVALUATE THE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING FACADES FOR THEIR SELECTION. A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK WAS PROPOSED CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS (TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE APPROACH). THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED TO A MEDIUM-RISE COMMERCIAL BUILDING IN THE CITY OF BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL. FOUR BUILDING FACADES (BRICK, GRANITE, ALUMINUM, AND GLASS FACADES) WERE SELECTED AND COMPARED BY THEIR LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS (I.E., IMPACTS IN THE PREUSE, USE, AND POSTURE PHASES). AN ENERGY MODEL WAS DEVELOPED IN DESIGNBUILDER 4.2 TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY DEMAND OF EACH FACADE DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE. LCA OF EACH FACADE WAS PERFORMED USING SIMAPRO 8 SOFTWARE. LATER, SELECTED FACADES WERE COMPARED USING MULTICRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS FOR THREE PROPOSED SCENARIOS: PROENVIRONMENT, NEUTRAL, AND PROECONOMIC. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, BRICK FACADE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FACADE IN THE NEUTRAL AND PROECONOMIC SCENARIO, WHEREAS A GRANITE FACADE WAS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE IN THE PROENVIRONMENT SCENARIO. LIFE CYCLE EMERGY ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THE PROENVIRONMENT SCENARIO RESULTS.

THERE ARE VARIOUS EXISTING INTERPRETATIONS OF BIM AND RELATED ACRONYMS, BUT THESE INTERPRETATIONS ONLY DESCRIBE BIM FROM A SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVE REGARDLESS TO GENERAL RELATIONSHIPS. THIS CAN RESULT IN PROBLEMS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS DURING COMMUNICATION, COORDINATION AND CONTRACTING. RESEARCH SHOWS, THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BIM IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS: 1) BIM AS A PRODUCT, 2) BIM AS A METHOD AND 3) BIM AS A METHODOLOGY. THIS PAPER ALSO EXPLORES BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF BIM AS A METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSES THE CORRECT BIM ONTOLOGY WE USE SCHEMATICS, AND EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF BIM IN TRADITIONAL PROJECT LIFE CYCLE PHASES. WE PROPOSE STRICT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MODEL AND MODELING, AND WE DESCRIBE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIM AND OTHER IM (I.E. PIM, PLIM, CIM, DIM AND AIM).

SECOND, TO USE THE AFOREMENTIONED PLM BUILDING BLOCKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF PLM AND CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEMS. THIRD, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM PROVIDES MORE NEW PRODUCT BENEFITS THAN THE PLM SYSTEM AND THAT THE USAGE OF THE CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 87 MANUFACTURERS IN THE TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN ONE CANADIAN PROVINCE. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ONLY TEN MANUFACTURERS HAVE ADOPTED A CLOSED-LOOP PLM SYSTEM. AS EXPECTED, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TWO KEY PLM BUILDING BLOCKS, NAMELY OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (IS) USAGE, ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

NINE BUILDING ENVELOPE COMBINATIONS WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO FIVE SERVICE LIFE MODELS (N = 45). THREE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS WERE USED: GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, ATMOSPHERIC ECOTOXICITY, AND ATMOSPHERIC ACIDIFICATION FROM THE TOOL FOR THE REDUCTION AND ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSESSMENT METHOD. MULTIVARIATE CORRELATION WAS PERFORMED USING NINE VARIABLES, INCLUDING CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT (FREQUENCY), MINOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPAIRS, MINOR REPAIRS, INSPECTIONS 1 AND 2, AND TOTAL TRANSPORTATION (N = 45, 405 DATA POINTS). THE SAME DATA SET WAS USED FOR THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS, ALTHOUGH THE VARIABLES WERE LIMITED TO MAJOR REPLACEMENT, MINOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPAIR, AND MINOR REPAIR (N = 45, 225 DATA POINTS). SPSS SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR ALL STATISTICAL CALCULATIONS. MULTIVARIATE CORRELATION ANALYSIS SHOWED STRONG, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT AND MAJOR REPLACEMENT ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS. SIMILARLY, THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED STRONG R (2) VALUES BETWEEN CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT AND MAJOR REPLACEMENT, SUCH THAT THE INFLUENCE OF ALL OTHER VARIABLES WAS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE INITIAL FINDINGS OF A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT HAS INVESTIGATED THE INTEGRATION OF WLC ESTIMATION INTO BIM PROCESSES. THE STUDY FOCUSSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE RAPIDLY EMERGING PRIVATE RENTAL SECTOR (PRS) AS THE BUILD-TO-RENT MARKET HAS REPEATABLE TASKS AND SIMILAR WORKFLOW PATTERNS, ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT IMPACTS OF WLC CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE BUSINESS MODEL. THE STUDY ADOPTED A MIXED METHOD APPROACH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A STRUCTURED STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR TIMELY WLC ESTIMATION THROUGH BIM. THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF BARRIERS.

BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, THE PAPER WILL PROPOSE A PROCESS MODEL, NAMELY, LIFECYCLE EXCHANGE OF ASSET DATA (LEAD) TO MANAGE ASSET DATAFLOW BETWEEN ALL BUILDING STAKEHOLDERS FROM DESIGN TO CONSTRUCTION AND ULTIMATELY TO THE FACILITY MANAGEMENT TEAM. THIS MODEL AIMS TO HELP THE CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN TO PRODUCE COMPLETE AND HIGH-QUALITY ASSET DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE OPERATION PHASE OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A REVIEW OF RELEVANT STUDIES PROVIDED A THEORETICAL BACKGROUND FOR THIS STUDY. THE AUTHORS THEN COLLECTED AND ANALYSED COBIE DATA FROM FIVE LIVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) PROJECTS FROM DIFFERENT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES. THE PROCESS MODEL IS BASED ON AN INDUSTRY PLACEMENT WITHIN BOUYGUES UK CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, WHICH WAS A TIER 1 BUILDING CONTRACTOR IN LONDON IN THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 2016 TO DECEMBER 2018. THE RESEARCHER USED AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH OBSERVING CURRENT PRACTISES IN TWO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO PRODUCE ``LEAD'' MODEL. THEN A FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO DISCUSS AND REFINE THE PROCESS MODEL. FINDINGS - ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE AND DATA COLLECTED IN THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT ALTHOUGH COBIE IS A BIM LEVEL 2 STANDARD IN THE UK, THERE IS CURRENTLY A LOW SUCCESS RATE IN PRODUCING COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COBIE DATA IN THE UK CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THIS LOW RATE IS BECAUSE OF COBIE'S RIGID DATA SYNTAX/STRUCTURE, COMPLEXITY AND AMBIGUITY OF ITS DATA EXCHANGE PROCESS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT COBIE MAY NOT BE THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE STUDY PROPOSED A PROCESS MODEL, NAMELY, ``LEAD,'' TO IMPROVE COBIE OUTPUT AND ALSO TO BE USED WITH PROJECT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS PAPER IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO FOCUS SOLELY ON ASSET DATA EXCHANGE PROCESS USING COBIE STANDARD AND HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEMS THE INDUSTRY FACES IN THIS REMIT. THE STUDY IS BASED ON INDUSTRY PLACEMENT FOR TWO YEARS, SO THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON ACTUAL AND CURRENT INDUSTRY PROBLEMS. CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES ALSO INFORMED THE ``LEAD'' MODEL, AND THE MODEL PROVIDES A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDANCE IN PRODUCING AND EXCHANGING BIM ASSET DATA IN ALL STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH COBIE AS AN ASSET DATA EXCHANGE STANDARD. UNDERSTANDING THESE PROBLEMS IS OF HIGH VALUE FOR INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS TO AVOID THEM IN PROJECTS.

SECOND, ITS INNOVATIVE VALUE IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SD-CLCA MODEL. THIS MODEL EVALUATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY-DEMAND IN THE MARKET DUE TO AN INCREASING ADOPTION OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS (SPV) IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. IT ALLOWS TRACEABILITY OF BOTH SYSTEM CHANGES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES, THE SD-CLCA MODEL IS APPLIED TO LISBON MUNICIPALITY AND THE BROADER ELECTRICITY MARKET OF PORTUGAL.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE WASTE CAPACITY OF THE SELECTED DISTRICT AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE CURRENT WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICY VIA LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE TWO INDICATORS; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND ENERGY FLOW. THE DISTRICT HAS 82 BUILDINGS WITH 64,971M2 TOTAL GROSS AREA AND 2,000 POPULATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE DISTRICT'S WASTE CAPACITY WAS EVALUATED WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTES (MSW), LIQUID WASTES, AND DEMOLITION WASTES. THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF THE LCA WERE SET BASED ON THE GATE-TO-GRAVE APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES GENERATED WASTES DURING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BUILDINGS, INCLUDING THEIR END-OF-LIFE STAGE. CONSEQUENTLY, ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIALS FROM WASTE PROCESSES WERE INVESTIGATED AND COMPARED WITH THE PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND OF THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE BUILDINGS TO PERCEIVE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY COMPENSATION RANGE. ADDITIONALLY, BUILDINGS' PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, WHICH OBTAINED FROM THEIR BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS (BIM), ENERGY PERFORMANCES, DERIVED FROM THEIR ENERGY MODELS AND LOCAL SPECIFICATIONS, OBTAINED FROM STANDARDS WERE UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY THE CURRENT CONDITIONS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. CRITICALLY, THE OUTCOMES OF ALL THOSE WERE USED AS INPUT DATA FOR THE LCA MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE HAD BEEN ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIALS FROM MSW'S TREATMENTS, WHILE LIQUID WASTES AND DEMOLISHING WASTES TREATMENTS HAVE CONSUMED ENERGY. ENERGY RECOVERY POTENTIAL FROM MSW HAS COMPENSATED ONLY 5.8\% OF OPERATIONAL ENERGY ANNUALLY, WHICH CAME FROM RECYCLING PROCESSES.

THE DEMAND FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY AND CREDIBILITY OF LCA RESULTS HAS INCREASED THE NEED FOR LCI CONTAINING HIGHER DATA GRANULARITY AND QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS STUDY, A NOVEL DATA PROCESSING METHOD IS PROPOSED TO FACILITATE REGIONALIZED LCI DATABASE COMPILATION AND UNCERTAINTY CHARACTERIZATION. THE KEY STEP IN THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TO RETAIN VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS BY BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND TEMPORAL QUANTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS AND MATERIAL/ENERGY INPUT AMOUNTS USING MULTILEVEL MODELING (MLM) RATHER THAN LOSING THE VARIATIONS VIA A TRADITIONAL AGGREGATION METHOD. THE UNCERTAINTY IS OBJECTIVELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE MODEL PREDICTION INTERVAL. AN EXAMPLE CASE STUDY IS CONDUCTED ON NITROGEN FERTILIZER APPLICATION FOR CORN PRODUCTION WITH DATA COLLECTED IN 19 U.S. STATES FROM 1990 TO 2016. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ESTIMATES BY THE PROPOSED APPROACH ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN THOSE BY CURRENT AGGREGATION METHODS. FOR THE UNIT-YIELD-BASED INPUT AND UNIT-AREA-BASED INPUT, RESPECTIVELY, AROUND 60\% AND 80\% OF VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS ARE EXPLAINED BY MLM, AND 86.1\% AND 96.8\% OF THE UNREPRESENTATIVENESS FACTORS FOR THE MLM ESTIMATES ARE LESS THAN 0.2, COMPARED TO 62.3\% AND 70.5\% WHEN TRADITIONAL THREE-YEAR AGGREGATION IS USED.

EMPIRICAL DATA WERE ANALYSED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, MULTI-ATTRIBUTE METHOD AND FRIEDMAN'S TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. FINDINGS - RESULTS SHOWED THAT DESIGNERS, BUILDING OWNERS, MAIN CONTRACTORS AND PROJECT MANAGERS WERE THE GREATEST INFLUENCERS OF THE PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES IN THE RBLC. THE PRIORITY DRIVERS OF THESE KEY ROLE-PLAYERS' INFLUENCES ON THE RBLC PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES COMPRISED POOR BRIEF INTERPRETATION, INCLINATION TO LOWEST TENDER, INADEQUATE PRIOR RISK ANALYSIS AND MISCOMMUNICATION OF OWNER'S REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS, RESPECTIVELY. BY TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO REDRESS THEIR PRODUCTIVITY INHIBITING ACTS/OMISSIONS AS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY, THE VARIOUS ROLE-PLAYERS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES IN THE BUILDING LIFECYCLE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INTERVIEW ALL PARTICIPANTS THAT MADE UP THE REPRESENTATIVE RANDOM SAMPLES FROM EACH ROLE-PLAYER GROUP DUE LARGELY TO WORKLOAD RELATED EXCUSES. AS A RESULT, THE FINDINGS AND THE CONCLUSIONS MAY NOT BE GENERALISED BEYOND THE STUDY SCOPE. HOWEVER, THE STUDY ACHIEVED ITS PURPOSE, AS THE MAIN INTENT WAS TO PROVIDE HYPOTHETICAL CONSTRUCTS THAT COULD GUIDE FURTHER CONFIRMATORY/EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AS WELL AS FOR OTHER BUILDING TYPES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - A SUCCINCT AND EASY-TO-FOLLOW MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AS IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAY FOR OPERATIONALISING THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY IN THE INDUSTRY. THE MODEL HIGHLIGHTS THE OWNER-ARCHITECT-CONTRACTOR INFLUENCE TRIANGLE (OACIT) AS THE 20 PER CENT OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT COULD DELIVER 80 PER CENT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT IN THE RBLC. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY RE-EXAMINES PRODUCTIVITY ISSUES NOT ONLY FROM A LIFE-CYCLE PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE KEY ROLE-PLAYERS. IN ADDITION, THE OACIT CONCEPT OFFERS A NOVEL PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT TOOL; IT STRESSES THAT PRODUCTIVITY IN THE TRADITIONALLY PROCURED BUILDING LIFECYCLE COULD BE OPTIMISED IF THE ARCHITECT COULD FOCUS GREATER ATTENTION ON BRIEF ARTICULATION AND THE ISSUANCE AND REVIEW OF DESIGN AND SPECIFICATION INFORMATION. ALSO, THE OWNER SHOULD ADOPT PRODUCTIVITY-ENHANCING PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACT STRATEGIES AND EMPHASISE MORE ON VALUE-ADDITION AND LESS ON LOWEST TENDER PRICE.","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","MASSEY UNIVERSITY; MASSEY UNIVERSITY",NA,"J.I.MBACHU@MASSEY.AC.NZ",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1108/JEDT-02-2017-0014","FD3PB",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1726-0531","J.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOLUTIONS OF A MORE SUSTAINABLE NATURE TO REDUCE AND MITIGATE THIS SITUATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY URGENT. TO THIS END, THE INTEGRATION OF MULTI-DIMENSION AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT INTO THE DESIGN PROCESS OF BUILDINGS CAN HELP AND SUPPORT DECISION MAKING. LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA) IS ONE OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY'S MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED METHODOLOGIES FOR THIS PURPOSE, COMBINING THE EVALUATION OF THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS (TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE). ONE OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO IMPLEMENTING THIS METHODOLOGY LIES IN THE DIFFICULTIES IN AUTOMATICALLY COMPARING ALTERNATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS FOR THE SELECTION OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS. TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED THE BIM3LCA (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING THREE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT) TOOL CONCEIVED TO GUIDE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STEPS. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES A BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) PLUG-IN DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATES ITS APPLICATION IN A CASE STUDY TO SUPPORT THE MULTI-CRITERIA BUILDING MATERIAL SELECTION BASED ON THE LCSA IMPLEMENTATION AT THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE. THREE BUILDING MATERIAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM OF A MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING ARE EMPLOYED TO VALIDATE THIS PLUG-IN. THE RESULTS SHOW THE VIABILITY OF USING THIS TOOL DURING THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES AND DEMONSTRATES THE CONSISTENCY OF THE RESULTS REGARDING THE USE OF THE BIM MODEL TO CONDUCT THE LCSA. THE STUDY DISCUSSES THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE BIM3LCA TOOL.

PREVIOUS STUDIES ASSESSED MAINLY ENERGY AND CARBON, OR A SPECIFIC LIFE CYCLE STAGE. HOWEVER, INCREASED OPERATIONAL ENERGY CAN COMPROMISE THE LOWER EMBODIED IMPACTS OF LIGHTWEIGHT PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS, SO A COMPREHENSIVE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSED A LIGHTWEIGHT PREFABRICATED HOUSE FOR SEVEN HOUSE LOCATIONS (ADDRESSING TRANSPORT, CLIMATE, AND ELECTRICITY MIX), THREE INSULATION LEVELS, AND TWO HEAT PUMPS. A LIFE CYCLE MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR A PREFABRICATED ONE-BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A STEEL STRUCTURE, ADDRESSING MATERIALS, TRANSPORT TO PLANT, MODULAR PREFABRICATION, TRANSPORT TO SITE, ONSITE ASSEMBLAGE, AND USE STAGE. A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL (BIM) WAS INTEGRATED WITH THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL TO OBTAIN THE BILL OF MATERIALS, PERFORM THE ENERGY SIMULATION, AND BUILD THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY. THIS COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT INCLUDES ABIOTIC RESOURCE DEPLETION, ABIOTIC DEPLETION OF FOSSIL FUELS, GLOBAL WARMING, OZONE LAYER DEPLETION, PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION, ACIDIFICATION, EUTROPHICATION, AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY CATEGORIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT EMBODIED IMPACTS FOR THE MEDITERRANEAN AND TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SIGNIFICANT (UP TO 60\%) FOR MOST IMPACT CATEGORIES. PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT INSULATION LEVELS: LOW LEVEL IN A TROPICAL CLIMATE, MEDIUM LEVEL IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, AND HIGH LEVEL IN THE EU CONTINENTAL REGION.

THE ASSESSMENT COVERS ALL PHASES OVER THE LIFE SPAN OF THE BUILDING FROM MATERIAL PRODUCTION, CONSTRUCTION, USE, AND THE END OF BUILDING LIFE, IN ADDITION TO LOADS AND BENEFITS FROM REUSE/RECYCLING AFTER BUILDING DISPOSAL. THE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INDICATORS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE ATHENA IMPACT ESTIMATOR FOR BUILDINGS. THE INPUT DATA RELATED TO THE BUILDING MATERIALS USED ARE EXTRACTED FROM A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL OF THE BUILDING WHILE THE OPERATING ENERGY IN THE USE PHASE IS CALCULATED USING AN ENERGY SIMULATION SOFTWARE. THE ATHENA IMPACT ESTIMATOR CALCULATES THE FOLLOWING MID-POINT ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES: GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL, HUMAN HEALTH POTENTIAL, OZONE DEPLETION POTENTIAL, SMOG POTENTIAL, EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL, PRIMARY AND NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY (PE) CONSUMPTION, AND FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE LCA ASSESSMENT WAS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF A UNIVERSITY BUILDING. RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY RELATED TO GWP AND PE WERE AS FOLLOWS. THE BUILDING FOUNDATIONS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 29\% OF THE EMBODIED GWP AND 20\% OF THE EMBODIED PE, WHILE THE CFS SKELETON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 30\% OF THE EMBODIED GWP AND 49\% OF THE EMBODIED PE.

AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS NEITHER SUCCEEDED IN RURAL ENERGY SUBSTITUTION NOR ACHIEVED OTHER SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS, ALTHOUGH AVAILABLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OTHERWISE. THE REASON BEHIND THIS DISPARITY LARGELY LIES IN INACCURATE ADOPTION OF THE OPERATIONAL CYCLE, I.E., THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL OPERATIONAL TIME OF THE BIOGAS DIGESTER WAS OFTEN OVERESTIMATED. PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, AN EIO-LCA MODEL USING THE CHINESE ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE OF 2007 WAS BUILT TO ESTIMATE CARBON-DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSION DURING THE LIFE CYCLE OF A TYPICAL 8 M(3) HOUSEHOLD BIOGAS DIGESTER AND THEIR SOURCES WITH REGARD TO ECONOMIC SECTORS. THE LIFE CYCLE OF A BIOGAS DIGESTER CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE STAGES: CONSTRUCTION (INCLUDING POND BUILDING AND PEN, TOILET AND STOVE ALTERATIONS), OPERATION (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE AND BIOGAS COMBUSTION) AND DISPOSAL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NET CO2 EMISSION OF A BIOGAS DIGESTER IS 1558.91 KG AFTER ONE YEAR OF OPERATION, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO AN ACTUAL CO2 EMISSION OF 2878.30 KG (OF WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS ARE 1558.90 AND 1319.40 KG, RESPECTIVELY) AND AN EMISSION REDUCTION BY FUEL SUBSTITUTION AND FERTILIZER CONSERVATION OF 1078.59 AND 240.80 KG, RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE, THE MODEL INDICATES THAT A BIOGAS DIGESTER SHOULD BE RUN FOR AT LEAST 2.77 YEARS TO HAVE A NET CO2 EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFIT. THE MODEL ALSO INDICATES THAT COMPREHENSIVE UTILIZATION OF BIOGAS AND ITS BYPRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CARBON EMISSION IN RURAL AREAS. MOST OF THE INDIRECT EMISSIONS WERE DERIVED FROM CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, ACCOUNTING FOR 88.18\%. MOREOVER, THE SMELTING AND PRESSING OF FERROUS METALS IN THE 43-STEP PRODUCTION CHAIN OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS ACCOUNTED FOR 22.48\% OF THE INDIRECT EMISSIONS. THIS GIVES US A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE TO DEVELOP EMISSION REDUCTION POLICIES. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION FOR POLICY-MAKING ON BIOGAS PROMOTION AND MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL CHINA.

EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA), STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM), AND LITERATURE RESEARCH ARE THE THREE PHASES OF THE STUDY'S METHODOLOGY. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN PAKISTAN'S RAWALPINDI AND ISLAMABAD REGION UTILIZING A QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUE. THE POLL OF 159 PARTICIPANTS PRODUCED INTRIGUING FINDINGS. THE PROCESS OF EFA SERVES TO VERIFY CONSTRUCTS AND QUESTIONS, ENSURING THEIR RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY.

THE APPROPRIATE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TECHNOLOGIES BRINGS SEVERAL BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF PROJECT EFFICIENCY EMERGE IN THE FORM OF NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE WASTE IN THE PROCESSES. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A PRACTICAL PROCESS MODEL TO PLAN THE INFORMATION FLOW FOR BIM-BASED PROJECTS. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROPOSE A MODEL TO PLAN THE FLOW OF PROJECT INFORMATION AMONG PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR MAIN FINDINGS ARE FIRSTLY, THE FOUNDATION FOR DATA MANAGEMENT STARTS FROM DEFINING UNIFIED ONE DATA FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FOR THE PROCESS. UNIFIED DATA MEANS ONE SINGLE REPOSITORY OF DATA - ALL STAKEHOLDERS USE THE SAME UNIFIED DATA. IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT DATA RESPONSIBILITIES AND OWNERSHIP ARE DEFINED. SECONDLY, WE FOUND THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE THAT THE DATA NEEDS ARE NOT PLANNED BEFOREHAND, RESISTANCE TO CHANGE, DIFFICULTY RECEIVING EXISTING DATA AND DATA MUST BE MODIFIED BEFORE USE. AS A WHOLE, IT SEEMS SOMETIMES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ON DATA TRANSFER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT WHAT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED AND WHY.

THE CURRENT STUDY ALSO PROVIDES A PRETEXT FOR SUBSEQUENT ANALYSES WITH INFERENTIAL STATISTICS. NINE BUILDING ENVELOPE COMBINATIONS WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO FIVE SERVICE LIFE MODELS (N = 45, 45 DATA POINTS). THREE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DATA: GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP), ATMOSPHERIC ECO-TOXICITY (ECO), AND ATMOSPHERIC ACIDIFICATION (ACID) FROM THE TOOL FOR THE REDUCTION AND ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICAL AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (TRACI) ASSESSMENT METHOD. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS MEASURED MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, SKEWNESS, AND KURTOSIS. FOR THE FACTOR ANALYSIS, DATA WERE DISAGGREGATED ACCORDING TO NINE VARIABLES, INCLUDING CUMULATIVE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPLACEMENT (FREQUENCY), MINOR REPLACEMENT, MAJOR REPAIRS, MINOR REPAIRS, INSPECTIONS 1 AND 2, AND TOTAL TRANSPORTATION (N = 45, 405 DATA POINTS). ALL STATISTICAL OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS SOFTWARE. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS SHOW A RELATIVELY NORMAL DATA DISTRIBUTION FOR GWP. DATA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR ECO AND ACID DEVIATED SLIGHTLY FROM NORMAL, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH SHAPIRO-WILK AND KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TESTS.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF THE INITIAL AND RECURRENT EMBODIED EMISSIONS, OPERATING AND REUSE/DISPOSAL EMISSIONS, AND UTILIZING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) FOR A MORE HOLISTIC LIFE CYCLE APPROACH. THE RESEARCH PROPOSES A PARAMETRIC BIM-BASED LCA FRAMEWORK FOR QUANTIFYING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF MATERIAL SELECTION FOR BOTH EMBODIED AND OPERATING EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION, IT CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENT REUSE SCENARIOS AND PERCENTAGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON BOTH THE EMBODIED AND OPERATING IMPACTS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF FIVE MAIN MODULES: DATA ACQUISITION MODULE, OPERATING AND EMBODIED EMISSIONS MODULE, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODULE, OPTIMIZATION MODULE, AND DECISION-MAKING MODULE. THIS PARAMETRIC ASSESSMENT CAN BE APPLIED FOR BOTH THE CONVENTIONAL AND CIRCULAR APPROACH IMPACTS. FOR THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, THE RESULTING EMISSIONS ARE OPTIMIZED UTILIZING THE NON-DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II (NSGA-II) AND EVALUATED THROUGH AN LCA AND DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) METHODOLOGY FOR THE MATERIAL SELECTION. A CASE STUDY OF A RESIDENTIAL VILLA IN CAIRO IS WORKED OUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. THIS ASSESSMENT ANALYZES THE BUILDING MATERIALS' CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFICIENCY INVESTIGATING THE EXTERNAL WALLS, INTERNAL WALLS, FLOORS, ROOFS, AND WINDOWS DESIGN POSSIBILITIES, AND USES VISUAL PROGRAMMING TO CONTROL THE RESULTING EMISSIONS FOR A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH.

HOWEVER, IT DEVELOPS LOWER OPERATING GWP WITH BETTER APPLIED U-VALUES. THE CIRCULARITY APPROACH EMPLOYMENT HAS REDUCED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OPERATING GWP DUE TO UTILIZING MATERIALS WITH HIGH HEAT TRANSMITTANCE ABILITY.","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CAIRO; EGYPTIAN KNOWLEDGE BANK (EKB); CAIRO UNIVERSITY","106898","MMARZOUK@CU.EDU.EG",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106898","L3AP6","2352-7102","MAY 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"J.

THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE AIM OF THE STUDY, BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) WITH THE INTEGRATION OF LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS (LCCA) IS ADOPTED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING ENVELOPE AND OPTIMISE ENERGY USE AND RELEVANT COSTS. THREE ALTERNATIVES OF WALL SYSTEM: BRICK WALL WITH ROCKWOOL INSULATION, BRICK WALL WITH POLYSTYRENE INSULATION AND CURTAIN WALLS SYSTEM, ARE CONSIDERED FOR THE BUILDING ENVELOPE TO ENHANCE ENERGY-SAVING POTENTIAL BY ANALYSING AND COMPARING THE ENERGY DEMAND. TO DETERMINE LCCA, THE NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) APPROACH WAS ADOPTED FOR THE INITIAL EXPENDITURE AND THE ASSOCIATED FUTURE COSTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT UTILISING INSULATION MATERIAL WITH LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY REDUCES HEATING AND COOLING ENERGY RESULTING OPTIMISED LCC. COMPARED TO CURTAIN WALLS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ROCKWOOL INSULATED WALL REDUCES 17\% OF ENERGY DEMAND WHILE THE POLYSTYRENE WALL REDUCES 12.7\% OF THE ENERGY. SIMILARLY, ROCKWOOL INSULATED WALLS SAVE 5\% ENERGY RELATIVE TO THE WALL SYSTEM WITH POLYSTYRENE INSULATION. THUS, INTEGRATING LCCA WITH THE BIM APPROACH AT THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN STAGES PROMOTES ENERGY AND LCC OPTIMISATION.","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS; DEAKIN UNIVERSITY; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI PETRONAS",NA,"WESAM.ALALOUL@UTP.EDU.MY",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s10668-023-03001-w","JB6L3","1573-2975","FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1387-585X","ENVIRON.

SMART AIRPORTS UTILIZE NEW CONNECTED TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE END-USER EXPERIENCE WHILE ENSURING OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY IN AERONAUTICAL AND NON-AERONAUTICAL SEGMENTS. THE INCREASING NEED FOR DIGITIZING THE DESIGN-BUILD-OPERATE LIFE CYCLES OF AIRPORTS CAN BE MET BY IMPLEMENTING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) THAT ENABLES ACCESSING, MANAGING, UTILIZING, AND CONNECTING PHYSICAL AND OPERATIONAL DATA IN A DIGITAL COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT STATE OF PRACTICE IN AIRPORT BIM (ABIM) AND THE USE OF ABIM PROCESSES IN DIGITAL AIRPORT OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BY CONNECTING EXISTING DATA SOURCES AND INTEGRATING SMART AIRPORT SYSTEMS. THE STUDY PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE AND ADAPTIVE ABIM MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT DEPICTS THE ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTIVITY OF ABIM PROCESSES, RESOURCES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH AIRPORT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BY IDENTIFYING GAPS IN THE INDUSTRY AND LITERATURE, AND DEVELOPING A GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING IN ABIM VISIONS.

MIXED METHODS INCLUDING NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE ELEMENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK. MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (MBSE) PRINCIPLES AND LANGUAGE ARE USED TO GENERATE THE FRAMEWORK. FOR FRAMEWORK VALIDATION, A PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC) IS CONDUCTED BY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A WEB-BASED APPLICATION.

THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES AN AUTOMATED DESIGN PROCEDURE FORMULATED AS A CONSTRAINED SINGLE-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM TO ACHIEVE THE MINIMUM LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) WITHIN THE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PSO) ALGORITHM AND CAN BE THE BASIS OF CURRENT SEISMIC CODES FOR TARGET SAFETY CALIBRATION. LCC INCLUDES INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST AND LIFETIME SEISMIC LOSSES SUCH AS REPAIR COST, REPAIR TIME, AND CASUALTIES. FEMA P-58 METHODOLOGY IS EMPLOYED FOR THE LCC ANALYSIS OF THE BUILDING UNDER POSSIBLE EARTHQUAKES DURING ITS LIFETIME, WHICH IS ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTIES IN THE HAZARD-RESPONSE-DAMAGE-LOSS RELATIONSHIP. AN APPROPRIATE COST MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE INITIAL AND REPAIR COST OF THE STUDIED BRBS. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF ASCE AND AISC CODES ARE CONSIDERED AS DESIGN CONSTRAINTS. NONLINEAR RESPONSE HISTORY ANALYSIS THROUGH THE ENDURANCE TIME (ET) METHOD IS UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE THE STRUCTURAL RESPONSES VERSUS SEISMIC INTENSITY. THREE 4-, 8-, AND 12-STORY STEEL BUILDINGS WITH DUAL SEISMIC FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEM CONSISTING OF SMRF AND BRB (CALLED STEEL SMRF-BRB) ARE SELECTED AS THE CASE STUDY. EACH BUILDING IS OPTIMALLY DESIGNED WITH TWO APPROACHES: (1) LCC-BASED DESIGN WITHIN THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK AND (2) CODE-BASED DESIGN TO MINIMIZE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST. COMPARISON OF OPTIMIZED BUILDINGS WITH THE TWO DESIGN APPROACHES IN TERMS OF STRUCTURAL RESPONSES AND SEISMIC CONSEQUENCES DEMONSTRATES THAT FULFILLING THE MINIMUM CODE REQUIREMENTS AT A GIVEN SEISMIC HAZARD LEVEL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MINIMIZE LIFETIME SEISMIC LOSSES OF STEEL SMRF-BRBS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE OPTIMAL DESIGNS OBTAINED FROM THE CODE-BASED APPROACH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DAMAGE CONCENTRATION, IRREPARABILITY, AND HIGH COLLAPSE PROBABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN SEISMIC EVENTS MORE SEVERE THAN THE DESIGN LEVEL.

SPECIFICALLY, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS GENERATED BY A MONOFUNCTIONAL BIM TO PLAN ROAD MAINTENANCE - A PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PMS) -ARE EVALUATED USING FIELD DATA FROM FRANCE. THE RELATED CARBON FOOTPRINTS ARE CALCULATED FOLLOWING A LIFE CYCLE APPROACH, USING DIFFERENT SOURCES OF DATA - INCLUDING ECOINVENT V3.6 - AND THE IPCC 2013 GWP 100A CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS. THREE DESIGN-BUILD-MAINTAIN PAVEMENT ALTERNATIVES ARE COMPARED: SCENARIO 1 RELATES TO A MASSIVE DESIGN AND SURFACE MAINTENANCE, SCENARIO 2 TO A PROGRESSIVE DESIGN AND PRE-PLANNED STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE, AND SCENARIO 3 TO A PROGRESSIVE DESIGN AND TAILORED STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE SUPPORTED BY THE PMS. FIRST, RESULTS SHOW THE NEGLIGIBLE DIRECT EMISSIONS DUE TO THE PMS EXISTENCE - 0.02\% OF THE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS OF SCENARIO 3'S PAVEMENT, E.G. 0.52 T CO2EQ FOR 10 KM AND 30 YEARS. SECOND, THE BASE CASE AND TWO COMPLEMENTARY SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE USE OF A PMS IS CLIMATE-POSITIVE OVER THE LIFE CYCLE WHEN PAVEMENT SUBGRADE BEARING CAPACITY IMPROVES OVER TIME, NEUTRAL FOR THE CLIMATE OTHERWISE. THE GHG EMISSIONS SAVINGS USING BIM CAN REACH UP TO 14 AND 30\% OF THE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO SCENARIO 2 AND 1, AND RESP. 47 AND 65\% WHEN RESTRAINING THE SCOPE TO MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION AND EXCLUDING ORIGINAL PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION.

INEXPERIENCED OWNERS OR STAKEHOLDERS HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INITIAL COST AND LCC, AND THEREFORE TYPICALLY CHOOSE THE INITIAL VALUE, WHICH SEEMS ECONOMICAL FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER, HOWEVER, WAS TO CREATE A BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE THAT HELPS OWNERS, STAKEHOLDERS, OR STUDENTS VISUALIZE AND QUICKLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LCC AND INITIAL COST. TO THIS END, THE AUTHORS CREATE A BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE THAT INTEGRATES BIM WITH A GAME ENGINE SIMULATION ( I. E., UNITY 3D) INTO AN LCC ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION. THE BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE ALLOWS USERS TO NAVIGATE THEIR BUILDING ENVIRONMENTS WITH THE CAPABILITY OF SIMULATING THE LCC. THE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE A COMBINATION FROM AMONG MANY FIELDS INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, AND GAME DEVELOPMENT. THESE ELEMENTS CONNECT VARIOUS AREAS SUCH AS BUILDING MODELING, ANIMATION, NAVIGATION, AND COLLISION DETECTION. CHANGING THE MATERIALS AND ADDING CONSTRUCTION ACCESSORIES SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVED THE LCC AND THE INTERACTION OF GAME ENGINE CONTROLLERS AND THE PLAYER'S INTERFACE. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED A SURVEY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BIM-GAME PROTOTYPE.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A BIMCENTERED METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO A REAL-WORLD HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY LINE (HSRL) PROJECT. THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF HSRL DESIGN PARAMETERS AND THE INTEGRATION OF VARIOUS BIM-BASED TOOLS, A 3D PARAMETRIC DESIGN MODEL IS GENERATED.

THROUGH CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CURRENT LCA IS NOT YET WELL-ADAPTED TO ASSESS THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OF BUILDING MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS. IT IS SHOWN THAT CURRENT INVENTORY DATA AND MODELS ARE INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE UPTAKE AND EMISSION OF CHEMICALS DURING USE, THE MIGRATION OF CHEMICALS WITHIN THE VALUE CHAIN ACROSS THE MULTIPLE PHASES IN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY, AND BECAUSE CURRENT CHARACTERIZATION MODELS LACK A LARGE FRACTION OF THE POTENTIALLY EMITTED CHEMICALS FROM SAID UPTAKE AND EMISSION IDENTIFIED IN THE TESTED BUILDING MATERIAL SAMPLES.

OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE TRANSPORT WORLDWIDE IS CARRIED BY SHIPS. AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008 THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY EXPERIENCED TURBULENCES WHICH HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE VOLUME OF TRADE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS AN OVERCAPACITY OF SHIPS CRUISING ON THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD. MANY OF THE OLDER SHIPS WERE DECOMMISSIONED AND SCRAPPED. NUMEROUS SCRAPYARDS ARE IN SOUTH ASIA, WHERE THE SHIPS ARE DISMANTLED UNDER HARSH WORKING CONDITIONS AND WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. A LOT OF THESE SCRAP YARDS ARE MERELY BEACHES WHERE THE SHIPS ARE BEACHED (BEACH-BREAKING YARDS) AND DISASSEMBLED MANUALLY. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND EFFORTS EXIST TO TACKLE THIS KIND OF END-OF-LIFE TREATMENT OF SHIPS WHICH IS DANGEROUS FOR HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE BASEL CONVENTION TO CONTROL HAZARDOUS WASTE, TO WHICH DISPOSED SHIPS ALSO BELONG. IN 2009 THE HONG KONG CONVENTION WAS ADOPTED, WHICH AIMS AT REDUCING THE RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT DURING THE RECYCLING OF SHIPS. JUST RECENTLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THE EU SHIP RECYCLING REGULATION TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS LINKED TO THE RECYCLING OF EU-FLAGGED SHIPS. THE REGULATION SETS OUT A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR EUROPEAN SHIPS, EUROPEAN SHIP OWNERS AND SHIP RECYCLING FACILITIES. CONFRONTING EXISTING CHALLENGES OF SHIP SCRAPPING AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES A LITERATURE RESEARCH IS PERFORMED TO ASSESS IN WHAT WAY THE END-OF-LIFE OF SHIPS HAS BEEN COVERED IN LCA STUDIES. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS AN OWN APPROACH TO AN END-OF-LIFE (EOL) ASSESSMENT IS SET UP AND ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMPLE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE EOL OF CARGO SHIPS, A SIMPLIFIED MODEL BASED ON THE MENTIONED PREEXISTING INFORMATION IS CREATED. ALL THREE PHASES: SHIP BUILDING, SHIP OPERATION AND SHIP SCRAPPING ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. TWO SCENARIO GROUPS FOR THE SHIP SCRAPPING WERE DEFINED, WITH DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO RE-USE AND RECYCLING. THE OVERALL CONTRIBUTION OF THE END-OF-LIFE PHASE TO THE LIFE CYCLE (CONSTRUCTION OF THE SHIP, USE, EOL) OF A SHIP IS RANGED AND EVALUATED. THE RESULTS OF THE ASSESSED SCENARIOS CONFIRM THAT THE RE-USE AND RECYCLING PROCESS IS ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE. HOWEVER, THE PROCESSES AND HUMAN LABOUR HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YET. THE OVERALL IMPACT ON THE LIFECYCLE REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE WITHIN THE ASSESSED IMPACT CATEGORIES. A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE EOL ON THE LIFECYCLE MIGHT BE SEEN IF OTHER IMPACT CATEGORIES, SUCH AS INDICATORS FOR RESOURCE EFFICIENCY ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.","17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE","UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART","101","NATHANAEL.KO@LBP.UNI-STUTTGART.DE",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1051/mattech/2015002","DG6HP","1778-3771",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-6895","MATER.

SEVERAL FRAMEWORKS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE TO CALCULATE THE FOOTPRINT OF BUILDINGS, INCLUDING STANDARDS AND NORMS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), AND DEDICATED SOFTWARE TOOLS. THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PROGRAMME FOR THESE CALCULATIONS IS BOTH SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED AND VERY PRACTICAL. THIS SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION FOCUSES ON THE APPLICATION OF A BIM-BASED RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO ANALYSE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE. THE RESEARCH PROCESS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING STEPS: (I) THE DESIGN OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE WITH MASONRY CONSTRUCTION USING ARCHICAD 26, BIM PROGRAMME, (II) SIMULATION OF THE BUILDING ENERGY PERFORMANCE USING THE ECODESIGNER STAR PLUG-IN, (III) LCA USING THE PLUG-IN FOR ARCHICAD, (IV) PREPARATION OF A SECOND MODEL WITH TIMBER-FRAME CONSTRUCTION FOR COMPARISON, AND (V) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE MODELS WITH MASONRY CONSTRUCTION (BUILDING A) AND TIMBER-FRAME (BUILDING B). ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CO2E EMISSIONS BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND THE VARYING IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS ON THE TOTAL CO2E EMISSIONS OF THE BUILDINGS STUDIED. BUILDING A HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NET EMISSIONS, AMOUNTING TO 43,226.94 KG CO2E, IN STARK CONTRAST TO BUILDING B'S SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER 13,522.13 KG CO2E. THIS DISCREPANCY WAS ALSO MIRRORED IN THE EMISSION INTENSITY, WITH BUILDING A EMITTING AT A RATE OF 281.06 KG CO2E/M2 COMPARED TO BUILDING B'S 96.72 KG CO2E/M2.

AS A RESULT, LIFE CYCLE MODELS ARE OFTEN DEVELOPED IN AN AD HOC MANNER, AND ARE DIFFICULT TO COMPARE. SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS MAY BE INADVERTENTLY LEFT OUT. OVERCOMING THIS SHORTCOMING CAN HELP ELICIT GREATER CONFIDENCE IN LIFE CYCLE MODELS AND THEIR USE FOR DECISION MAKING. METHODS THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A FRAMEWORK FOR HYBRID LIFE CYCLE MODEL GENERATION BY SELECTING ACTIVITIES BASED ON THEIR IMPORTANCE, PARAMETRIC UNCERTAINTY, AND CONTRIBUTION TO NETWORK COMPLEXITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTIVITIES IS DETERMINED BY STRUCTURAL PATH ANALYSIS-WHICH THEN GUIDES THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIFE CYCLE MODELS BASED ON UNCERTAINTY AND COMPLEXITY INDICATORS. INFORMATION ABOUT UNCERTAINTY IS FROM THE AVAILABLE LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY; COMPLEXITY IS QUANTIFIED BY COST OR GRANULARITY. THE LIFE CYCLE MODEL IS DEVELOPED IN A HIERARCHICAL MANNER BY ADDING THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES UNTIL ERROR REQUIREMENTS ARE SATISFIED OR NETWORK COMPLEXITY EXCEEDS USER-SPECIFIED CONSTRAINTS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE FOR BUILDING A HYBRID LCA MODEL. SINCE THIS IS A CONSTRUCTED EXAMPLE, THE RESULTS CAN BE COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL IMPACT, TO VALIDATE THE APPROACH. THIS APPLICATION DEMONSTRATES HOW THE ALGORITHM SEQUENTIALLY DEVELOPS A LIFE CYCLE MODEL OF ACCEPTABLE UNCERTAINTY AND NETWORK COMPLEXITY. CHALLENGES IN APPLYING THIS FRAMEWORK TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED. CONCLUSION THE PRESENTED ALGORITHM DESIGNS SYSTEM BOUNDARIES BETWEEN SCALES OF HYBRID LCA MODELS, INCLUDES OR OMITS ACTIVITIES FROM THE SYSTEM BASED ON PATH ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CONTRIBUTION AT UPSTREAM NETWORK NODES, AND PROVIDES MODEL QUALITY INDICATORS THAT PERMIT COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT LCA MODELS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF OHIO; OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"BAKSHI.2@OSU.EDU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-020-01826-5","OP2HP","1614-7502","OCT 2020",NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [CBET-1804943]; SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","PARTIAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT WAS PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (CBET-1804943) AND THE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY PROGRAM AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS (LCCA), WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT IN SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT, IS A PRINCIPAL TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY FOR THE TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE BUDGET OF A BUILDING PROJECT. LCCA IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS DUE TO REPETITIVE COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS, WHICH ARE BASED ON VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO REQUIRES A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE. FOR CONVENTIONAL DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, DATA ARE USUALLY STORED IN THE FORM OF PAPERS AND ARE INPUT INTO THE SYSTEMS MANUALLY. THIS RESULTS IN DATA LOSS AND INCONSISTENT DATA, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CONTRIBUTE TO INACCURATE LIFE-CYCLE COSTS (LCCS). BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) IS A MODERN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAN POTENTIALLY OVERCOME THE ASPERITIES OF THE CONVENTIONAL BUILDING LCCA. HOWEVER, EXISTING BIM TOOLS CANNOT CARRY OUT BUILDING LCCA DUE TO THEIR LIMITED CAPABILITIES.

THE SYSTEM INTEGRATES THE BIM AUTHORING PROGRAM, THE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, THE SPREADSHEET SYSTEM, AND THE VISUAL PROGRAMMING INTERFACE.

THE NEW APPROACH, ALSO KNOWN AS THE RESOURCE LOOP, HAS THE CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE BOTH C2G AND C2C LIFECYCLES OF MOST PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR POLICIES. THE C2C LCA MODEL REPRESENTS THE FOOTPRINT OF A PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY THAT NEVER ENDS (I.E., RECYCLED OR REUSED). IT REFLECTS THE FOOTPRINT OF A PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY THAT TERMINATES AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE (I.E., DISPOSED OR LANDFILLED). IN THIS PAPER, MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOW ANALYSIS (MEFA) IS INTEGRATED INTO THE C2C LCA MODEL TO ENHANCE THE MODEL'S CAPABILITY TO CAPTURE AND INTEGRATE MATERIAL AND ENERGY INFORMATION INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OF LCA. THE FLOWS ARE RELABELED ``LEAKS'' AND ``FEEDS'' OF WHICH THE MATERIAL AND ENERGY COULD LEAK OUT OF OR FEED INTO THE LIFE CYCLE SYSTEM. THE ``LEAKS'' AND ``FEEDS'' REFLECT THE FLOWS OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY IN AND OUT OF THE LIFE CYCLE PROCESS. THEY CAN ALSO BE INTEGRATED WITH THE LIFE CYCLES OF OTHER PRODUCT, PROCESS OR POLICY. SUCH INTEGRATION IS A STEP CLOSER TOWARD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LCA MODEL FOR A FINISHED PRODUCT THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOWS (E.G., A BUILDING). RESOURCE LOOP (RL) REFLECTS THE MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOWS AND LOOPS OF ONE OR MORE COMPLEX SYSTEMS MORE ACCURATELY.

THE CURRENT WORK PRESENTS A COMPLETE APPROACH FOR CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSESSMENT INCLUDING PLANNING, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATIONAL, MAINTENANCE AND DISMANTLING \& DISPOSE-OFF PHASE. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) WITH BOUNDARY LIMITATIONS OF `CRADLE TO GRAVE' WAS ADOPTED. THIRTEEN HOUSING UNITS WERE SELECTED AS CASE STUDY. THESE INCLUDED DETACHED, SEMI-DETACHED AND TERRACED TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION. SELECTED UNITS WERE DEVELOPED IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM). THE STUDY OBSERVED THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION RANGE FROM 1.48 TONS-CO2/YR TO 2.85 TONS-CO2/YR. ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE EXECUTION PHASE DOMINATED THE FIVE PHASES WITH ALMOST 43 \%.

MATERIAL FLOW ANALYSIS (MFA) CAN BRING TO CLCA MODELLING MORE REPRESENTATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION THAN THE COMMONLY USED HYPOTHESIS IN CONSEQUENTIAL MODELLING. INDEED, MFA CONSIDERS PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS (TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCES AND MATERIAL AVAILABILITY), IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNT FOR MASS BALANCE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW SUCH CONSISTENCY IS ADDED TO CLCA THROUGH AN MFA OF WOOD PRODUCTS IN NON-RESIDENTIAL (NR) BUILDINGS IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA).

AFTERWARD COSTS IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE LACK CONSIDERATION, WHICH IS MAINLY CONSTRAINED BY DATA AVAILABILITY AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE RIGID PIPE AND EVALUATES THE COMPARABLE APPLICATION OF REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE (RCP), NON-REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE (NRCP), AND VITRIFIED CLAY PIPE (VCP) IN SEWER SYSTEMS. THE LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED THROUGHOUT THE MATERIAL MANUFACTURING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE PHASES. PARTICULARLY, THE MARKOV CHAIN MODEL IS USED TO PREDICT SYSTEMS' CONDITIONS THAT ARE USED AS A GUIDANCE FOR MANAGEMENT IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE. UNDER A GIVEN STRATEGY, THE COST ESTIMATE IS EXTENDED TO THE STEADY STATE, PROVIDING A NEW COST COMPARISON PERSPECTIVE. IN ADDITION, METHODS TO EVALUATE THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY ARE ALSO PRESENTED. APPLYING THE BOOTSTRAPPING APPROACH, THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE MARKOV CHAINS MODEL DEMONSTRATES DECENT ROBUSTNESS. IN THE CASE STUDY OF A 24-IN. PIPE APPLICATION, RESULTS SHOW THAT NRCP DEMANDS THE LEAST INITIAL BUILDING COST, WHILE RCP IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE CONSIDERING LONGER SERVICE LIFE TIME. COST COMPARISON AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE ALSO PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.

THE CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK DEFINES A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF SKILL BUILDING BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS THAT CAN SPEED LEARNING FOR COMPANIES WITH LESS MATURE PROGRAMS. BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREMENTALLY EXPAND THE SPAN OF CONCERN FROM COMPANY OBJECTIVES, TO VALUE CHAIN VIABILITY, AND ULTIMATELY TO SOCIETAL NEEDS, WHILE BROADENING THE BASE OF INFORMATION AND ENGAGING A WIDER SET OF STAKEHOLDER VIEWS. THE UNEP/SETAC SPONSORED PILOT TESTS OF THE LCM CMM IN CAMEROON, UGANDA, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, AND PERU.

THE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO APPLY THE CONCEPTS TO DEVELOP ACCURATE, REPRESENTATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL MATURITY AND TO IDENTIFY REASONABLE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT DELIVERED SOME FINANCIAL VALUE IN THE SHORT TERM, ADDRESSED A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM GAP IDENTIFIED IN THE MATURITY ASSESSMENT, AND COULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE SCHEDULE DEADLINE OF THE CONTRACT (6 TO 9 MONTHS). THE PROJECTS INCLUDED AN LCA OF CLEANING PRODUCTS, COLLABORATION AMONG THREE COMPANIES TO FIND A BETTER SOLUTION FOR MANAGING A WASTE STREAM OF COFFEE ``SILVER SKINS,'' A STREAMLINED ASSESSMENT OF ACRYLIC PRODUCTS, AN LCA OF DISPOSABLE POLYPROPYLENE (PP) AND POLYSTYRENE (PS) CUPS, AND A QUALITATIVE SCREENING OF OPERATIONS OF A TRANSIT COMPANY. THE PAPER DISCUSSES HOW THE RESULTS OF THE STUDIES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF EACH COMPANY. THE PILOT PROJECTS SHOWED THAT THE CAPABILITY MATURITY APPROACH HAD INTUITIVE APPEAL AND THE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO APPLY THE CONCEPTS TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS WITH LIMITED TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WITH LC RELEVANCE. THIS SUGGESTS THERE SHOULD BE LESS EMPHASIS ON LCA AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS AND MORE AS A METHOD TO GAIN INSIGHTS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS-RELEVANT PROJECTS.

THROUGH A CARBON EMISSIONS CALCULATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF REPLACING PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS ON A LARGE PUBLIC BUILDING IN ZHENJIANG, CHINA, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT AFTER REPLACING GLASS CURTAIN WALLS WITH PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS, THE CARBON EMISSIONS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATION STAGE DECREASED BY 30.74\%, BUT THE CARBON EMISSIONS DURING THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION STAGE OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED BY 10.48\%. THE CARBON EMISSIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF THE BUILDING HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY 20.99\%. THIS INDICATES THAT PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALL TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE BUILDING CARBON EMISSIONS. FURTHER PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND SALES ROUTES FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC CURTAIN WALLS AND ACCELERATING THE IMPROVEMENT OF CARBON TRADING SYSTEMS CAN FURTHER IMPROVE THE CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION EFFECT OF BUILDINGS.

THE PROCEDURE ALLOWS THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE ECONOMIC GAIN ENABLED BY WIM SYSTEMS, USEFUL IN ASSESSING THE COST/ACCURACY TRADE-OFF FOR A GIVEN WIM SYSTEM. IT IS FOUND THAT THE CONTINUOUS USE OF A WIM SYSTEM MAY IMPROVE THE RATE OF DECREASE OF THE STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY INDEX, COMPARED WITH TEMPORALLY LIMITED USE OF WIM DATA. THE PERIODIC UPDATE OF THE RELIABILITY INDEX AND OF THE PROBABILITY OF FAILURE BASED ON WIM MEASUREMENTS RESULTS IN A RATHER ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF THE FATIGUE LIFE CYCLE COST, WHICH IS CRUCIAL IN IDENTIFYING THE PAYBACK TIME OF THE WIM SYSTEM.","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","UNIVERSITY OF PERUGIA; IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"ILARIA.VENANZI@UNIPG.IT",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1080/15732479.2021.2023589","L9FQ5","1744-8980","DEC 2021",NA,"``CASSA DI RISPARMIO DI PERUGIA'' FOUNDATION [2019.0338.029]","THE AUTHORS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE ``CASSA DI RISPARMIO DI PERUGIA'' FOUNDATION, THAT FUNDED THIS STUDY THROUGH THE PROJECT ``DEVELOPMENT OF AN ORIGINAL LIFE-CYCLE COST MODEL FOR THE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF BRIDGES AND VIADUCTS EQUIPPED WITH SHM SYSTEMS'' (GRANT NUMBER 2019.0338.029), AND THE SUPPORT OF BRENT PHARES AT IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION THAT PROVIDED THE FIELD MONITORING DATA.",NA,"1573-2479","STRUCT.

AFTERWARD, A RAPID COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON PARALLEL COMPUTING IS ADOPTED TO OBTAIN THE COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMAL DESIGN SCHEME FOR THE BUILDING TO BE RETROFITTED. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS APPLIED TO A KINDERGARTEN BUILDING RETROFIT CASE IN NANJING, CHINA, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPTIMAL COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS OF 34,158.3 KG, AN INCREASE IN THE THERMAL COMFORT PERIOD OF 2.7\%, AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN DAYLIGHTING COMFORT OF 79.7\% OVER THE BENCHMARK SCHEME. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY EXTENDS BEYOND ITS POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN KINDERGARTEN BUILDING RETROFITS. IT CONTRIBUTES TO ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE BUILDING DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, CREATING HEALTHIER AND MORE COMFORTABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CHILDREN WHILE MITIGATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS.

HOWEVER, EACH DESIGN SOLUTION HAS ITS OWN CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE BUILDING. THE USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) CAN BE PROFITABLY ADOPTED FOR SUPPORTING THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THIS PAPER REPORTS A COMPARATIVE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED TO ANALYSE THE IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS FOR TIMBER-BASED HIGH-RISE STRUCTURES. EMBODIED, OPERATIONAL, AND ENDOF-LIFE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BASED ON TWO STRUCTURAL FRAME TYPES, A REINFORCED CONCRETE (RC) STRUCTURE AND CROSS-LAMINATED TIMBER (CLT) ARE EXPLORED. TWO MAIN INPUTS ARE USED FOR PERFORMING A COMPREHENSIVE CRADLE-TOGRAVE LCA FOR THE WHOLE BUILDING: THE BILL OF QUANTITIES FROM A REVIT BIM MODEL AND THE ENERGY DEMAND FROM DESIGNSTUDIO. THEN, AN LCA IS PERFORMED USING THE ONE CLICK LCA TOOL FOR A SERVICE LIFE OF 50 YEARS AND 12 IMPACT CATEGORIES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS ARE BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS (EPDS) DIRECTLY EMBEDDED IN THE TOOL. THE METHOD IS THEN APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY IN AALBORG, DENMARK. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FOR THE CONSIDERED CASE STUDY ARE 9.6 KG- CO2 EQ./M2/Y FOR THE CLT STRUCTURE AGAINST 10.8 KG- CO2 EQ./M2/Y FOR THE RC STRUCTURE. THE PRODUCTION STAGE OF BUILDING MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUILDING SYSTEMS AND INSTALLATIONS, ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 55\% OF THE TOTAL EMISSIONS, WHILE ENERGY USE (B6 PHASE) DURING THE IN-USE STAGE OF THE BUILDING RECORDED A LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (45\%). THE OUTCOMES CONFIRM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BASE THE DISCUSSION ON ALTERNATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS ON MORE OBJECTIVE AND DATA-BASED ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS WHICH ALREADY INVOLVE A WIDE RANGE OF ARCHITECTURAL, FUNCTIONAL AND FINANCIAL CRITERIA. THIS IS OF GREAT RELEVANCE IN ACHIEVING BALANCED AND INFORMED DECISIONS WHICH DO NOT SIMPLY FOLLOW GREEN-LABELLED IDEAS BUT ARE GROUNDED ON EVIDENCE-BASED CONSIDERATIONS.","PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY PRAGUE; CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY PRAGUE; UNIVERSITY OF BOLOGNA","113557","LICIA.FELICIONI@CVUT.CZ JACOPO.GASPARI@UNIBO.IT JAKUB.VESELKA@CVUT.CZ ZDENKO.MALIK@CVUT.CZ",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113557","U4ST2","1872-6178","SEP 2023",NA,"CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE [1612307A124]; (UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS) [8941501V001]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE [GRANT NUMBER 1612307A124 (FACULTY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING) AND INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS 8941501V001 (UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS) ] .

THEREFORE, HOW TO CONSERVE THIS VALUABLE INFORMATION BECOMES A COMMON ISSUE FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE CONSERVATION IN THE WORLD. MANY RESEARCHES ABOUT CONSERVING THE INFORMATION OF WITHIN BUILT HERITAGES WERE DONE AND MORE ISSUES WERE RAISED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BUILT HERITAGE AND NEW BUILDING IS THAT BUILT HERITAGE IS NOT FROM 0 BUT IT IS ALREADY EXIST. THIS DIFFERENCE CAUSE A BIG DIFFERENT FOR MODELLING PROCESS OF BUILT HERITAGE IN BIM ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THE INFORMATION OF THE 3D MODEL OF BUILT HERITAGE IS ADDED TO THE MODEL AFTER THE IT WAS CREATED.

THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A BIM-BASED DWM SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO FACILITATE THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (LCSA) AND DECISION-MAKING BY INTEGRATING LCSA-RELATED PROPERTIES AND HYBRID MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-AIDING (MCDA) METHODS INTO A BIM ENVIRONMENT USING DYNAMO VISUAL SCRIPTING. A DYNAMIC LINKAGE IS DEVELOPED IN THE STREAMLINED BIM-BASED LCSA PROCESS, WHERE THE ENRICHED INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASS (IFC) MODELS ARE COUPLED WITH CUSTOM LCSA DATA TEMPLATES TO ACHIEVE SEAMLESS DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BIM PLATFORM AND EXTERNAL LCA TOOLS. SUBSEQUENTLY, HYBRID MCDA METHODS CONVERT THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS INTO DWM SCENARIO RANKING. A PILOT STUDY VERIFIES THE APPLICABILITY OF THE BIM-BASED FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS UNVEIL THAT THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE ASCENDED WITH THE RECYCLING RATE. THE OPTIMAL DWM ALTERNATIVE WITH THE HIGHEST RECYCLING RATE YIELDS THE HIGHEST SUSTAINABILITY SCORE AT 91.63. CONVERSELY, A DWM ALTERNATIVE REFLECTING THE `STATUS QUO' IN CHINA'S RECYCLING INDUSTRY HAS THE LOWEST SCORE AT 8.37, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE BASELINE SCENARIO WITH A 50\% RECYCLING RATE. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE `GROWTH CURVE' OF THE SUSTAINABILITY SCORE CONTINUOUSLY FLATTENS AS THE TARGET RECYCLING RATE ESCALATES.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE APPLICATION OF GREEN DESIGN CONCEPT IN ARCHITECTURE, PROMOTE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURE, AND REALIZE THE RATIONAL UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. FIRST, ACCORDING TO THE LIFE CYCLE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THEORIES, BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IS DIVIDED INTO THREE LEVELS: ECONOMY, ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIETY. SECOND, BASED ON THE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY, THE ECONOMIC EVALUATION MODEL, ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION MODEL, AND SOCIAL EVALUATION MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE ARE ESTABLISHED. MOREOVER, THE LIFE CYCLE COST, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION, AND SOCIAL IMPACT EVALUATION OF BUILDINGS AT DIFFERENT STAGES ARE ANALYZED TO REALIZE THE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY AND PROMOTE THE GREEN DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. THE RESULTS DENOTE THAT THE PRE-PROJECT COST ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOWEST PROPORTION IN THE SUSTAINABLE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDINGS WITHOUT DISCOUNT. THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COST IS THE HIGHEST, ACCOUNTING FOR 65.4\%. REGARDING NET PRESENT VALUE, THE PROJECT COST IS MAINLY INSTALLATION, OUTDOOR, ETC., WITH 61.5\%, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND DEMOLITION EXPENSES DECREASES. ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE, WORKERS' WELFARE GREATLY IMPACTS SOCIETY, AMONG WHICH FAIR SALARY, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL WELFARE HAVE AN IMPACT DEGREE OF 0.15, 0.175, AND 1.714, RESPECTIVELY. ECONOMICALLY, AFTER CONSIDERING THE DISCOUNT RATE, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE CAN SAVE COSTS MORE EFFECTIVELY. AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEVEL, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE.

BY ONLY APPLYING PASSIVE DESIGN STRATEGIES (NOT INCLUDING HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM TYPE), THE MODELS' ENERGY DEMAND WAS REDUCED UP TO 30\% OF THE ORIGINAL VALUE. IT IS ALSO WITNESSED THAT BY USING THE PROPER EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT MATCH THE RESPECTIVE CLIMATE, UP TO 28\% OF THE BUILDING'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE, CAN BE SAVED. ALTHOUGH INSULATION OF THE WALLS DOES REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION VALUES, IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

IN THIS OBJECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEND TO ORGANIZE WORK EXECUTION BY IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE, LINKED AND SEQUENTIAL PROCESSES, MAKING FULL USE OF EVERY WORK EFFORT AND LIMITING WORK DUPLICATION AND REWORK. SINCE THE `90S, THE 3D-MODELING IS USED TO COORDINATE, PLAN, BUILD AND MANAGE FUTURE STRUCTURES. THE BIM APPROACH PROPOSES TO STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTELLIGENT CENTRALLY SHARED 3D-MODEL MAKING USE OF EVERY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS MODEL, FACILITATING THE COORDINATION, SOLVING THE INTERFACES, REDUCING DUPLICATION EFFORTS AND CARRYING THE DEVELOPED DATA INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE STRUCTURE AND BEYOND THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. COMPLETING A COMPLEX STRUCTURE REQUIRES AN IMPORTANT LEVEL OF DESIGN MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN ARCHITECT, DESIGNER, MECHANIC, ELECTRICIAN, AND OTHER DESIGNERS.

HOWEVER, THE LCA PROCESS REQUIRES EXTENSIVE TIME AND EFFORT WHEN APPLIED TO SYSTEMS AS COMPLEX AS THE LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDINGS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) PLATFORMS OFFERS INTERESTING OPPORTUNITIES TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR DRAWING UP LCAS IN THE CASE OF BUILDINGS. RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE USE OF BIM-BASED METHODS LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TIME AND EFFORT WHICH PRACTITIONERS DEDICATE TO APPLYING THE LCA METHODOLOGY TO ENTIRE BUILDINGS. LCA PHASES SUCH AS LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY, TRADITIONALLY EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING, IS ALMOST SELF-OPERATING WHEN BIM RESOURCES ARE IN USE. THE LEVEL OF AUTOMATION OF LCA ELABORATION COULD BE OPTIMIZED BY USING A) THE PROGRAMMING POSSIBILITIES WITHIN THE BIM PLATFORM FRAMEWORK; AND B) THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE MODELS FOR ANALYSIS. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THESE TWO FIELDS, BASED ON A LINE OF RESEARCH PROPOSED BY THE MASTER'S IN INNOVATION IN ARCHITECTURE: TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLE. THERE HAS BEEN A CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE INTEGRATED IN BIM. MANY REGIONS HAVE ENCOURAGED COUNTRIES TO USE BIM PLATFORMS WHEN DOCUMENTING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. THIS NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE LIFE CYCLE OF NUMEROUS BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT, OBTAINING SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENCHMARKS FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES. THIS COMMUNICATION DESCRIBES A METHOD PROPOSED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENCHMARKS, - SUCH AS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND CUMULATIVE ENERGY DEMAND - FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DWELLINGS USING LCA METHODOLOGY AND BIM PLATFORMS. THE APPLICATION OF THIS APPROACH TO DIFFERENT CASE STUDIES IS PRESENTED. THE CASE STUDIES SELECTED FOR THIS RESEARCH ARE THOSE OF HOUSING LOCATED IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL AND CLIMATE CONTEXTS AND USING DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTIVE SYSTEMS (E.G. MASONRY CONSTRUCTION, WOOD CONSTRUCTION, STEEL CONSTRUCTION).

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF NEW BUILDINGS OR RENOVATING EXISTING BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, RENOVATING BUILDING ENVELOPES AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TO LESSEN ENERGY LOSSES IS USUALLY EXPENSIVE AND HAS A LONG PAYBACK PERIOD. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION OF THE RESEARCH ABOUT OPTIMIZING ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE RENOVATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS TO MINIMIZE THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING BUILDINGS BY SELECTING THE OPTIMAL RENOVATION STRATEGIES CONSIDERING LCA. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS CAN BE COMBINED IN A BUILDING RENOVATION STRATEGY TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. EACH SCENARIO CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVEMENT OF THE BUILDING ENVELOPES, HEATING, VENTILATION, AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) SYSTEMS, AND LOCAL ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE SCENARIOS COULD BE INCONSISTENT AND SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IN THIS RESEARCH IS THE APPROPRIATE COUPLING OF RENOVATION SCENARIOS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HVAC SYSTEM MUST BE REDESIGNED WHEN RENOVATING THE BUILDING ENVELOPE TO CONSIDER THE REDUCED ENERGY DEMAND AND TO AVOID UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS. A GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) COUPLED WITH AN ENERGY SIMULATION TOOL IS USED FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY MINIMIZING THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND THE LCA OF THE BUILDING. THE SIMULATION TOOL IS USED TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR EACH POTENTIAL SOLUTION REPRESENTING ONE RENOVATION SCENARIO.

THIS STRATEGY MEANS THAT NO LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED OVER THE DESIGN PROCESS. YET, WHILE MANY STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THE LCC-BASED DESIGN OF REGULAR STRUCTURES UNDER EARTHQUAKE LOADS, RARE STUDIES HAVE APPLIED IT TO IRREGULAR STRUCTURES. FURTHERMORE, THE LACK OF UTILIZATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING (BIM) CAPABILITIES IN PREVIOUS LCC-BASED DESIGN IS EVIDENT. THIS STUDY AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF IRREGULARITY ON OPTIMIZING THE LCC OF HIGH-RISE STEEL STRUCTURES BY PROVIDING AN OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK FOR SEISMIC DESIGN OF REGULAR AND IRREGULAR STRUCTURES INTEGRATING THE CAPABILITIES OF LCC AND BIM. USING BIM, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LIMITATIONS OF LCC ANALYSIS, SUCH AS TIME SPENT IN DATA COLLECTION AND EXCHANGE, AND TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY AND SPEED OF CALCULATIONS. THE FRAMEWORK HERE FIRST COMBINES RESULTS OF DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURAL AND STRUCTURAL SOFTWARE THROUGH PROGRAMMING WITHIN MATLAB ENVIRONMENT AND THEN USES NSGA-II ALGORITHM FOR ESTABLISHING A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INITIAL COST AND LCC. TO CHECK THE WORKABILITY OF THE FRAMEWORK, SIX 3D TALL STEEL STRUCTURES, WITH 10-, 13-, AND 20-FLOORS, IN TWO CATEGORIES OF REGULAR AND SETBACK IRREGULAR ARE FIRST DESIGNED FOR GRAVITY AND SEISMIC LOADS AND THEIR PERFORMANCE USING NON-LINEAR ANALYSES ARE THEN ANALYZED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INDIRECT COSTS OF IRREGULAR STRUCTURES WERE RELATIVELY HIGHER THAN REGULAR ONES WHILE HIGHER INITIAL COST NEEDED TO REDUCE LCC. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR BOTH THE 20-STORY REGULAR AND IRREGULAR STRUCTURES, A 15\% INCREASE IN INITIAL COSTS RESULTED IN A 24 AND 17\% REDUCTION IN THEIR LCCS, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THAT IRREGULAR STRUCTURES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUSTAINING EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE THAN REGULAR ONES, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK HERE CAN FURTHER PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF IRREGULAR STRUCTURES FROM AN LCC-BASED PERSPECTIVE.","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","AMIRKABIR UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","474","BEHROUZ.BEHNAM@UQCONNECT.EDU.AU",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s41062-024-01790-1","M1S4B","2364-4184",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2364-4176","INNOV.

THE RESEARCH BEGINS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE AND UTILIZES THE DELPHI METHOD TO IDENTIFY FOUR KEY NONCONFORMANCES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.

UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS MODEL MEASURES AND OPTIMIZES THE CARBON EMISSIONS LEVEL OF THE SYSTEM FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY RESULTS INDICATE THAT CARBON EMISSIONS OPTIMIZATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION RESULTS. FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE, THE CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING RESULT IS ABOUT 9 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OBTAINED ONLY DURING THE OPERATION PHASE. COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED IN THIS STUDY DECREASED BY 82.75 \%. IN ADDITION, CONSIDERING THAT THE SYSTEM PROVIDES CHARGING SERVICES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, WHICH CAN REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY ABOUT 93.6 \% BUT ONLY INCREASE COSTS BY ABOUT 29.4 \%. THE COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS JUSTIFY THE PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK. THIS STUDY PROVIDES OPTIMIZATION MODELS FOR THE SYSTEM, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK CAN SUPPORT TECHNICAL REFERENCE FOR PRACTICE.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","XINJIANG UNIVERSITY; XINJIANG UNIVERSITY; BEIJING UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY; NORTH CHINA ELECTRIC POWER UNIVERSITY","119103","15652112686@163.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.enconman.2024.119103","I3P9O","1879-2227","SEP 2024",NA,"NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION [2022D01C665]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS REGION UNIVERSITIES [XJEDU2022P023]; RESEARCH FUND FOR HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION [23YJCZH328]; MAJOR PROJECT OF NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA [21ZD133]","THIS RESEARCH IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION (2022D01C665) , THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS REGION UNIVERSITIES (XJEDU2022P023) , THE RESEARCH FUND FOR HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (23YJCZH328) , AND THE MAJOR PROJECT OF NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA (21\&ZD133) .

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FALL ACCIDENTS AND ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS AGE, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (MSPS), SLEEP HOURS, SAFETY KNOWLEDGE, USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE), AND WORKING HOURS AMONG HISPANIC CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INVOLVED IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. THIS STUDY COLLECTED 220 VALID RESPONSES AND USED NONPARAMETRIC CHI-SQUARE TESTS AND BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THE LOCATION OF THE FALL, MSPS, AND USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING FALL ACCIDENTS. THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF FALL ACCIDENTS WAS ``FALL FROM A LADDER'' FOLLOWED BY HAVING TWO OR THREE MSPS. THE USE OF PPE HAD THE HIGHEST DECREASING RATIO IN ODDS OF FALL ACCIDENTS, INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF WEARING PPE PROPERLY.

HOWEVER, THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF CLCA ENCOUNTERS CHALLENGES DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF COMMON GUIDELINES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDIED DIFFERENT SETS OF LITERATURE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLCA OF PLANT PROTEIN EXTRACTION THROUGH FRACTIONATION, USING CANADA AS AN EXAMPLE. GIVEN THAT ECONOMIC MODELS ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF CLCA, THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC MODELS EMPLOYED IN 18 CLCA STUDIES, SHEDDING LIGHT ON THEIR RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. NOTABLY, THE STUDY IDENTIFIES THE USE OF BOTH COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM AND PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELS FOR ENABLING THE ANALYSIS OF LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM CHANGES. THE ESTIMATION OF LAND USE CHANGES (BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT) IS AN INTEGRAL PART AND ECONOMIC MODELS ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN QUANTIFYING INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGES. FOR CHARACTERIZING THE COMMON MODELLING PRACTICES IN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR, 33 CLCA STUDIES WERE REVIEWED TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ON THE DECISION CONTEXT, TIME HORIZON, IDENTIFICATION OF MARGINAL/SUBSTITUTABLE MARKETS, UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES, ETC. `INCREASED SUPPLY' AND `INCREASED DEMAND' ARE BOTH FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT DECISION CONTEXTS. IT IS A COMMON PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY MARGINAL MARKETS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS, LITERATURE, AND OTHER SOURCES ALONG WITH EMPLOYING ECONOMIC MODELS FOR SOME CASES. HOWEVER, ECONOMIC MODELS IN THE AGRI-FOOD STUDIES WERE USED MORE OFTEN FOR ESTIMATING LAND USE CHANGE IMPACTS. TO ELABORATE THE CASE STUDY OF PLANT PROTEIN EXTRACTION (I.E., PEA FRACTIONATION), SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVE USES OF THE CO-PRODUCTS OF PEA FRACTIONATION PROCESSES AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING PROBABLE MARGINAL MARKETS WERE IDENTIFIED. BUILDING UPON THESE FINDINGS, THE REVIEW CULMINATES IN THE PROPOSAL OF A DETAILED METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CLCA APPLIED TO PEA FRACTIONATION, INCORPORATING CONSIDERATIONS OF MARGINAL MARKETS THAT REVOLVE AROUND UTILIZING CO-PRODUCTS LIKE PEA STARCH AND PEA FIBRE.

IN PARTICULAR, JAPANESE BUILDINGS, WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO RECENT EXTREME CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS AND NATURAL DISASTERS, ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE INDOOR THERMAL COMFORT, EVEN UNDER VARIOUS SITUATIONS. FOR THIS REASON, RECENT HVAC\&R-SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE FLEXIBLY CHANGED ACCORDING TO VARIOUS SITUATIONS. FURTHERMORE, DEMANDS FOR HVAC\&R-SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DIVERSIFYING IN RESPONSE TO ADVANCES IN WORK STYLES AND IT SYSTEMS, IMPROVEMENTS IN BUILDING PERFORMANCE, AND USER DEMANDS. IN ORDER TO OPTIMALLY PLAN AND OPERATE SUCH A COMPLEX HVAC\&R-SYSTEM, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PERFORM COMMISSIONING IN EACH LIFE-CYCLE PHASE OF DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE OPERATION METHOD OF THE HVAC\&R-SYSTEM EASY TO UNDERSTAND, TO CONVEY IT TO BUILDING USERS. IN RECENT YEARS, VIRTUAL VISUALIZATION OF BUILDING MODELS HAS BEEN RAPIDLY DEVELOPED BY BIM, WHICH CAN UNIFY INFORMATION FROM DESIGN TO CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION. IN JAPAN, IT IS USED FROM DESIGN THROUGH CONSTRUCTION, AND IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SOUGHT TO USE IT AS AN OPERATION TOOL, TO COMMUNICATE THE DESIGN INTENT.

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF STRUCTURES IS OF SIGNIFICANCE IN WHOLE LIFE MANAGEMENT, AND BIM PROVIDES A USEFUL TOOL TO ASSESS THE DURABILITY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING STRUCTURES AT THE DESIGN STAGE. CRACKING IS A SIGNIFICANT DURABILITY PROBLEM IN REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES AS IT DESTROYS THE INTEGRITY OF THE STRUCTURES AND CAUSES PREMATURE FAILURE. IT IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE TO PREDICT THE CRACKING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES AND INTEGRATE THE MODEL IN BIM PLATFORM SO THAT BETTER-INFORMED DECISIONS CAN BE MADE FOR DESIGNERS IN TERMS OF REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. IN THIS PAPER, THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (FEM) AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) ARE COMBINED TO PREDICT CONCRETE CRACKING OVER TIME.

LCC REQUIRES INCREASED INFORMATION COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL BUILDING COST CALCULATIONS. USE OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) BASED SOFTWARE SHOULD THEREFORE LEAD TO A HIGH INCREASE IN LCC CALCULATIONS FOR EVERY PROJECT. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND WHY BIM-BASED LCC CALCULATIONS ARE NOT USED MORE OFTEN. INTEGRATED DESIGN AND DELIVERY SOLUTIONS (IDDS) FROM CIB ARE USED AS A FRAMEWORK TO EXPLORE PRACTICAL USE OF LCC. IDDS FOCUS ON COLLABORATING PEOPLE, INTEGRATED PROCESSES AND INTEROPERABLE TECHNOLOGY. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF EXPLORING BIM-BASED SOFTWARE, LITERATURE REVIEW AND SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS IN BUILDING AND CIVIL ENGINEERING PROJECTS. THE STUDY IDENTIFIES A GAP BETWEEN THE PROCESS, THE PEOPLE, AND THE TECHNOLOGY. INCREASED USE OF LCC CALCULATIONS WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED INTEGRATION RATHER THAN DEVELOPMENT OF SEPARATE FACTORS.

AT THE CITY SCALE, A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDINGS IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE ENERGY POLICIES.

COUPLING LCA AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PROMISING SOLUTION BUT DEVELOPMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN AUTOMATED APPROACH FOR THE ENERGY MODELLING AND LCA OF URBAN HOUSING STOCKS BASED ON GIS. THE MAIN STEPS OF THE APPROACH ARE THE FOLLOWING: (I) GIS-BASED BUILDING STOCK CHARACTERIZATION; (II) AUTOMATED BUILDING-BY-BUILDING ENERGY ANALYSIS; (III) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CALCULATION VIA LCA. THE APPROACH WAS APPLIED TO THE TEST CASE CITY ESCH-SUR-ALZETTE (LUXEMBOURG) TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION DRIVEN BY HOUSING RETROFITTING. RESULTS WERE PROVIDED BUILDING-BY-BUILDING AND DISPLAYED AS MAPS FOR IMPROVED COMMUNICATION. AN ENERGY SAVINGS POTENTIAL OF 35.3\% AND A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) REDUCTION OF 30.8\% WERE CALCULATED AS RESULTS OF RETROFITTING. THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RETROFITTING STAGE ON THE RESIDUAL LIFE OF THE BUILDING STOCK IS 4 TO 10\% OF THE GWP, DEPENDING ON THE BUILDING TYPE.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE ``INFORMATION DISINTEGRATION'' ISSUE IN THE AECO INDUSTRY, WHICH DESCRIBES THE LACK OF CONSOLIDATION, UNIFICATION AND INTEGRATION OF BUILDING INFORMATION OVER THE PROJECT LIFECYCLE AND ACROSS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. THE OPTIONS OF BRIDGING THE KNOWLEDGE GAP BETWEEN THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION PHASES BY BIM HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED, AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR DATA INTEGRATION FOR FACILITY MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY IS PROPOSED TO IDENTIFY CURRENT PROBLEMS PERTAINING TO BIM UTILIZATION IN FACILITY MANAGEMENT, IN THE AREAS OF BUSINESS PROCESSES, STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIORS, AND TECHNOLOGIES.","439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM; UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO (UTSA)",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ICCEASI 2015","2024-12-24",NA,"BE7MJ",NA,NA,"ZHANG, X AND ZHAO, S AND XIE, YM",NA,NA,"978-1-60595-279-6",NA,NA,"3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ICCEASI 2015","ENGLISH",NA,"3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE (ICCEASI), HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA, JUL 01-03, 2015","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,"243-250","DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC","CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS; ENGINEERING","LIU, RUI/JPX-6368-2023",NA,0,"BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING SUPPORTED PROJECT LIFE CYCLE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS000375567700040","0","11",NA,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY; GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY; ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL; ENGINEERING, CIVIL","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2015,"LIU RUI","LIU, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TEXAS SAN ANTONIO, DEPT CONSTRUCT SCI, 501 W CESAR W CESAR E CHAVEZ BLVD, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78207 USA","ISI","3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ICCEASI 2015","none","UNIV TEXAS SAN ANTONIO;UNIV TEXAS SAN ANTONIO","UNIV TEXAS SAN ANTONIO",NA,"LIU R, 2015, 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ICCEASI 2015","LIU R, 2015, 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE, ICCEASI 2015",NA,NA,NA,NA

IN WHOLE EUROPE THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MASONRY RAILROAD BRIDGES AMOUNTS TO 70,000. NOWADAYS INCREASINGLY MORE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION OF EXISTING ARCH BRIDGES THAN ON THEIR RECONSTRUCTION, AS A RESULT OF FINANCIAL REASONS AS WELL AS MONUMENT CONSERVATION ASPECTS.

THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A MORE INDUSTRIALIZED WAY TO BUILD IN ORDER TO BETTER MANAGE QUALITY, COSTS, DELAYS, AND TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS. THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS THE MAIN CHALLENGES TO FACE SO TO ACHIEVE THIS TRANSFORMATION THROUGH A LITERATURE REVIEW.

THROUGH THE SUPPLY OF BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE SMOOTH OPERATION OF A BUSINESS, THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE GROWTH OF AN ECONOMY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. HOWEVER, DUE TO CARBON EMISSIONS FROM MATERIALS AND ENERGY, THIS BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. PREFABRICATION HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY IN NATIONS AS A RESULT OF ITS SEVERAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING QUALITY CONTROL, WASTE MINIMIZATION, ONSITE AND OFFSHORE PARALLEL TO COORDINATION, AND SO. IT’S ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A CRUCIAL APPROACH FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS CAUSED BY BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDY INTO REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS IN PREFABRICATION THROUGH THE USE OF ADVANCED TECHNICAL ARTEFACTS SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM), WHICH ARE EMERGING FROM THE TECHNOLOGY REALM. THE GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROVIDE A BIM-BASED METHOD FOR CALCULATING CARBON WITH THE USAGE OF THE PLCA METHOD. DURING THE MATERIALIZATION STAGE OF A PREFABRICATED CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, THERE IS A DECREASE. PARTIAL LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (PLCA) IS AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ESTIMATING CARBON EMISSIONS FROM NEW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY’S FINDINGS, AND PREFABRICATION REDUCES CARBON EMISSIONS WHEN APPLIED. AFTER COMPUTATION, THE COMPARISON IS BEING DONE USING THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO FIND THE PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE AND THIS SOFTWARE HELPS TO FIND THE ITERATION FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE STUDY ADDS TO THE CORPUS OF KNOWLEDGE ON CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION THROUGH PREFABRICATION. CONTRACTORS, HOUSE BUYERS, AND AUTHORITIES WHO ARE CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR METHODS TO BUILD A CIRCULAR ECONOMY SHOULD BE AWARE OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF CO2 . IN THIS STUDY, WE ARE EXPLORING HOW PRE-FABRICATED STRUCTURES ARE THE NEED OF THE FUTURE AND THEIR USEFULNESS TO THE VERY EXTENT TO DETERMINE THE EMISSIONS AT THE PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. AND DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE PRE-FABRICATED STRUCTURE BY COMPARING IT WITH THE CAST IN SITU AND TO DIFFERENTIATE THE RESULT BY CREATING A SIMULATION THROUGH MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS. © THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD. 2024.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/978-981-99-5455-1_39",NA,NA,NA,"KASHYAP A.

THIS IS DUE TO THE LACK OF A PROPER FORMAT FOR DATA INTERCHANGE, CAPABLE OF REPRESENTING ALL THE PECULIARITIES OF SUCH CONSTRUCTIONS, LIKE THE WIDE EXTENSION OF THE MODEL OVER A SURFACE AND ITS VERY HETEROGENEOUS COMPONENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, THIS GAP HAS BEEN PARTIALLY BRIDGED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC) FORMAT FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES, AS ALSO FOR THE RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO ASSESS THE MATURITY OF THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND THE DIFFICULTIES CONCERNING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT OF TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES USING BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING SOFTWARE IN THE DESIGN PHASE WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO INTEROPERABILITY OF THE DATA. THE AUTHORS FOCUSED THEIR ATTENTION ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF A NEW RAILWAY LAYOUT IN ITALY (PADUA - CHIOGGIA CONNECTION), THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOFTWARE TOOLS TO TEST THE INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THE EXPORT OF DATA IN THE IFC 4X3 STANDARD FORMAT. STARTING FROM THE DEFINITION OF THE TERRITORIAL CONSTRAINTS, THE GEOMETRIC PARAMETERS, THE UNIT COSTS AND THE RAILWAY SERVICE OF THE PROJECT, A SET OF DESIGN ALTERNATIVES WAS GENERATED. THROUGH THE RAILWAY LINE LIFE-CYCLE COST AND A DECISION-MAKING ANALYSIS, THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION WAS IDENTIFIED AMONG THE VARIOUS TRACK LAYOUTS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT REPAIR/MAINTENANCE ACTIONS AND END-OF-LIFE SCENARIOS WERE ANALYSED USING TWO TOOLS: AN LCA BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING-BASED TOOL AND AN LCA OPEN-SOURCE TOOL. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT REPAIRING AND MAINTAINING THE STEEL STRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SAFETY AND PRESERVATION OF THE STEEL STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, STEEL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PRACTICES THAT INVOLVE FEWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS NEED TO BE EXPLORED. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: IT ALSO EMPHASISES THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF FACILITY MANAGERS IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY AND SUPPORTING INFORMED DECISION-MAKING THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING’S LIFE CYCLE, THEREBY AIDING IN THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOAL OF DECARBONISATION BY 2050. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT MAINTENANCE PROCESSES IN BUILDING MANAGEMENT HAVE A GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT COMPARED TO MATERIAL REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE STEEL STRUCTURE WITHIN THE CASE STUDY BUILDING, AS ASSESSED USING TWO LCA SOFTWARE TOOLS. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT PHASES AND UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO MORE SUSTAINABLE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES WITHIN FACILITY MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDY RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, CONTRIBUTING POSITIVELY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. © 2024, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1108/F-02-2024-0018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"02632772","FACILITIES","FACILITIES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EMERALD PUBLISHING",NA,NA,NA,0,"LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPLIED TO FACILITY MANAGEMENT OF EXPOSED STEEL FRAMES – CASE STUDY","ARTICLE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024,"MATOS RAQUEL;RODRIGUES HUGO;COSTA ANÍBAL GUIMARÃES;RODRIGUES MARIA FERNANDA;LAVY SAREL;DIXIT MANISH","R.

THE LCA PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF A PRODUCT THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE, FROM THE EXTRACTION OF RAW MATERIALS TO DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING. THE LLMS ARE NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES, TYPICALLY UTILIZING VARIANTS OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS SUCH AS THE TRANSFORMER, WHICH ARE TRAINED ON LARGE BODIES OF TEXTUAL DATA USING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS PRE-TRAINING AND FINE-TUNING. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE USE OF BACTERIAL CELLULOSE COMPOSITES AS A BIOBASED UNCONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL. THE METHODOLOGY OF DEVELOPING AN LLM-AIDED LCA TOOL IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE STAGES: DEFINING THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT; IDENTIFYING THE LIFE CYCLE STAGES; COLLECTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT DATA; INTERPRETING AND EVALUATING; DEVELOPING A WEB-BASED TOOL. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HAVE SHOWN THAT THE DESIGNERS CAN INCORPORATE SUSTAINABLE THINKING IN THE DESIGN PROCESS BY USING LLMS INTEGRATED TO LCA, ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF THE ANTHROPOCENE. OVERALL, THE OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION (HCI) AS A TOOL FOR EXPLORING NEW POSSIBILITIES WITH BIOBASED MATERIALS AND FOR INSPIRING DESIGNERS TO RECONSIDER THE MATERIAL EVALUATION IN THEIR WORK. FUTURE STUDIES CAN DELVE INTO THE INTEGRATION OF THIS TOOL INTO BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING SOFTWARE OR COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO PERFORM LCA FOR 3D STRUCTURES. DIFFERENT SCALES OF SUCH APPLICATIONS IN DESIGN PRACTICES, SUCH AS FASHION DESIGN, PRODUCT DESIGN OR SERVICE DESIGN CAN ALSO BE CONDUCTED BY QUESTIONING HOW LCA CAN BE COMBINED WITH LLMS TO LEVERAGE NOVEL SUSTAINABLE DESIGN SOLUTIONS. © 2023, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH IN COMPUTER AIDED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN IN EUROPE.

HOWEVER, THE INTEGRATION OF THIS POWERFUL METHODOLOGY INTO BUILDING DESIGN TOOLS IS STILL POOR, LIMITING THE ABILITY OF PROJECTS TO OPTIMIZE THE COSTS OF BUILDINGS DURING THEIR LIFE CYCLE. THE EMERGENCE OF IFC (INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES) TECHNOLOGY IN THE FIELD OF ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION, HELPED THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AT THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE STAGE OF A PROJECT TO BE SHARED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE DESIGN TOOLS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST, BASED ON A BIM (BUILDING INFORMATION MODELING) MODEL THAT CAN CONTAIN RELEVANT DATA RELATED TO THE PROJECT/BUILT ASSET [25].

THIS RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO FORM THE BASIS FOR BIM (SEMI) AUTOMATION OF WHOLE BUILDING LCA BY ENABLING THE INTEGRATION OF LCA DATA USING THE INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC). THE DIN EN 15804 COMPLIANT AND OPEN ACCESS ÖKOBAUDAT IS USED AS THE DATABASE FOR LCA DATA.

CURRENTLY, FEW PUBLICATIONS EXPLICITLY RELATE THE INTEGRATION OF LCA AND BIM WITH THE SPECIFICITIES OF DISTINCT DEVELOPMENT STAGES IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS OR LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT (LOD) OF BIM OBJECTS. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE SOURCES OF LCA INFORMATION TO INCLUDE IN BIM MODELS AND DISCUSSES THE COMPLEXITY OF LCA INFORMATION NEEDED FOR DISTINCT BIM OBJECTS' LOD. A PARAMETRIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION IS PROPOSED, TO BE INCLUDED IN BIM OBJECTS, BASED ON AN EVOLUTIONARY LEVEL OF DETAIL IN LCA INFORMATION FOR INCREASING LODS. © PUBLISHED UNDER LICENCE BY IOP PUBLISHING LTD.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1088/1755-1315/225/1/012075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"17551307","IOP CONF.

THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) TECHNIQUE IS THE MOST FIRMLY ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGY USED TO QUANTIFY THESE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND, THEREFORE, HAS BEEN APPLIED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS. TO EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE A BUILDING'S ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, AN INTEGRATION OF LCA IN THE DESIGN PROCESS IS REQUIRED. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY COUPLING LCA WITH DIGITAL DESIGN TOOLS, E.G., BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM). TO IDENTIFY THE PRO AND CONS OF STREAMLINING THE INTEGRATION OF LCA AND BIM, A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW (SLR) WAS PERFORMED. WE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 50 RELEVANT BIM-LCA CASE STUDIES AND ANALYZED THE APPLIED BIM-LCA WORKFLOWS IN DETAIL. IN MOST OF THE STUDIES REVIEWED, THE LCA HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN EARLY DESIGN STAGE. THE AUTHORS PRIMARILY USED LCA TOOLS AND MANUAL OR SEMI-AUTOMATIC METHODS TO EXCHANGE DATA BETWEEN BIM MODELS. IN MOST CASES, CONTEMPORARY BIM-LCA WORKFLOWS UTILIZED CONVENTIONAL SPREADSHEETS (E.G., EXCEL WORKSHEETS). HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT AN AUTOMATED LINK BETWEEN LCA AND BIM CAN BE ACHIEVED IF CERTAIN CHALLENGES ARE OVERCOME.

THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PRODUCES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WASTE WHILE THE CAPACITY OF LANDFILLS IS BEING LIMITED. THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY USED MATERIALS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE REUSED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY HELP TO DECREASE CONSUMPTION AND SAVE NATURAL RESOURCES. LCA IS A METHOD THAT CAN BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUITABILITY OF PROPOSED MATERIALS, STRUCTURES OR BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF THEIR WHOLE LIFE CYCLE AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. FOR AN LCA EVALUATION, IT IS CRUCIAL TO OBTAIN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) INPUT DATA, THOUGH THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DATA HAS NOT YET BEEN CLEARLY DEFINED FOR THE CZECH ENVIRONMENT. BIM INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO GEOMETRY, AN INFORMATION COMPONENT WHICH IS APPLICABLE TO THIS ASSESSMENT. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE PREVIOUS APPROACHES AND DEFINE A BIM DATA STRUCTURE FOR A PARTICULAR MATERIAL FOR LCI PURPOSES. THE NEW METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON THE STANDARDIZATION OF A NON-GRAPHICAL INFORMATION MODEL DATA STRUCTURE (SNIM) WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE CZECH CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. “MARKUP SYNTAXES” HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SNIM DATABASE AND USED TO FURTHER IDENTIFY THE DATA FOR LCI BASE STRUCTURE PURPOSES. THE MATLAB MATRIX SOLVER WAS USED TO CLASSIFY THESE DATA. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED VIA A CASE STUDY OF A MONOLITHIC CONCRETE SLAB STRUCTURE IN WHICH THREE TYPES OF CONCRETE WERE EVALUATED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE PERCENTAGE OF IMPACT CATEGORIES FOR EACH CONCRETE TYPE. THESE RESULTS ARE USEFUL FOR EXPANDING THE BIM MODEL WITH NEW DATA NECESSARY FOR FURTHER LCA CALCULATIONS.

THIS IS COMBINED WITH THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE WITHIN BIM TO INTEGRATE AND SUPPORT ALL INVOLVED EXPERTS AIMING TOWARDS AN IMPROVED COLLABORATION. CURRENTLY THE NECESSARY DATA OFTEN ONLY EXISTS IN A VERY FRAGMENTED AND UNCOORDINATED WAY THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT SUBSECTIONS, AS WELL AS PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. A LACK OF ORGANIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IS ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE IN FINALIZED BUILT OBJECTIVES DURING QUESTIONS OF CONVERSION AND REFURBISHMENT. BIM TRIES TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF ITS USERS AND ALLOWS FOR A COORDINATED ACCUMULATION OF DATA, AS WELL AS SYNCHRONOUSLY KEEPING THE PLANNING STATUS UP TO DATE. HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES ESSENTIAL INFORMATION IS MISSING OR NOT USED THROUGHOUT THE COMPLETE LIFECYCLE OF THE BUILDING. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE CLEAR GAPS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF PLANNING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. WITHIN THIS PAPER, WE GIVE AN EVALUATION OF APPLICABLE METHODS FOR DATA COLLECTION AND MODELING OF THE ACTUAL INVENTORY OF COMPONENTS WITH REGARD TO POSITION, GEOMETRY AND SEMANTICS (E.G. MATERIAL) FOR THE PURPOSE OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND BIM-COMPLIANT AS-BUILT DOCUMENTATION. THIS ALLOWS THE ANALYSIS OF MISSING INTERFACES AND DATA. CONSIDERED FROM A PROCESS AUTOMATION VIEWPOINT, WE IDENTIFY MISSING BIM DATA E.G. FOR ASSEMBLY PROCESSES WITHIN CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO CREATE A BIM-AIDED PLANNING PROCESS THAT CONTINUES INTO ACTUAL FABRICATION AND CONSTRUCTION. BASED ON THIS, WE DISCUSS POSSIBILITIES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SEMI-AUTOMATED DECISION SUPPORT TOOL FOR BIM USERS. PRIMARY GOAL IS TO PROVIDE CONCEPTS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES AS WELL AS OPTIONS FOR CONVERSION PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS. THESE TARGETS IMPLY A CONTINUOUS UPDATING OF THE BIM MODELS (INCLUDING THE SEMANTIC PARAMETERS) FROM A CONTINUOUS ‘AS-BUILT’ ACQUISITION AND MODELING OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS.

A COMBINATION OF THE BIM-BASED DESIGN AND ANALYSIS TOOL REVIT ARCHITECTURE, THE ENERGY SIMULATION TOOL GREEN BUILDING STUDIO (GBS) AND THE LCA TOOL ATHENA IMPACT ESTIMATOR WERE USED FOR THE ASSESSMENT. THE LCA WAS CARRIED OUT ON A LIFE CASE STUDY OF A 2100 M2 TWO-FLOOR PRIMARY-SCHOOL BUILDING, AS WELL AS A VARIABILITY ANALYSIS, BY VARYING THE MATERIAL SPECIFICATION IN TERMS OF WHOLE BUILDING MATERIALS. THE LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUILDINGS WAS PRIMARILY EVALUATED IN TERMS OF ITS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) AND HEALTH IMPACT. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE MATERIALS USED, BUILDINGS THAT ARE BASED ON RENEWABLE ENERGY PERFORM BETTER THAN THOSE BASED ON FOSSIL FUELS OVER THEIR LIFE CYCLE. IN TERMS OF BUILDING MATERIALS, BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH PREFERENCES OF BUILDINGS CONGRUENTLY RANGE FROM TIMBER, BRICK/BLOCK AND STEEL TO INSULATED CONCRETE FORMWORK (ICF), IN DESCENDING ORDER. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT AS BUILDINGS BECOME MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT DURING OPERATIONAL STAGES, SERIOUS ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO THEIR EMBODIED IMPACT. THE STUDY LAYS OUT A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK THAT COULD BE ADOPTED BY INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS IN EVALUATING LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENT BIM-MODELLED MATERIAL OPTIONS AT THE BUILDING CONCEPTION STAGE.

SEEING THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN PHASE TO CARBON EMISSIONS DURING BUILDING'S LIFECYCLE, A STUDY ON REGRESSION MODEL OF CARBON EMISSIONS USING DESIGNING FACTORS WAS DONE. FIRSTLY, BASED ON PROCESS ANALYSIS METHOD, THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF 207 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN TIANJIN WERE CALCULATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ANNUAL CARBON EMISSIONS PER FLOOR AREA ARE BETWEEN 30 AND 60 KGCO(2)/(M(2).YEAR), WITH MANUFACTURE PHASE AND OPERATION PHASE ACCOUNTING FOR 11\%-25\% AND 75\%-87\%, RESPECTIVELY. THEN, CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND ELASTIC NET WERE USED TO DETERMINE 12 DESIGNING FACTORS FOR PREDICTIVE MODEL; AT LAST, FOUR REGRESSION TECHNIQUES, PCR, RF, MLP AND SVR WERE USED TO DEVELOP REGRESSION MODELS, RESPECTIVELY; COMPARISON AND PROCESS ANALYSIS OF MODEL DEVELOPMENT WERE GIVEN LATER. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SVR HAS THE OPTIMAL PREDICTIVE ACCURACY AMONG FOUR MODELS, ITS CORRESPONDING COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION CAN REACH TO 0.800.

IT FOCUSES ON CURRENT RESEARCH TRENDS, AND ELABORATES ON GAPS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY CURRENT RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS OF LCA IN BUILDINGS. THE PROPOSED REVIEW METHODOLOGY INCLUDES (I) IDENTIFYING RECENT AUTHORITATIVE RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS USING ESTABLISHED SEARCH ENGINES, (II) SCREENING AND RETAINING RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS, AND (III) EXTRACTING RELEVANT LCA APPLICATIONS FOR BUILDINGS AND ANALYZING THEIR UNDERPINNING RESEARCH. SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL RESEARCH GAPS AND LIMITATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED, WHICH HAVE INFORMED OUR PROPOSED FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT HUMANS CAN ATTENUATE AND POSITIVELY CONTROL THE IMPACT OF THEIR BUILDINGS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, AND AS SUCH MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY A NEW GENERATION OF LCA METHODS AND TOOLS THAT ARE MODEL BASED AND CONTINUOUSLY LEARN FROM REAL-TIME DATA, WHILE INFORMING EFFECTIVE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF BUILDINGS AND DISTRICTS. THEREFORE, THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TIME DIMENSION IN PRODUCT SYSTEM MODELING IS BECOMING ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE RESULTING POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. THIS TIME DIMENSION IS CURRENTLY MISSING IN LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATABASES. A FURTHER COMBINATION OF LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) MODELS USING TIME-DEPENDENT CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS CAN LEAD TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND RELIABLE LCA RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THIS PAPER PROMOTES THE CONCEPT OF SEMANTIC-BASED DYNAMIC (REAL-TIME) LCA, WHICH ADDRESSES TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN THE LOCAL BUILT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ECOSYSTEM, AND THUS MORE EFFECTIVELY PROMOTES A ``CRADLE-TO-GRAVE-TO-REINCARNATION'' ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY CAPABILITY.

NONETHELESS, ENHANCING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION THROUGH TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS SUCH AS ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS (ESS) IS GETTING HIGHER IMPORTANCE TO INCREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF PV PLANTS, BY MINIMIZING THE BUILDING-GRID INTERACTION. IN THIS CONTEXT, ANALYZING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT ENERGY STORAGE CONFIGURATIONS BECOMES MORE RELEVANT AND CRUCIAL IN BUILDING ENERGY MODELING ALTHOUGH IT IS HEAVILY TIME-CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED, PARTICULARLY WITHIN A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION RELATED TO THE ESS DESIGN. AS A SOLUTION TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE ACCURACY, TRAINING, AND PREDICTION SPEED OF 24 MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODELS TO BE USED AS SURROGATE MODELS FOR ANALYZING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN SMART BUILDINGS. FURTHERMORE, THE PERFORMANCE OF SHORT-TERM THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE (TES) TO INCREASE PV SELF -CONSUMPTION IS ASSESSED AND PRESENTED USING ML MODELS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION (GPR), NEURAL NETWORKS (NN) INCLUDING BILAYERED AND TRILAYERED NN MODELS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM) INCLUDING THE FINE GAUSSIAN AND CUBIC SVM MODELS, AND ENSEMBLES OF TREES (EOT) AS SUPERIOR ML MODELS. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEALED THAT TES SYSTEMS CAN EFFICIENTLY INCREASE PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN THE BUILDING EQUIPPED WITH ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS TO PROVIDE HEATING, COOLING, AND DOMESTIC HOT WATER. MOREOVER, THE TES SIZE OPTIMIZATION REGARDING THE LIFE CYCLE COST (LCC) SHOWED THAT THE LCC-BASED OPTIMUM TES SIZE CAN YIELD 7.1\% SAVINGS WITHIN 30 YEARS OF THE BUILDING SERVICE LIFE. THE NOVELTIES OF THIS RESEARCH ARE FIRST TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO SELECT THE MOST SUITABLE ML MODELS IN PREDICTING PV SELF-CONSUMPTION, SECOND TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF SHORT-TERM THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE TO ENHANCE PV SELF-CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS, AND THIRD TO CARRY OUT AN LCC-BASED OPTIMIZATION ON TES SIZE USING ML-BASED PREDICTION MODELS.","125 LONDON WALL, LONDON, ENGLAND","POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF MILAN","120648","HASHEM.AMINI@POLIMI.IT",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120648","C6TT7","1872-9118","JAN 2023",NA,"EU RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME HORIZON 2020 [768921 - HEART]; EUROPEAN COMMISSION","THIS STUDY AND PROJECT ARE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY EU RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME HORIZON 2020 THROUGH NUMBER 768921 - HEART.

BUILDING STRUCTURES ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF A BUILDING'S EMBODIED EMISSIONS AND THEY ALSO ARE THE BUILDING ELEMENT WITH THE LONGEST SERVICE LIFE, THUS PRESENTING POTENTIAL LOCK-IN CHALLENGES FOR CHOICES MADE TODAY. TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING GLOBAL EFFORT TO MITIGATE EMBODIED CARBON AND EQUIP ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS WORLDWIDE WITH EASY-TO-USE AND ROBUST CALCULATION TOOLS, WE DESCRIBE A REAL-TIME DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL TO AID BUILDING DESIGN THAT LEVERAGES MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE TO SPEED-UP THE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE PROCESS OF FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS (FEA) TRADITIONALLY EXPLOITED IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT REPLACING FEA CALCULATIONS WITH A MODEL LEARNT USING ML FROM A LARGE DATASET OFFERS REAL TIME DECISION SUPPORT WHILE GUARANTEEING THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND ACCURACY THAT A TRADITIONAL FEA-BASED METHOD WOULD OFFER AT THE DESIGN STAGE. THE TOOL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BOTH AS A STANDALONE VERSION AND AS A PLUGIN FOR TRIMBLE SKETCHUP TO MAXIMISE ITS USABILITY AND DIFFUSION. IT OFFERS RESULTS CORRELATED WITH UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN THE FORM OF PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INHERENT VARIABILITY OF INPUT DATA THAT CHARACTERISES EARLY STAGES IN THE DESIGN PROCESS.

HOWEVER, THE LIFESPANS OF BUILDINGS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN PRACTICE, AND APPLYING A UNIFORM LIFESPAN TO ALL BUILDINGS WITH THE SAME STRUCTURAL TYPE MAY LEAD TO COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS LCA RESULTS. IN THIS STUDY, LCAS OF WATERPROOFING METHODS ON BUILDING MODELS AND ACTUAL BUILDINGS IN KOREA ARE USED TO EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECT OF REALISTIC LIFESPAN PREDICTION USING BIG DATA. APPLYING A MORE REPRESENTATIVE BUILDING LIFESPAN OF 5-39 YEARS IN THE WATERPROOFING LCAS OF AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL DECREASED THE CARBON EMISSIONS IN ALL PHASES (CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AND DEMOLITION) BY 78-24\%, RESPECTIVELY, RELATIVE TO A 50 YEAR LIFESPAN ASSUMPTION. DURING THE MAINTENANCE PHASE, THE REDUCTIONS WERE 100-31\%, RESPECTIVELY. THE ACCURACY OF THE WATERPROOFING LCAS OF 17 REAL BUILDINGS BECAME MORE IRREGULAR AS THE PERCENTAGE ERROR OF THE PREDICTED LIFESPAN INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE LCA ANALYSIS RESULTS HAD 0\% ERROR FOR BUILDINGS WITH A PREDICTED LIFESPAN ERROR OF 6\% OR LESS. THEREFORE, DEPENDING ON THE RESEARCH PURPOSE, A LOW-ERROR PREDICTIVE BUILDING LIFESPAN MODEL CAN EVIDENTLY SUPPORT ACCURATE LCA RESULTS.

IN RESPONSE TO THIS, THIS RESEARCH INTRODUCES A NOVEL APPROACH BY HARNESSING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT WLCE AND WLCE INTENSITY (NORMALISED BY FLOOR AREA) FOR BUILDINGS. TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT INVOLVING TEN ALGORITHMS TO BUILD THE PREDICTION MODELS. THESE MODELS WERE TRAINED USING DATA FROM 150 TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN CORNWALL, UK, ALONG WITH 28 FEATURES OBTAINED FROM A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY, INCLUDING FLOOR AREA, HEATING TYPE, AND OCCUPANT CHARACTERISTICS. THE TEN ALGORITHMS INCLUDE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION, AND NON-LINEAR ALGORITHMS SUCH AS DECISION TREE, RANDOM FOREST. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION METRICS, SUCH AS COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R2), MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE), MEANS SQUARED ERROR (MSE), ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERROR (RMSE), AND ELAPSED TIME, WERE EMPLOYED. OUR RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIELD BY SHOWCASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS IN PREDICTING BUILDING WLCE.

THIS IS BECAUSE AM HAS DEMONSTRATED IMPRESSIVE GREEN CHARACTERISTICS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MATERIAL AND ENERGY CONSUMPTIONS, A SHORTER SUPPLY CHAIN, AND DIVERSION OF THE WASTE STREAM BY REPARATION, ETC. THE MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF AM ARE BASED ON UTILIZING THE KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) METHODOLOGY. FURTHER, CURRENT STUDIES ON ASSESSING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF AM ARE BASED ON A LIMITED SELECTION OF DESIGN- OR PROCESS-RELATED PARAMETERS. THESE KNOWLEDGE BARRIERS MAY CAUSE DELAYS AND CHALLENGES IN THE SELECTION OF THE OPTIMAL DESIGN AND PROCESS PARAMETERS FOR ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED PARTS. SUCH CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT DURING THE PRODUCT DESIGN AND PLANNING STAGES DUE TO THE ITERATIVE DESIGN-EVALUATION PROCESS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR AN AUTOMATED LCA TOOL TO SUPPORT AM TOWARD ELEVATED SUSTAINABILITY. AS SUCH, THIS PAPER PROVIDES THREE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. FIRSTLY, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO IDENTIFY A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF INFLUENTIAL AM DESIGN AND PROCESS PARAMETERS THAT POSE AN IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF AM. SECONDLY, THIS REVIEW ALSO SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF EACH OF THESE PARAMETERS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF AM. LASTLY, TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, NO WORK IN THE LITERATURE HAS BEEN REPORTED ON AUTOMATING LCA FOR AM. THUS, THIS PAPER PROMOTES RESEARCH TOWARD A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN AND INNOVATIVE AM TECHNOLOGY BY PROPOSING A NEW FRAMEWORK TO AUTOMATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PROCESS.

THIS PAPER INTRODUCES SOME OF THE INDUSTRY CHALLENGES ALONG WITH AN OVERVIEW OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, THE PAPER INCLUDES QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW DATA THAT IS DRIVING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WORKING MODEL THAT INTEGRATES EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE BUDGET, SCHEDULE, AND SUSTAINABILITY EFFICIENCIES. FINALLY, THE PAPER DISCUSSES HOW IT IS ENVISAGED THAT INTEGRATING THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING WITHIN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT LIFECYCLE.","152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","SKEMA BUSINESS SCHOOL",NA,"LUKE.DESMOND@SKEMA.EDU",NA,NA,"PROCEEDINGS OF NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ICICT 2024, VOL 4","2024-12-24","10.1007/978-981-97-3562-4\_33","BX7UM","2367-3389",NA,"YANG, XS AND SHERRATT, S AND DEY, N AND JOSHI, A",NA,NA,"978-981-97-3561-7; 978-981-97-3562-4","2367-3370",NA,"PROCEEDINGS OF NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ICICT 2024, VOL 4","ENGLISH",NA,"9TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICICT), LONDON, ENGLAND, FEB 19-22, 2024","30",NA,NA,NA,"GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE RES FOUNDAT","417-429","SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD","COMPUTER SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS",NA,"LECTURE NOTES IN NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS",0,"INTEGRATION OF CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND DATA SCIENCE INTO THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT LIFECYCLE","PROCEEDINGS PAPER","WOS001326998600032","0","0","1014","COMPUTER SCIENCE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY \& METHODS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS","CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX - SCIENCE (CPCI-S)",2024,"DESMOND LUKE;SALAMA MOHAMED","DESMOND, L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), SKEMA BUSINESS SCH, LILLE, FRANCE","ISI","PROCEEDINGS OF NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ICICT 2024, VOL 4","none","SKEMA BUSINESS SCH;SKEMA BUSINESS SCH;APPL SCI UNIV","SKEMA BUSINESS SCH",NA,"DESMOND L, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ICICT 2024, VOL 4","DESMOND L, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ICICT 2024, VOL 4",NA,NA,NA,NA

BOTH TOOLS EMPLOY DATA BASED ON (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO) CITYGML, TABULA, AND OKOBAUDAT. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT DISTELCA'S GRANULAR APPROACH LEADS TO AN OVERESTIMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, WHICH CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE STATISTICAL APPROACH TO OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE AND RELATED EMISSIONS. WHILE BOTH TOOLS LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL TIME SAVINGS, TECO REQUIRES LESS MANUAL EFFORT.

SUCH EXPLAINABILITY FEATURE OF ML MODEL PREDICTIONS IS A MUST FOR CRITICAL SYSTEMS. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO AUGMENT OUR LIFECYCLE MODEL WITH EXPLAINABILITY FEATURES. THUS, OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A GENERIC ML LIFECYCLE PROCESS AUGMENTED WITH SECURITY AND EXPLAINABILITY FEATURES. SUCH AN ML LIFECYCLE PROCESS WILL BE OF IMMENSE USE IN ML SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL DOMAINS. © 2021 IEEE.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1109/UEMCON53757.2021.9666619",NA,NA,NA,"PAUL R.",NA,NA,"978-166540690-1",NA,"IEEE ANNU.

SINCE THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS IN A COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO CAN INCLUDE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR FASTER WAYS TO ESTIMATE IMPACT HOTSPOTS AND TO ULTIMATELY OBTAIN ADEQUATE INVENTORIES. IN RECENT YEARS MACHINE LEARNING (ML) HAS EMERGED AS A PROMISING STRATEGY TO TACKLE COST- AND RESOURCE-PROHIBITIVE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. HOWEVER, TO BE PRACTICALLY APPLIED, NEW CONCEPTS MUST NOT ONLY BE BUILT ON A LARGE DATA BASIS ALLOWING TO PREDICT DIVERSE PRODUCTS WITH VARYING REFERENCE FLOWS, BUT THEY MUST ALSO ENSURE HIGH DATA QUALITY BY REFLECTING DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNCERTAINTIES. THEREFORE, IN THIS PUBLICATION WE PURSUED THREE DISTINCT OBJECTIVES: BUILDING ON DIGITIZED ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATIONS, WE FIRST PREDICTED LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ANN) AND SECOND PERFORMED AN IN-DEPTH CHARACTERIZATION OF UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS METHODS TO IDENTIFY WHICH METHODS CAN ANALYZE WHAT UNCERTAINTY TYPES.

AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ENERGY DEMAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING STOCKS AT LARGE SPATIAL SCALES IS INCREASINGLY NEEDED FOR DECISION SUPPORT IN SUSTAINABLE PLANNING AND POLICY MAKING. WHILE CURRENT BOTTOM-UP BUILDING STOCK MODELS MAINLY FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE, A NEW RESEARCH TREND HAS INTRODUCED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) FOR A MORE HOLISTIC ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT INCLUDING SEVERAL STAGES OF THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS A SET OF SELECTED BOTTOM-UP LCA STUDIES EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BUILDING STOCKS AT SEVERAL SCALES, FROM URBAN TO TRANSNATIONAL. THE SELECTED STUDIES WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THREE COMMON ELEMENTS: BUILDING STOCK AGGREGATION MODEL, ENERGY ANALYSIS AND LCA. TWO MAIN STOCK AGGREGATION APPROACHES, ARCHETYPES AND BUILDING-BY-BUILDING, ARE APPLIED TO MODEL INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS AND EXTRAPOLATE RESULTS AT THE STOCK LEVEL. BOTTOM-UP ENERGY MODELS, EITHER STATISTICAL OR ENGINEERING-BASED, PROVIDE ENERGY PROFILES FOR THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF BUILDINGS. LCA IS SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND SUPPORT POLICY DECISIONS. CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LCA OF LARGE BUILDING STOCKS ARE FINALLY ADDRESSED AND DISCUSSED TO SUPPORT FUTURE WORKS. BUILDING STOCK AGGREGATION MODELS MAY BE ENHANCED BY ADDRESSING MODEL CALIBRATION, INTEGRATION WITH GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) AND STOCK DYNAMICS MODELS. UNCERTAINTY PROPAGATION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND MODEL SIMPLIFICATION ARE RECOMMENDED FOR ENERGY MODELS AND LCA TO BRIDGE DATA GAPS AND REDUCE COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE MODELS. FUTURE RESEARCH IS ENCOURAGED ON THE INCLUSION OF CLIMATE CHANGE, EVOLUTION OF THE ENERGY SUPPLY AND INTEGRATED MODELING FOR THE LCA OF BUILDING STOCKS.","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","LUXEMBOURG INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY",NA,"MASTRUCC@IIASA.AC.AT",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.060","EV1FU","1879-0690",NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND, LUXEMBOURG [AFR - 7579115]","THIS PROJECT IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FUND, LUXEMBOURG, GRANT AGREEMENTS AFR - 7579115 ``DAEDALUS''.",NA,"1364-0321","RENEW.

TO QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL FOR REDUCING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, BUILDING-STOCK MODELLING (BSM) IS COMMONLY USED. RECENTLY, THE FOCUS OF BSM HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). HOWEVER, IMPACT CATEGORIES ARE OFTEN LIMITED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND REPRESENTATIVE BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN USED. IN ADDITION, THE FUTURE STATE OF THE STOCK IS OFTEN CALCULATED AS A STEP-CHANGE TO HIGHLIGHT THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL OF AN IDEAL FUTURE STATE. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AN URBAN HOUSING-STOCK UNDER BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIOS USING A BUILDING-SPECIFIC GIS BASED MODEL APPLIED TO THE MULTI-FAMILY BUILDING STOCK OF THE CITY OF GOTHENBURG. THIS PAPER USES AN EXPLORATIVE LCA TO ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BASED ON DYNAMIC UPTAKE OF COMMON RENOVATION MEASURES AND RESULTING ENERGY SAVINGS UNTIL 2050. TWO MAIN SCENARIOS ARE USED WHERE THE RENOVATION LOGIC IS BASED ON EITHER END-OF-LIFE OF COMPONENTS OR COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND FURTHER DIVIDED USING LIMITING FACTORS REGARDING INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND ANNUAL SHARE OF THE STOCK TO BE RENOVATED. RESULTS SHOW POSSIBLE ENERGY SAVINGS OF UP TO 23\% AND A CORRESPONDING 31\% REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS. GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS AVOIDED DUE TO REDUCED ENERGY DEMAND ARE OFFSET BY UP TO 65\% BY ACCOUNTING FOR MATERIAL USE DUE TO CONSTRUCTION RELATED RENOVATION MEASURES.

METHODS THIS METHODOLOGY WAS BASED ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DATA AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS), WHICH HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE DATA WERE CHARACTERIZED AT THREE LEVELS: GLOBAL, REPRESENTED BY DIFFERENT PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF MATERIALS; REGIONAL, REPRESENTED BY THE TYPE OF ELECTRICITY MIX USED IN THE PRODUCTION AND THE NATIONAL TRANSPORT AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL; AND LOCAL, REPRESENTED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS, SUCH AS SEISMIC AND WIND RISK ZONES AT THE CITY LEVEL. A COMPARATIVE LCA WAS USED AS CASE STUDY TO TEST THE METHODOLOGY. THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT FOR THE LCA WAS DEFINED AS AN 18 M(2) CORE SHELTER UNIT CONSISTING OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS ONLY. THE BILL OF MATERIALS FOR FIVE DESIGNS WERE CALCULATED, EACH USING A DISTINCTIVE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL: BAMBOO, BRICK, CONCRETE HOLLOW BLOCK, FERRO-CEMENT PANELS, AND SOIL-STABILISED BRICKS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS' VARIABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE RESULTS. THE EFFECT OF THE EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS (EARTHQUAKES AND WIND) WERE ANALYSED, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OVER THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE WAS ASSESSED. FIVE HOUSE DESIGNS WERE CALCULATED IN TWENTY LOCATIONS BASED ON THREE LEVELS OF PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND THREE TRANSPORT DISTANCE RANGES FOR EACH COUNTRY. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE RESULTS OF THE BAMBOO, CONCRETE HOLLOW BLOCK AND FERRO-CEMENT HOUSES OVERLAPPED AND CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS' TRANSPORT DISTANCE. THEREFORE, THE LEVEL OF IMPACT OF AN AVERAGE BAMBOO HOUSE CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED BY A HIGH-PERFORMANCE BLOCK OR FERRO-CEMENT HOUSE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT IN MOST CASES, THE BUILDINGS WITH HIGH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. CONCLUSIONS THE USE OF GIS ENABLES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTERIZED LCIA DATA FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND BUILDINGS WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONSISTENCY. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED APPROACH WAS ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE RANGE OF PRODUCTION PRACTICES USED OUTSIDE EUROPE. FINALLY, THE USE OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ALLOWS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF BUILDING IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN WHEN UNCERTAINTY IS AT ITS HIGHEST, THEREBY IDENTIFYING THE IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL OF EACH DESIGN AND RECOGNISING THE STRUCTURAL NEEDS IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH; SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN; ETH ZURICH",NA,"EDWIN.ZEA@CCRS.UZH.CH",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-016-1238-y","FA2TD","1614-7502",NA,NA,"HILTI AG","THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER WOULD LIKE TO THANK HILTI AG FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP OF THIS RESEARCH.",NA,"0948-3349","INT.

DESPITE THEIR GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE, LAND USE IMPACTS ARE STILL RARELY ADDRESSED, ALTHOUGH METHODS FOR INTEGRATING LAND USE INTO LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED RECENTLY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT AND CALCULATION OF REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS BASED ON THE LANCA (R) (LAND USE INDICATOR VALUE CALCULATION IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT) METHOD TO BE INTEGRATED INTO LCA USING A GEO INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS). METHODS WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE LANCA (R) CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS (BOS ET AL. 2016), LAND USE IMPACTS CAN BE ASSESSED AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. HOWEVER, SOIL PARAMETERS AS WELL AS CLIMATIC CONDITIONS CHANGE ON A SMALL SCALE AND ARE VERY SITE-SPECIFIC. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS. AFTER A LITERATURE REVIEW, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIVE LANCA (R) INDICATORS. AFTERWARDS WE PRESENT THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE CALCULATION OF GIS-BASED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS AND APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO TWO EXAMPLES, THE INDICATORS OF MECHANICAL FILTRATION AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL FILTRATION. FINALLY, WE APPLY THE CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN A CASE STUDY. RESULTS, APPLICATION AND DISCUSSION THE REGION-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS ARE CALCULATED IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT YIELDING A MAP WITH VALUES FOR MECHANICAL FILTRATION AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL FILTRATION PER GRID CELL FOR VARIOUS LAND USE TYPES. A CASE STUDY SHOWS THAT LAND USE IMPACTS FLUCTUATE DUE TO SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS PEDOLOGICAL, TOPOGRAPHICAL AND CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT OUR CALCULATION OF REGIONALIZED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN GLOBAL MAPS IS FEASIBLE AND FACILITATES AN AREA'S POTENTIAL FOR CAUSING LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FOR A CERTAIN LAND USE COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS. REMAINING CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO INPUT DATA QUALITY, THE COMPREHENSIBILITY OF THE RESULTS TO PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE NOT LAND USE EXPERTS AND THE TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS OF LCA DATABASE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. CONCLUSIONS THROUGH THE PRESENTED REGIONALIZATION OF THE LANCA (R) FRAMEWORK, A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO METHOD ADVANCEMENT IS MET AS ALSO REGION-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS CAN NOW BE CALCULATED. IN COMPARISON TO THE PUBLISHED COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS IN BOS ET AL. (2016), THE DEVELOPED REGIONAL GIS-BASED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS ARE FAR MORE ADVANTAGEOUS ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS, IT HAS TO BE NOTED THAT AN LCA INCLUDING THE EVALUATION OF LAND USE DOES NOT REPLACE METHODS AND TOOLS LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. WHEN DECIDING ON A PREFERABLE LOCATION FOR A SPECIFIC LAND USE NATURE CONSERVATION, GEOGRAPHICAL, GEOLOGICAL AND BUILDING LAW ASPECTS MUST ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART; FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT; TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN",NA,"UBOS@SPHERA.COM",NA,NA,NA,"2024-12-24","10.1007/s11367-020-01730-y","MU9JB","1614-7502","FEB 2020",NA,"ERICH RITTER FOUNDATION","THIS WORK HAS BEEN PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE ERICH RITTER FOUNDATION.

THE DEMAND FOR IMPROVED ACCURACY AND CREDIBILITY OF LCA RESULTS HAS INCREASED THE NEED FOR LCI CONTAINING HIGHER DATA GRANULARITY AND QUANTIFIED UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS STUDY, A NOVEL DATA PROCESSING METHOD IS PROPOSED TO FACILITATE REGIONALIZED LCI DATABASE COMPILATION AND UNCERTAINTY CHARACTERIZATION. THE KEY STEP IN THE PROPOSED METHOD IS TO RETAIN VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS BY BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND TEMPORAL QUANTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS AND MATERIAL/ENERGY INPUT AMOUNTS USING MULTILEVEL MODELING (MLM) RATHER THAN LOSING THE VARIATIONS VIA A TRADITIONAL AGGREGATION METHOD. THE UNCERTAINTY IS OBJECTIVELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE MODEL PREDICTION INTERVAL. AN EXAMPLE CASE STUDY IS CONDUCTED ON NITROGEN FERTILIZER APPLICATION FOR CORN PRODUCTION WITH DATA COLLECTED IN 19 U.S. STATES FROM 1990 TO 2016. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ESTIMATES BY THE PROPOSED APPROACH ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN THOSE BY CURRENT AGGREGATION METHODS. FOR THE UNIT-YIELD-BASED INPUT AND UNIT-AREA-BASED INPUT, RESPECTIVELY, AROUND 60\% AND 80\% OF VARIATIONS WITHIN THE DATASETS ARE EXPLAINED BY MLM, AND 86.1\% AND 96.8\% OF THE UNREPRESENTATIVENESS FACTORS FOR THE MLM ESTIMATES ARE LESS THAN 0.2, COMPARED TO 62.3\% AND 70.5\% WHEN TRADITIONAL THREE-YEAR AGGREGATION IS USED. THE 95\% PREDICTION INTERVALS COVER MORE THAN 95\% OF MEASUREMENT DATA IN BOTH INPUT CASES.

UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS MODEL MEASURES AND OPTIMIZES THE CARBON EMISSIONS LEVEL OF THE SYSTEM FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY RESULTS INDICATE THAT CARBON EMISSIONS OPTIMIZATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT THE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION RESULTS. FROM A LIFECYCLE PERSPECTIVE, THE CARBON EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING RESULT IS ABOUT 9 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OBTAINED ONLY DURING THE OPERATION PHASE. COMPARED TO THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THE CARBON EMISSIONS OF THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED IN THIS STUDY DECREASED BY 82.75 \%. IN ADDITION, CONSIDERING THAT THE SYSTEM PROVIDES CHARGING SERVICES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, WHICH CAN REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY ABOUT 93.6 \% BUT ONLY INCREASE COSTS BY ABOUT 29.4 \%.

INVESTORS MAY HAVE ECONOMIC PLOT SIZE CONCERNS NOT CONSIDERED BY PLANNERS, TOURISTS MAY PREFER CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DEEP WATERS, AND URBAN PLANNERS MAY HAVE FAILED TO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CERTAIN PLOT RATIOS OR MINIMUM DIMENSIONS ETC. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A COMBINATION OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AND STATISTICAL TOOLS IS USED TO IDENTIFY AND MODEL THESE PROPERTIES. THE RESEARCH USES DATA FROM THREE DIFFERENT RESORTS IN TWO COUNTRIES ALONG THE RED SEA COAST (HURGHADA AND SAFAGA IN EGYPT AND JEDDAH IN SAUDI ARABIA). LANDSAT TM7 IMAGES ARE OBTAINED FOR EACH LOCATION AND ANALYSED TO DETECT REGIONS WITH THE LARGEST ALTERATION ALONG THE COAST USING THE POST-CLASSIFICATION CHANGE TECHNIQUE. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF EACH VILLAGE ARE GENERATED USING ARCGIS 9.2 BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ALTERATION. FINALLY, A PREDICTIVE DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR URBAN PLANNERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITORS IS FORMULATED USING STEPWISE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. FINDINGS: TWO-STEP CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND DISCRIMINATE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT ALTERATION TAKES PLACE BASED ON FACTORS THAT INCLUDE ORIGINAL WIDTH AND ORIGINAL DISTANCE TO DEEP WATER IN THREE DISTINCT GROUPS. THE PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT IS DEVELOPED CLASSIFIES ANY GIVEN RESORT INTO ONE OF THREE CLUSTERS, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR PHYSICAL DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS. THIS GIVES A ROUGH PREDICTION OF THE LIKELY ALTERATION THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE UNDER A GIVEN CONDITION. SUBDIVISION PLANS THAT IGNORE THE POWER OF THESE TWO FACTORS LITERALLY INVITE OWNERS TO VIOLATE SHORELINES AND ENCROACH ON THE SEA. PLANNERS ARE URGED TO JOIN HANDS WITH POLICY MAKERS AND DEVELOPERS TO FORMULATE GUIDELINES TO PLOT SUBDIVISION AND ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTABLE DESIGN SOLUTIONS TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO DEEP WATER. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: TILL NOW, THERE HAS BEEN NO METRIC TO RELATE A PLOT'S GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES WITH THE ENCROACHMENT IT MAKES. IF SUCH AN ASSOCIATION COULD BE MADE, A DEVELOPER'S RESORT PLANS MAY BE EVALUATED TO PREDICT THE DEGREE BY WHICH AN ENCROACHMENT IS LIKELY. THE MODEL CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY RESORTS WHOSE PROPERTIES PRESENT A RISK TO SHORELINES, DREDGE OR FILL TO MAXIMIZE USABLE LAND. TWO BENEFITS MAY BE THOUGHT OF FOR THIS APPROACH. FIRST, THE MODEL HELPS URBAN PLANNERS DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE COASTAL AREA BY BEARING IN MIND THE NEEDS OF TOURIST-DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR ADJACENT COAST.
