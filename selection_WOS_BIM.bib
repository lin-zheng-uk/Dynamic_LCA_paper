Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is relatively slow in China in the
   early 21st century, and its practical application was only used in one
   stage of a project. Accordingly, the specific application of BIM in each
   stage was analyzed based on the advantages and values of BIM, and then
   the BIM framework was established in the whole life cycle of
   construction projects. According to the situation of BIM in China and
   the successful experience of BIM development in other countries, the
   problems of BIM application in China were identified, and corresponding
   measures were put forward to ensure better implementation of BIM in the
   whole life cycle. This study would provide reference for promoting the
   application of BIM in the whole life cycle of construction projects in
   China.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM), as an effective digital method of
   information representation in the field of construction engineering,
   helps to deal with a series of works including design optimization,
   construction planning, and facility management. BIM enhances
   sustainability through energy simulations, material selection, waste
   reduction, and energy monitoring. However, challenges like talent
   shortage, interoperability issues, data management, and lack of
   standardization hinder its widespread use. Current research lacks
   systematic exploration of BIM's application in green buildings' life
   cycle, limiting further development. To fill this research gap, this
   study aims to provide a systematic review of the application of BIM in
   the design, construction and operation stages of the whole life cycle of
   green buildings. As a guideline to conduct this research, the preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model
   are used to identify the main procedures for literature screening and
   review. Through the systematic review, the main applications of BIM
   technology in green buildings are summarized, while the challenges in
   the current applications and the corresponding solutions are discussed.
   Finally, the study proposes key points for the future development of BIM
   to help the construction industry truly realize the development of man
   and nature and harmony and greenery.},

Title = {Sustainability-led design: Feasibility of incorporating whole-life cycle
   energy assessment into BIM for refurbishment projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Growing climate change challenges and increasingly strict sustainability
   standards have led to a significant growth in the need for building
   refurbishment projects which are essentially focused on retrofitting in
   order to make them low carbon, energy efficient and environmentally
   friendly. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) suggested that
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) should be used to achieve
   sustainability requirements during refurbishment projects as a
   correspondence to the National Audit Office (NAO) sustainability report.
   BIM is now widely advocated as the preferred tool for the management and
   co-ordination of design and construction data using object- oriented
   principles. The successful integration of environmental assessment into
   BIM for the whole of the construction lifecycle has not yet been
   achieved. The potential for using BIM in refurbishment projects
   specifically for achieving and managing sustainability requirements has
   not been yet critically reviewed or put into practice. This paper
   focuses on the use of BIM sustainability design tools in refurbishment
   projects, to achieve energy efficient buildings and achieve
   sustainability criteria for refurbishing non-domestic buildings. A
   critical lens is cast on the current literature in the domains of
   sustainable designs and the associated implications of the
   sustainability decision-support tools in BIM. The research also reviews
   the practicality of the existing sustainability decision-support tools
   that are currently used to assist with achieving environmental scheme
   certifications such as BREEAM and LEED for refurbishment projects.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of infrastructure construction, the
   requirements from public about the efficiency and quality of
   construction are increased as well. Building information modeling
   technology, as one of the most advanced information management method,
   is widely applied in engineering projects during the whole life cycle.
   The information generated by BIM system is in high quality, and those
   information or data could be managed effectively and reasonably by BIM
   technology. Meanwhile, the BIM system is a dynamic information sharing
   platform which could be updated by all participants. However, the
   application of BIM technology should combined with four main stages
   during the whole life cycle of the engineering project to achieve the
   delicacy management.},

Abstract = {Decision-making on whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon buildings is
   critical for addressing carbon emission and environmental problems.
   However, there is a lack of a data integration framework and an open
   international standard approach integrating key decision variables to
   support scientific computations and decision-making for whole-life-cycle
   net-zero-carbon buildings. Building information modelling (BIM) is an
   open international standard representing building information. Digital
   Twin (DT) can capture and monitor real-time building conditions to
   facilitate building operation. Integrating information acquired by DT
   with BIM has considerable potential to enable an open international
   standard based computational representation of key decision variables
   throughout the whole-building life cycle process. This paper aims to
   develop a novel conceptual framework that integrates BIM and DT to
   support net-zero-carbon buildings. The framework is developed using an
   open international standard approach and the ontology-based
   representation method, to define key decision variables using entities,
   properties, and relationships, and integrates captured data via DT. The
   research makes significant contributions to enable net-zero-carbon
   buildings and paves the way for future research on an automated system
   to support decision-making for the whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon
   buildings.},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The main aim of this research is to enhance the integration of life
   cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies with
   building information modelling (BIM), as existing approaches still have
   limitations (e. g. interoperability issues, non-editable databases). For
   that purpose, an automatic LCA/LCC analysis within a BIM-based
   environment is proposed. A BIM-based environmental and economic life
   cycle assessment (BIMEELCA) prototype tool was developed by the authors
   to improve the integration of BIM with LCA and LCC. Moreover, a pilot
   case study located in the Netherlands was used to validate the work
   developed in this research, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this
   approach for the construction industry. This study unveiled the
   potential of BIM-based simulations for the assessment of the
   environmental and economic impacts of buildings by integrating semantic
   information in the model. The work presented in this research is
   expected to contribute to the development of automatic sustainability
   simulations, creation of tailor-made BIM objects' libraries, and use of
   historical data contained within data-rich models for predictive
   analyses (i.e. analyses that identify the most suitable solutions based
   on the data from previous projects).},

Abstract = {The assessment of the environmental impacts related to the building
   lifecycle is a very complex issue because of the high number of
   variables involved. The aim of the research is to structure the
   information content into the Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   framework in order to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). An
   information flows matrix is developed through the investigation of the
   parameters responsible for the environmental impacts of buildings. Such
   information content is tested on a case study after implementing the
   proposed parameters into a BIM. The purpose is to verify that the
   identified parameters, implemented in the BIM environment, are
   sufficient to conduct the LCA. The results show that the proposed
   parameters could potentially improve the data reliability and
   consistency in the process of sharing information from the digital model
   to the LCA software. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The building physics research community is facing a challenge in
   evaluating the sustainability of modern buildings using digital tools
   and methods. Achieving carbon neutrality, the primary objective of the
   building industry, requires incorporating Industry 4.0 tools into
   current building evaluation procedures. To address this need, this
   research presents an Application Programming Interface (API) designed to
   facilitate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for entire buildings using
   information from Building Information Modelling (BIM) files. The study
   outlines the steps involved in developing a BIM-LCA API, including code
   development and validation with commercial software. The research
   identifies challenges in creating a uniform database platform for
   BIM-LCA, and the need for region-specific databases to provide automated
   material classification for measuring potential environmental
   consequences. The study also emphasizes the importance of establishing
   market-level sustainability standards through the development of
   relevant tools, training techniques, and procedures, and the need for
   national rating systems to align with these standards to achieve
   European climate adaptation and circularity goals. The assessment also
   identifies future challenges in the field and highlights the expected
   role of the European Union (EU) Level(s) sustainability scheme.},

Abstract = {The current building life cycle management system in the Russian
   Federation is a family of discrete subsystems that exist independently
   for different building life cycle stages. In this situation building
   reliability and sustainable functioning are out of the question. The
   implementation of a united information model (BIM-model) intended to
   describe building entire life cycle will allow to raise the
   sustainability, but this will happen only if goals and concerns of all
   participants of the project process are properly coordinated. An
   important figure of process sustainability is the organizational and
   technological reliability (OTR) that describes the possibility of a
   system to reach a goal. In case of building life cycle design, the
   economical efficiency of a building can be considered as the goal. The
   required technical, ecological, organizational, and other parameters
   form a complex of constraints that determine the area of allowable
   values for building functioning. In its broad meaning, OTR may be
   understood as the probability of receiving an economical effect based on
   the value of organizational and economical reliability (OER).},

Abstract = {The construction and building sectors are one of the highest consumers
   of resources and energy. Literature evidences the potentialities of the
   design phase towards the improvement of environmental, economic and
   social performance of buildings. Thus, the Life Cycle Sustainability
   Assessment (LCSA). approach is recognized as suitable method. It is
   based on the ``triple bottom line{''} principle, to calculate
   environmental, economic, social impacts produced by buildings during its
   life cycle. The present paper aims to present a methodological framework
   based on an LCSA, used during design stages of buildings and integrated
   into a building's design technology such as Building Information
   Modeling (BIM). A conceptual approach to conduct the data integration
   and a possible workflow to integrate the LCSA into BIM is proposed. The
   value of the present approach is the possibility to conduct quantitative
   environmental, economic and social assessment of buildings to guide
   designers to measure and predict the building's performance.},

Abstract = {BIM today is much more than drafting in 3D only, and project
   participants are further challenging, what is the topic of both this
   paper, and further research. Knowledge of objects, their behaviour, and
   other characteristics has high impact on whole building life cycle.
   Other structured and unstructured knowledge is rightfully added (e.g.
   historically based experience, needs and requirements of users,
   investors, needs for project and objects revisions) Grasping of all
   attributes into system for collection, managing and time control of
   knowledge. Further important findings lie in the necessity of
   understanding how to manage knowledge needs with diverse and variable
   ways, when BIM maturity levels are advanced, as defined by Bew and
   Richards (2008). All decisions made would always rely on good, timely,
   and correct data. Usage of BIM models in terms of Building Information
   Management can support all decisions through data gathering, sharing,
   and using across all disciplines and all Life Cycle steps. It
   particularly significantly improves possibilities and level of life
   cycle costing. Experience and knowledge stored in data models of BIM,
   describing user requirements, best practices derived from other projects
   and/or research outputs will help to understand sustainability in its
   complexity and wholeness.},

Abstract = {Purpose This research aims to propose a comparative environmental
   analysis of conventional and prefabricated construction techniques
   utilizing a building information modelling (BIM) technique.
   Design/methodology/approach A set of indicators are selected to assess
   the environmental emissions throughout the construction life cycle,
   based on BIM platform. An existing project involving ten apartment
   buildings in Shanghai is selected as a case study. Findings The results
   reveal that prefabricated construction demonstrates environment-friendly
   performance with some exceptions of acidification and mineral resource
   consumption. Environmental impacts can also be further reduced by
   increasing the projected area ratio and percentage of project
   prefabrication. Originality/value Overall, the proposed method can be
   used to identify relevant environmental merits and for decision-making
   of appropriate construction techniques in building construction
   projects.},

Abstract = {Adopting the Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology assists in
   fulfilling stringent cost and time objectives in architecture,
   engineering, construction and facility management industry. To enable
   further adoption of the technology a life cycle oriented approach needs
   to be pursued. In this work, information requirements for the whole life
   cycle of a building are defined and the capabilities of existing BIM
   models to assist the identified information areas are evaluated. The
   results indicate missing support on information about equipment
   efficiency curves, description of decentralized energy conversion
   devices, occupant behavior, thermal and visual indoor comfort and
   information on the preservation status. Furthermore, to support future
   BIM model development, the novel information management method GASCEeIiL
   is presented which allows tracing the use of a piece of information by
   each stakeholder along the information life cycle.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling begins to be perceived as the concept of
   ``covering all stages of the life cycle of a building{''}. A major flaw
   in this view is the fact that BIM is not actually perceived by all
   stakeholders as identical, and there is no single vocabulary, either in
   the form of a structured lexicon or in purely semantic understanding of
   many names and concepts used. Based on research findings BIM's focus on
   Building Information Management has proven to be a key part of BIM's
   success. As a result, it seeks to design a knowledge management system
   throughout the whole life cycle of the building as well as in the
   management of knowledge through partial projects. An essential part of
   BIM framework has identified the need to visualize knowledge and
   information. Based on other literature searches, ways of identifying
   knowledge, by deriving knowledge from information from experts, using
   shared models, are proposed. This derivation is directly driven by
   ontological identification and knowledge models based on taxonomy have
   been proposed. It leads to proposal of intelligent environment for team
   collaboration on projects or programs that probably require a suitable
   mix of different technology tools.},

Abstract = {The AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations)
   industry has raised a good deal of interest surrounding the use of BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) for project life cycle information
   management. Ideally the new development of BIM should make a full
   knowledge sharing between the facility management and design
   professionals unprecedentedly possible. But in reality different
   stakeholders of AECO projects are still working in their own silos and
   are afraid to collaborate with each other. This paper aims to identify
   the root causes of the ``information disintegration{''} issue in the
   AECO industry, which describes the lack of consolidation, unification
   and integration of building information over the project lifecycle and
   across different stakeholders. The options of bridging the knowledge gap
   between the design, construction, and operation phases by BIM have been
   investigated, as well as the need for data integration for facility
   management purposes. An in-depth case study is proposed to identify
   current problems pertaining to BIM utilization in facility management,
   in the areas of business processes, stakeholder perceptions and
   behaviors, and technologies.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework that integrates Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) with Genetic Algorithm Optimization and Monte-Carlo
   Simulation. The developed framework helps in implementing a stochastic
   Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) model for building to select the optimum building
   materials alternatives and discover the most influential building system
   in each cost element starting from initial cost to end on life cost.
   Genetic Algorithms Optimization technique is utilized to select the
   optimum alternatives of building systems taking in consideration
   sustainability aspects. The Monte-Carlo Simulation model is used as a
   fitness function for the optimization model. The environmental aspect of
   building is achieved by considering the maximum number of points that
   can be awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
   (LEED) rating system. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the optimum
   solutions that are chosen by optimization a model to examine the effect
   of different building systems on LCC and its components through
   computing the rank order of building systems and the target output. A
   case study is presented to demonstrate the practical features of the
   proposed framework. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In principle, Building Information Modelling (BIM) should provide a
   basis for infrastructure information management during the whole
   life-cycle. In practice however, the use of BIM is normally limited to
   the design and construction phases. It seems that the use of BIM
   information in other life-cycle stages requires significant changes in
   the way BIM models are developed. In order to explore this issue, three
   different approaches for integration of BIM and life cycle information
   management are discussed, illustrated by three projects: London
   Crossrail, the EU-project V-Con and an experimental project at Volker.},

Abstract = {In this paper uses of building information modeling (BIM) are
   investigated in a construction project in Finland. We analyze especially
   how the uses of BIM technologies mediated collaboration among project
   partners. Three main forms of collaboration are discerned on the basis
   of interview data: 1) BIM providing information, 2) BIM models
   instigating commenting and problem solving, 3) BIM models and
   information developed further with BIM. Examples of these forms of
   collaboration are presented as well related social and technical
   challenges. At the end, the BIM collaboration paradox is outlined, that
   is, BIM technologies seem both to reduce and add the need for social
   interaction.},

Title = {Whole life cycle environmental impact assessment of buildings:
   Developing software tool and database support for the EU framework
   Level(s)},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {188},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The European Commission has published a framework on the environmental
   sustainability of buildings, called Level(s), a set of indicators
   addressing the resource efficiency and environmental impact of
   buildings. This framework is now a key element of European initiatives
   to develop a circular economy and aims to address whole life cycle
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to drive a renovation wave for
   existing buildings. Analysis of the whole life cycle environmental
   impact of buildings, with an emphasis on GHG emissions, is also the
   focus of initiatives in several EU Member States. To support users,
   Level(s) was accompanied by a list of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   software tools and databases for calculating such indicators. A need was
   identified for prac-tical, user-orientated information about the scope,
   consistency, cost, and accessibility of LCA software tools and
   databases. Therefore, a list of LCA tools and databases used in Europe
   for the assessment of the whole life cycle environmental impacts of
   buildings was compiled in 2017-2020 and their characteristics analysed
   based on a set of criteria. This paper describes the policy context of
   Level(s) and discusses criteria that can be used for the
   characterisation of LCA software tools and databases from the list
   compiled for Level(s). The methods included a literature review,
   surveys/interviews, and the co-creation of criteria for the
   categorization of tools and databases. The results are criteria
   including construction-specificity, system boundaries \& scope,
   indicators, modelling granularity, methodological adherence to Level(s)
   and EN standards, data quality, transparency and verification,
   accessibility, data exchange and interoperability, cost, training and
   support, as well as additional information. By providing greater
   visibility regarding the features of tools and databases, this paper
   contributes to the main-stream use of Level(s) and also to the
   implementation of key EU policy initiatives aimed at enhancing the
   environmental sustainability of the built environment, such as the EU
   Renovation Wave, the New European Bauhaus, and the EU taxonomy for
   sustainable activities.},

Title = {EMBEDDING LIFE CYCLE COSTING IN 5D BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {145-167},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is the consideration of all `relevant' costs
   and revenues associated with the acquisition and ownership of an asset.
   LCC has a number of relevant applications, these include project
   appraisal; facilities management; procurement and tendering and as a
   means to evaluate sustainable construction. Although these advantages
   are well recognised, the process is underutilised due to a number of
   documented barriers to adoption. Notably these include lack of accurate
   historical databases; the perceived complexity and time consuming nature
   of the calculations; lack of a standard LCC methodology, and that
   clients are not requesting LCC. The research presented is framed in
   recognition of these barriers, investigating a process that could affect
   change by increasing efficiency in this area. A Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) approach to construction procurement is being
   increasingly utilised as a collaborative set of procedures and
   associated technologies that assist design and construction professions
   in conceiving, designing, constructing and operating the built
   environment. Although 5D BIM (Cost Modelling) is currently being used in
   Quantity Surveying (QS) practice, BIM is not extensively used in the
   application of LCC and there has been limited research in this area to
   date. The research demonstrates the development of a 5D BIM based LCC
   solution, where LCC is integrated into the 5D BIM process by embedding
   an LCC calculation model structure within an existing 5D BIM technology.
   This process represents a change to the 5D BIM workflow, adding on a
   facility for LCC through post-processing BIM data. The research is
   carried out under a design science research methodology, to develop and
   then evaluate the solution proposed. An evaluation method known as
   `Thinking Aloud cooperative evaluation' is used to gain feedback from a
   sample of QSs utilising the 5D BIM based LCC solution. The purpose of
   the evaluation is to gauge whether LCC can be effectively embedded in a
   5D BIM platform. The contribution to knowledge is the articulation of a
   process which extends 5D BIM for LCC, by leveraging an existing 5D BIM
   technology. The findings outline that the primary benefits of the
   proposed process/system is that it allows for a link between the QSs
   cost plans/BOQ's and their LCC calculations in an integrated
   environment.},

Title = {Life-cycle building information modelling (BIM) engaged framework for
   improving building energy performance},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {231},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The building sector is responsible for 32\% of global energy consumption
   and 19\% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent
   requirement for energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission
   reduction in the building sector has been recognised at the highest
   level of governments around the world. One potential solution, which has
   yet to be critically considered, is the application of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome building energy performance gap
   (BEPG), defined as the discrepancy between the designed and actual
   energy consumption in buildings. This study performs a systematic and
   comprehensive literature review to identify the specific causes of the
   BEPG, and then analyses the application of BIM for addressing the BEPG.
   A life-cycle BIM engaged framework was developed, including the function
   of ``information exchange{''}, ``design review{''}, ``energy-related
   quality control{''}, ``life-cycle commissioning{''}, and ``real-time
   operation and maintenance management{''}. It is expected that the
   proposed framework will assist researchers and practitioners better
   understand application of BIM to systematically improve building energy
   performance. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been significantly transformed by the
   implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which has
   facilitated extensive project management capabilities across the entire
   life cycle. Notwithstanding its advantages, there exist certain
   limitations that hinder its extensive implementation. This study aims to
   investigate the disparities related to the adoption of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) by conducting a thorough analysis of factors
   such as data interoperability, standardization, collaboration, skill
   gaps, and resistance to change. The data were collected through a
   preliminary pilot survey and a primary questionnaire. The collected data
   were then subjected to analysis using two statistical techniques:
   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Partial Least Squares Structural
   Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This study reveals noteworthy associations
   between the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and several
   crucial factors, including Continuous Integration (CI), Monitoring and
   Control (MC), Project Management (PM), Resolution and Performance (RP),
   Structural Management (SM), Sustainability Administration (SA), and
   Value Management (VM). This study provides valuable insights for
   professionals and policymakers, offering recommendations to enhance the
   implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advocating for
   additional research on complementary factors. Through the identification
   and subsequent resolution of recognized shortcomings, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) can be employed in a proficient manner to
   augment collaboration, mitigate costs, optimize energy efficiency, and
   implement sustainable construction methodologies. The present study
   makes a substantial contribution to the progress of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) adoption and the efficient management of construction
   project life cycles.},

Title = {Development of a BIM -based Environmental and Economic Life Cycle
   Assessment tool},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {265},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Currently, the built environment is one of the sectors that contribute
   the most to environmental impacts worldwide. As a result, the
   construction industry is increasingly adopting technologies and
   methodologies that promote the development of sustainable constructions,
   i.e. constructions that have low environmental, economic, and social
   impacts. Focusing on the environmental and economic impact of the
   construction, this research integrates the building information
   modelling (BIM) technology with the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life
   cycle costing (LCC) methodologies for the environmental and economic
   assessment of buildings. Building on the BIM-LCA/LCC framework and on
   the information delivery manual (IDM) and model view definition (MVD)
   for the BIM-LCA/LCC analysis, a BIM-based Environmental and Economic
   Life Cycle Assessment (BIMEELCA) tool is developed by the authors and
   detailed in this article. The BIMEELCA tool is used to support the
   decision-making process during early phases of a project and verify the
   feasibility of conducting automatic BIM-based LCA and LCC analyses in
   high-rise projects. A 250 m high-rise apartment, hotel, and office
   building is used to validate the usefulness of the tool at the early
   design stage. This case study demonstrates the feasibility to perform an
   automatic LCA and LCC analysis at this design stage by inserting in the
   model semantic information from generic databases. In the end, the
   benefits and limitations of the BIMEELCA tool are discussed. This
   research is expected to contribute to the promotion of semantically rich
   BIM models and the development of tailor-made BIM objects' libraries
   specific to the needs of companies.},

Abstract = {Building LCA needs detailed data of operational energy consumption,
   material and construction. Therefore, most case studies were conducted
   when the design schemes were well defined and developed. International
   researchers had made efforts in developing the methods and tools to
   improve building life cycle performances in the early design stage.
   Building Information Model (BIM) integrates multiple properties with 3D
   model which enables it to support information extraction and feedback
   during the design process and later in the building life cycle stages.
   In this contribution, the potential and methods of integration of BIM,
   LCA and Chinese building design process is discussed. First, the status
   quo of BIM and LCA of Chinese buildings are reviewed. Then, the
   advantages and limits of existing tools and databases are analysed with
   a case study. Finally, the need for developing the BIM enabled LCA tool
   and databases for Chinese building design workflows is explained.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of bridge construction, environmental
   concerns have become increasingly prominent. Low-carbon, green, and
   sustainable bridge engineering has emerged as an inevitable trend. A
   comprehensive carbon emission calculation system is key to achieving
   low-carbon bridges. This study proposes a rapid calculation and analysis
   system for bridge carbon emissions (Building Information Modeling-Life
   Cycle Assessment, BIM-LCA). This system, using the bridge information
   model as a carrier, calculates and manages data on material consumption,
   machinery, transportation, and energy throughout the bridge's life
   cycle. It then calculates the carbon emissions for each stage. This
   system simplifies the complex and cumbersome data collection and
   analysis processes found in traditional methods while also making the
   carbon emissions across the full bridge life cycle more accessible and
   visible. Being applicable to all types of bridges, this system can
   provide insights and a basis for decision-making in the early design
   stages and during construction and operation to support carbon
   reduction. Ultimately, it promotes low-carbon, environmentally friendly,
   and sustainable bridge engineering development.},

Abstract = {Sustainable procurement is an important policy for mitigating
   environmental impacts attributing to construction projects. Life-cycle
   cost analysis (LCCA), which is an essential requirement in sustainable
   procurement, is a principal tool for evaluating the economic efficiency
   for the total life-cycle budget of a building project. LCCA is a complex
   and time-consuming process due to repetitive complicated calculations,
   which are based on various legal and regulatory requirements. It also
   requires a large amount of data from different sources throughout the
   project life cycle. For conventional data management systems, data are
   usually stored in the form of papers and are input into the systems
   manually. This results in data loss and inconsistent data, which
   subsequently contribute to inaccurate life-cycle costs (LCCs). Building
   information modeling (BIM) is a modern technology, which can potentially
   overcome the asperities of the conventional building LCCA. However,
   existing BIM tools cannot carry out building LCCA due to their limited
   capabilities. The relational database management system (RDBMS) can be
   integrated with BIM for organizing, storing, and exchanging LCCA data in
   a logical and systematic manner. In this paper, a BIM-integrated RDBMS
   is developed for compiling and organizing the required data and
   information from BIM models to compute building LCCs. The system
   integrates the BIM authoring program, the database management system,
   the spreadsheet system, and the visual programming interface. It is part
   of the BIM-database-integrated system for building LCCA using a
   multi-parametric model. It represents a new automated methodology for
   performing building LCCA, which can facilitate the implementation of
   sustainable procurement in building projects.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of building demolition waste based on building
   information modeling},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sustainable building-demolition-waste management has become an important
   practice. Normally, three different methods of disposing of demolition
   waste should be considered: landfill, reuse, and recycling. The use of
   traditional documentation techniques for assessing the environmental
   impact of different disposal methods during the end-of-life (EOL) stage
   results in hundreds of detailed instruction sheets that need to be
   stored. In this study, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) framework is
   proposed for the evaluation and comparison of the environmental impacts
   of the three disposal strategies mentioned above in terms of factors
   such as the extraction of resources, loss of biodiversity, and effect on
   human health by using the information obtained with typical building
   information modeling (BIM). In the LCA framework, four
   environmental-impact-allocation types (namely, no, equal, mass, and
   economic allocations) are used to calculate the final impacts of the
   products to be shared by more than one product system. The results
   reveal that a particular disposal strategy should be investigated by
   considering an entire building to assess the effective reuse/recycling
   potential. In addition, a BIM-based plug-in (BIM-EF) is developed for
   the automatic appraisal of the environmental impact of buildings at the
   EOL stage by using Revit Add-in Manager. Two data libraries (the
   engineering quantity data library and environmental impact factor
   library) are created, and a coding system is established to connect the
   information stored in the BIM model and the two data libraries. Finally,
   the results of a case study are presented to illustrate the potential
   applications of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a new approach fo being able to
   describe and display the information required for design, construction
   and operation of buildings. More extended use of BIMS, with the
   development of Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs) for environmental
   assessments, energy calculations and LCC, ensuring more automatically
   data flow, between different data bases, calculation tools and Building
   Information Models (BIM), will simplify the use of LCC in design. More
   extended use of LCC, and storing the results for future use may also
   improve the Facility Management. Several projects have dealt with cost
   information flow, as information exchange between the BIM and LCC-tool
   and improving cost data bases, simplifying the data access as well as
   storage possibilities to ease and extend the use of LCCA. This paper
   will present the Current stage of file different project aiming at
   increased use of LCCA by use of BIM and IDMs.},

Abstract = {Being responsible for 38\% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the
   United States, the building industry is in need of a tool to assess and
   reduce its impact on environment and human health. This article presents
   a prototype software for 3D analysis of life cycle assessment (LCA) of
   the whole process of construction. By considering the whole life cycle,
   this approach avoids shifting environmental problems from one phase to
   another The accuracy of LCA substantially depends on the quality and
   availability of data from all phases of a building. To better manage and
   communicate data, presented prototype adopts industry foundation
   classes-based building information modeling, which also allows users to
   work with a 3D model of the building and analyze its environmental
   impact interactively.},

Abstract = {This study is to integrate the application of BIM used in different
   stages of project management. In the early design stage, BIM helps
   decision-making, costing budget, and information sharing, which benefit
   the following stages most. On the next construction stage, BIM has
   played an important role in assisting the project's construction
   process, avoiding construction risks, quality management, and components
   prefabrication and virtual assembly. When it comes to the later
   operation stage, BIM has numerous advantages: facility maintenance
   management, energy, and emergence management, change and relocation
   management, and safety management. However, there are still some
   limitations of BIM that are used in different stages of project
   management. The barriers of technical, personnel, and cost will have
   some adverse effects on BIM use. Therefore, BIM has played important
   role in the project management life cycle.},

Abstract = {The building sector has high environmental impacts such as significant
   energy consumption and waste generation, which demands the development
   of tools to assess and reduce the impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   enables the quantification of the environmental impacts but also faces
   difficulties of detailed information acquisition. The application of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers the possibility to simplify
   and optimize the LCA process on account of the abundant data stored in
   the 3D building model. Therefore, the BIM-LCA integration has a high
   potential. This paper aims to propose a holistic workflow framework of
   BIM and LCA based on the qualitative content analysis. The framework
   links four steps of the traditional LCA process, namely Goal and Scope,
   Life Cycle Inventory, Life Cycle Impact Assessment and Interpretations,
   with three components of the BIM process, namely Pre- BIM, Modelling and
   Collaborations, and Results Collection and Visualization, to streamline
   the BIM-LCA integration. Challenges and future research directions
   within the integration process are explored as well in this research.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the importance of exchanging relevant and reliable
   information in BIM (building information model) based software. The
   concept ``Life cycle Information Model{''} (LIM) is a framework for
   information relevant to specified phases of the building's life cycle,
   and is proposed in this paper. Software model objects / object libraries
   are proposed as the container for standardized professional information.
   Model objects with information are suggested to be named
   ``BIM-objects{''}. The AEC-industry should take the initiative for
   achieving a broad consensus about the selections of information that
   should be standardized in the BIM-objects. A ``BIM-object standard{''}
   can be based on the LIM framework. Content defined in BIM-objects can be
   included in development of IDM's (Information Delivery Manual) within
   different professional purposes. Correct use of BIM-objects during the
   building projects life cycle should be supported by BIM manuals.
   Improved exchange of information in BIM based software will support use
   of integrated design solutions, (IDS).},

Title = {Ontology of BIM in a Construction Project Life Cycle},

Abstract = {The paper deals with Building Information Modeling (BIM) on a general
   level. Upon literature and practice research, we discovered that BIM
   ontology has not been properly defined during project life cycle on the
   whole. There are various existing interpretations of BIM and related
   acronyms, but these interpretations only describe BIM from a specific
   perspective regardless to general relationships. This can result in
   problems and misunderstandings during communication, coordination and
   contracting. Research shows, that it is possible to understand BIM in
   three different ways: 1) BIM as a product, 2) BIM as a method and 3) BIM
   as a methodology. This paper also explores broader understanding of BIM
   as a methodology and proposes the correct BIM ontology we use
   schematics, and explain the role of BIM in traditional project life
   cycle phases. We propose strict differentiation between model and
   modeling, and we describe relationships between BIM and other IM (i.e.
   PIM, PLIM, CIM, DIM and AIM). Proposed ontology ought to be useful in
   both research and practice. In BIM standardization process, BIM
   implementation, and development of BIM related tools, it is necessary
   that all parties understand common ontology in the same way. In the end,
   the paper also summarizes the impact of research results and their
   possible use in practice. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Life Cycle Costing
   (LCC) of buildings into Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been a
   trending research area in construction management. The current practice
   has involved the combined use of BIM tools (such as Autodesk Revit, and
   Navisworks) for 3D building modelling, Building Energy Modelling (BEM)
   tools (such as EnergyPlus and DOE-2), and Environmental Impact
   Assessment (EIA) tools (such as Athena Eco-calculator, Tally and
   SimaPro, etc.) to conduct LCA of buildings. One of the major limitations
   observed in this approach is the interoperability (data loss) issues, as
   well as the complexity arising from employing many tools especially at
   the early building design stage. This paper is a critique of
   conventional BIM-integrated LCA of buildings. It proposes a real-time
   BIM-integrated LCA/LCC that allows the designer to get immediate
   feedback (on energy, carbon, LCC, and exergy) at key stages of the
   design process. It concludes that an improved approach is needed for
   BIM-integrated LCA/LCC adoption at the early design stage, which is when
   most of the sustainability decisions are made.},

Abstract = {Use of life-cycle costing (LCC) is a highly relevant method for
   determination of best value investment. LCC requires increased
   information compared to traditional building cost calculations. Use of
   building information modelling (BIM) based software should therefore
   lead to a high increase in LCC calculations for every project. However,
   this is not the case. The purpose of this study is to understand why
   BIM-based LCC calculations are not used more often. Integrated design
   and delivery solutions (IDDS) from CIB are used as a framework to
   explore practical use of LCC. IDDS focus on collaborating people,
   integrated processes and interoperable technology. This study is based
   on a combination of exploring BIM-based software, literature review and
   semi structured interviews with relevant stakeholders in building and
   civil engineering projects. The study identifies a gap between the
   process, the people, and the technology. Increased use of LCC
   calculations would benefit from increased integration rather than
   development of separate factors. IDDS has proven to be useful in
   understanding factors involved in practical use of BIM-based LCC
   calculations.},

Title = {A framework for building overhang design using Building Information
   Modeling and Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The development of computational tools and the ability to simulate a
   large amount of data in relation to a variety of climatic conditions has
   helped to make informed decisions about alternative solutions for
   bioclimatic building design. At the same time, the combination of
   advanced design models and tools such as Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) and environmental assessment methodologies such as Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) offer the opportunity for undertaking holistic
   technical, economic and environmental approaches for the environmental
   design of buildings. This study aspires to deliver a comprehensive model
   for the optimal computational design of building overhangs through the
   use of an integrated building information model. The analysis is
   implemented for different normalized shading projection geometries,
   different orientations and different climatic data, using
   well-established BIM and LCA tools. The energy intensity indicators of

Abstract = {Purpose Whole building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) is a key
   methodology to reduce the environmental impacts in the building sector.
   Research studies usually face challenges in presenting comprehensive LCA
   results due to the complexity of assessments at the building level.
   There is a dearth of methods for the systematic evaluation and
   optimization of the WBLCA performance at the design stage. The study
   aims to develop a design optimization framework based on the proposed
   WBLCA method to evaluate and improve the environmental performance at
   the building level. Design/methodology/approach The WBLCA development
   method is proposed with detailed processes based on the EN 15978
   standard. The environmental product declaration (EPD) methods were
   adopted to ensure the WBLCA is comprehensive and reliable. Building
   information modeling (BIM) was used to ensure the building materials and
   assembly contributions are accurate and provide dynamic material updates
   for the design optimization framework. Furthermore, the interactive
   BIM-LCA calculation processes were demonstrated for measuring the
   environmental impacts of design upgrades. The TOPSIS-based LCA results
   normalization was selected to conduct the comparisons of various
   building design upgrades. Findings The case study conducted for a
   residential building showed that the material embodied impacts and the
   operational energy use impacts are the two critical factors that
   contribute 60-90\% of the total environmental impacts and resource uses.
   Concrete and wood are the main material types accounting for an average
   of 65\% of the material embodied impacts. The air and water heating for
   the house are the main energy factors, as these account for over 80\% of
   the operational energy use. Based on the original WBLCA results, two
   scenarios were established to improve building performance through the
   design optimization framework. Originality/value The LCA results show
   that the two upgraded building designs create an average of 5\%
   reduction compared with the original building design and improving the
   thermal performance of the house with more insulation materials does not
   always reduce the WBLCA results. The proposed WBLCA method can be used
   to compare the building-level environmental performances with the
   similar building types. The proposed framework can be used to support
   building designers to effectively improve the WBLCA performance.},

Abstract = {In this research and innovation work, we propose an open and
   interoperable approach for exploiting the various building data
   collected across the different phases of a building's life cycle via a
   BIM-based Mixed Reality (MR) platform. Building information modelling
   (BIM) has gradually gained attention in recent decades and is widely
   considered a key to digitising and optimising the building life cycle.
   Yet, there are significant challenges in the standardization of
   methodologies, interoperability of solutions, and data exchange, as well
   as the usability of BIM-related solutions. Moreover, modern or renovated
   buildings produce extensive real-time data on top of the static data
   organised in BIM, and it is commonly accepted that most professionals in
   the field do not have access to the critical static or dynamic data that
   accompany a building project. Here, we exploit MR as an advanced user
   interface for enhanced interaction with building static and dynamic data
   instantiated by a BIM model, while we address a seamless conversion of
   BIM data to an online visual digital twin that supports the MR mobile
   application.},

Abstract = {The construction industry, as a traditional Chinese industry, its
   information construction level is obviously lower than other industries.
   In order to enhance construction productivity and reduce resource
   consumption, construction industry must be done for informational
   reform. The Building Life-cycle Management (BLM) and the Building
   Information Model (BIM) contain the abroad forerunner's technique of
   establishing and managing construction information, which realize the
   whole process management of the construction item and whole life span of
   the information. This paper introduces the basic circumstance of BIM and

Title = {Developing an automated BIM-based life cycle assessment approach for
   modularly designed high-rise buildings},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {90},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modular construction has attracted increasing attention due to its
   energy and environmental benefits. Digital technologies such as building
   information modelling (BIM) have also been explored to generate and
   manage data through the lifecycle of buildings. Although research has
   been performed in the area of integrating BIM and modular construction,
   BIM-based automated lifecycle assessment (LCA) of prefabricated
   buildings remains unexplored. This study therefore aims to develop a
   BIM-based LCA method for prefabricated buildings incorporating different
   assessment levels with unique system boundaries and functional units.
   The developed approach can support automated assessments through all
   lifecycle phases of a prefabricated building. It is achieved through an
   automated process of creating parameters to merge LCA data into the
   building model, systematic zoning, model setup and impact estimation.
   This approach is applied to evaluate the energy and environmental
   performances of a case building in Hong Kong. The case study validated
   the efficiency of the developed BIMbased LCA method in providing a
   systematic and detailed assessment of modularly designed buildings. This
   study extends the knowledge in automated BIM-based LCA by addressing
   specific characteristics of prefabrication and promotes the
   incorporation of comprehensive and detailed LCA data into BIM models for
   improved design robustness and holistic performances of buildings. This
   validated approach will enhance the willingness of designers to apply
   LCA during the design stages for minimizing the energy and environmental
   impacts of both new and renovated buildings with prefabrication.},

Abstract = {With inappropriate design or construction, the functions and service
   life of buildings begin to decline from the day of official use until
   they are demolished and resulting in extremely high cumulative cost
   throughout the building life cycle (BLC). However, the development of
   building information modeling (BIM) provides a solution for short BLCs
   and massive cumulative cost caused by errors occurring during the
   building design and construction phases. BIM is an innovative technique
   applicable to building design and construction management that has been
   vigorously developed in the construction industry. The development of
   BIM technology is now a global trend that can not be ignored, similar to
   2D CAD before. BIM can be further developed into several aspects and
   applied during the construction phase, most important of all, enhance
   the overall building functionality and save operating cost throughout
   the BLC.},

Title = {BIM-enabled life cycle assessment of concrete formwork waste reduction
   through prefabrication},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Although prefabrication is considered a sustainable construction
   technology that can reduce various construction waste, research on its
   potential for concrete formwork waste reduction is currently limited.
   This study proposes an approach integrating life cycle assessment (LCA)
   and building and information modelling (BIM) to quantify the possible
   life-cycle formwork waste reduction through prefabrication from a
   construction project, in which LCA serves as a systematic assessment
   framework and BIM provides the basic inventory for LCA. A typical
   reinforced concrete frame structural building located in Nanjing, China
   is chosen for a case study to demonstrate and validate the proposed
   approach. Results show that prefabrication can reduce formwork waste by
   59.68\%-71.83\%, which mainly comes from straight walls and slabs. This
   figure can continuously increase to as high as 90\% if the
   prefabrication is further applied and promoted. Findings from this study
   contribute to the understanding of the environmental benefits of
   prefabrication. This is of great significance for designers, engineers,
   and governments who are constantly seeking ways toward sustainable
   construction.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that building information modeling (BIM)
   and life-cycle assessments (LCAs) could be integrated to quantify and
   alleviate the environmental effects of buildings while simplifying and
   optimizing data acquisition. However, there has been no expert-based
   research into the true potential of BIM-based LCAs in a wider context
   with consideration of the advantages and disadvantages. This study aims
   to identify, classify, and prioritize these advantages and disadvantages
   using mixed methodological research and subject matter experts (SMEs).
   This includes a comprehensive literary review, semi-structured
   interviews with SMEs, and use of the Delphi method. A total of 21
   advantages and 7 disadvantages associated with BIM-based LCAs were
   identified and classified. The advantages were grouped into four
   categories: decision making, material selection, sustainability
   performance, and waste reduction. The disadvantages were grouped into
   two categories: standardization and data processing. The Delphi method
   was applied via two rounds of questionnaires with ten SMEs to prioritize
   the advantages and disadvantages. The results of this study will provide
   practitioners and researchers with constructive information for the
   integrated use of BIM and LCAs and will create awareness in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The identified
   disadvantages show the requirements for future work and the priority
   rankings for both the advantages and disadvantages could be used by
   researchers and key stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is being increasingly accepted by
   the building industry as an innovative method for integrating many
   different data related to a building. Part of this data concerns
   performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy
   consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus
   of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building
   design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that
   reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view
   of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in
   the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different
   risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into
   a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first,
   integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into
   the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating
   uncertainty and computing risk metrics. Finally, the evaluation of risk
   levels is supported by the use of semantic web technologies through a
   risk ontology. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier},

Abstract = {Whole Building Life-Cycle Assessment is a methodology whose importance
   has been steadily growing in the construction industry, as a reliable
   way to assess the environmental impacts of a building through its whole
   life-cycle. Life-Cycle Assessment is used by designers, architects,
   manufacturers, and consultants for various purposes: eco-design, the
   achievement of Green Building certifications, including DGNB DK, and
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). This paper will examine the
   current advantages and challenges of performing Life-Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Life-Cycle Costing (LCC) calculations in the building sector
   based on the results of 41 survey responses and 110 interviews conducted
   between 2016 and 2017. The survey indicated that 86.5\% of respondents
   believe that the integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in
   the automation of Life-Cycle Assessment calculations will allow LCA to
   be used effectively during the building design process. Also, according
   to our interviewees, the integration of LCA and LCC is a considered
   valuable approach for building sustainability but it is mainly driven by
   green building certifications. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Green Building Rating Systems and Whole-Building Life Cycle Assessment:
   Comparative Study of the Existing Assessment Tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is a growing interest in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA)
   into building design decision making due to LCA's comprehensive and
   systemic approach to environmental evaluation. Many green building
   rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a
   comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools
   available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for
   a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary
   in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices),
   design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA
   tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early
   design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of
   materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others
   showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the
   beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated
   that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and
   the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case
   study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational
   energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as
   increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to
   mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing
   the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the
   operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed.
   Finally, this paper examines the traditional building's systems that are
   usually involved in LCA and the possibility of adding other systems,
   such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems, using building
   information modeling (BIM). (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {The research addresses the issue that there is no an integrated approach
   or model to activate and implement sustainability in a project
   throughout its life and not benefit from the potentials of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) technology in achieving and supporting all
   sustainability aspects as a human need. Therefore, the research aims to
   establish and achieve a Sustainable BIM Model for applying within
   projects throughout their life cycle, managing the relationship between
   BIM and sustainability, and obtaining best interoperability performance.
   Consequently, sustainability and the potentials of dealing with it by
   modern techniques and tools were investigated and identified to simulate
   its indicators and criteria. Besides, strategies to establish
   sustainability that can be activated. Then related sustainability
   indicators to the performance of project aspects were collected and
   categorized to facilitate linking with BIM platforms. Moreover, the
   potentials of the overlap between sustainability and many BIM platforms
   were examined and demonstrated, and their employability in supporting
   sustainability aspects in a balanced manner. Eventually, a methodology
   to manage the relationship between BIM and sustainability was deduced
   and formulated to achieve a Sustainable BIM Model during a building life
   cycle.},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is an effective tool in
   determining the environmental impact of buildings. However, the LCA
   process requires extensive time and effort when applied to systems as
   complex as the life cycle of buildings. The development of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) Platforms offers interesting opportunities to
   simplify the process for drawing up LCAs in the case of buildings.
   Recent research shows that the use of BIM-based methods leads to a
   significant reduction in time and effort which practitioners dedicate to
   applying the LCA methodology to entire buildings. LCA phases such as
   Life Cycle Inventory, traditionally extremely time-consuming, is almost
   self-operating when BIM resources are in use. The level of automation of
   LCA elaboration could be optimized by using a) the programming
   possibilities within the BIM platform framework; and b) the
   standardization of the models for analysis. In the last few years there
   has been significant progress in these two fields, based on a line of
   research proposed by the Master's in Innovation in Architecture:
   Technology and Design in the University of Seville. There has been a
   considerable development of programming software integrated in BIM. Many
   regions have encouraged countries to use BIM platforms when documenting
   the construction process. This new conceptual framework provides the
   opportunity to assess the life cycle of numerous buildings in terms of
   the environment, obtaining specific environmental benchmarks for the
   different types. This communication describes a method proposed to
   obtain specific environmental benchmarks, - such as global warming
   potential and cumulative energy demand - for different types of
   dwellings using LCA methodology and BIM platforms. The application of
   this approach to different case studies is presented. The case studies
   selected for this research are those of housing located in different
   geographical and climate contexts and using different constructive
   systems (e.g. masonry construction, wood construction, steel
   construction). Finally, this paper provides the benchmarks resulting
   from the application of the proposed method to the case studies.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of life cycle assessment (LCA) in inspecting
   environmental impacts, its execution through manual methods affects the
   quality of the results, besides consuming the time and effort of
   decision-makers in the construction industry, such as designers,
   implementers, facility managers, and consultants. When LCA relies on
   building information modeling (BIM), it encounters many difficulties and
   obstacles, such as human intervention, conflicts among platforms and
   environmental databases, and no coordination to integrate or manage
   information. Thus, the research aims to support LCA through automatized
   integration with BIM depending on BIM's role in information management,
   promoting decisions, and activating BIM implementation success factors
   to make the BIM model qualified for the LCA. Then, the BIM and LCA
   overlap methods were analyzed and exemplified. Also, the requirements of
   their integration strategies were identified for LCA to become automated
   from now. Accordingly, the process map that supports and coordinates the
   automatized integration of LCA and BIM, overcomes integration
   difficulties, and conducts LCA through automated methods was deduced and
   structured. The analytical hierarchy process was applied through the
   survey using questionnaires and interviews to validate this map. The
   survey affirmed that the BIM model acquired new characteristics and will
   play an essential role in the LCA's accuracy, reliability, and
   comprehensiveness. This map supports the standardization and alternative
   strategies of the workflow. Furthermore, the interconnected stages of
   this map as a scenario can conduct an LCA within any project's life
   stage and guarantee its quality.},

Title = {Drivers of BIM-Based Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Buildings:
   An Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) for life cycle sustainability
   assessment is an emerging development considered valuable given its
   importance in enhancing the environmentally friendly performance of
   buildings by delivering eco-efficient structures. However, despite its
   benefits, adoption is low. Thus, this study examines the key drivers of
   a building's BIM-based life cycle sustainability assessment. An
   interpretive structural modelling approach and Matrice d'Impacts
   croises-multipication applique a classement (MICMAC) analysis were
   adopted for this study. Nineteen key drivers were categorized into a
   seven-level ISM model, which revealed that the successful implementation
   of the driving factors for BIM-based LCSA would increase its adoption
   and encourage users to be proactive in exploring solutions, exerting
   best efforts, and advancing its usage. The primary drivers, such as
   organizational readiness, personal willingness to use, procurement
   methods, and organizational structure, amongst others, are crucial for
   discussing BIM-based LCSA adoption strategies and making guidelines and
   design decisions to guide the process. This paper therefore contributes
   to the growing discussion on BIM from the viewpoint of an assessment of
   a building's life cycle sustainability. The study concludes that
   organizational, governmental, and institutional support, as well as
   capacity development, are essential to driving BIM-Based LCSA.},

Abstract = {Previous research indicates that Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   serves as a digital platform for integrating pertinent data across all
   stages of construction, enhancing data management capabilities. This is
   notably crucial during initial investment planning and throughout
   project execution, facilitating efficient engineering information
   management, practice, quality assurance, and cost control concurrently.
   BIM contributes novel insights into green building development while
   posing significant challenges. The complexity of optimizing multiple
   performance indicators using BIM has hindered its widespread adoption in
   design practice, confining its application primarily to academic
   research. Therefore, this paper reviewed 168 previous studies from the
   past ten years, conducted an in-depth review and comparison, and
   provides suggestions for possible future research direction for BIM
   research. Specifically, the paper systematically reviews the application
   of BIM in design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofit and
   demolition, and all the assessment phases of green buildings, and
   discusses the advantages of the BIM application in green buildings as
   well as an analysis of the current research gaps. This research enhances
   practitioners' understanding of BIM and green buildings' current trends
   and development status. It elucidates BIM's role in fostering green
   building development, guiding future industry professionals and
   researchers in effectively integrating BIM into sustainable construction
   practices.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) and the digital exchange of
   information in the construction industry is growing rapidly. Objects and
   their information are being exchanged in the supply chain and the
   lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur. Information is
   defined and interpreted differently by the different parties. Automated
   exchange of information in the industry is therefore not possible. The
   Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide national cooperation
   between partners in the total building sector, have set the ambition to
   create a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL): ``one language for the building
   sector{''}. Based on the concept of ``distributed libraries{''}, the
   library will be tuned to other international and national libraries and
   classification systems. Creating this common language in a combined
   national effort will be beneficial for all partners: More efficient
   exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire
   supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer's
   design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures
   arising from misinterpretation. This paper describes the principles of
   the CB-NL and how this will help to make BIM-models for the life cycle
   of the build environment.},

   Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is receiving ever-increasing attention and is
   utilized by many construction companies in their current practices. This
   paper aims at a critical investigation of the impact of VR technology on
   how sustainability and cost are understood and perceived by the users in
   building design projects, which could lead to improving and supporting
   the actual building design processes. The research study focused on
   evaluating design alternatives using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)-enabled VR technology integrated with cost and sustainability life
   cycle assessment (LCA) software. In doing so, the paper begins with
   reviewing the relevant literature in the mentioned areas. Thereafter, it
   adopts an experimental-qualitative-quantitative method to test the
   research hypothesis and analyze the effects of 360-degree VR on the
   users (66 participants), while distinguishing between users who have a
   relevant background in building/construction engineering (i.e.,
   architect engineers and civil engineers), and those who have not (i.e.,
   owners and clients). It is observed that despite their background, the
   user participants positively embrace the ideas and aspirations of
   sustainability, and that there is some evidence of respondents
   preferring the economy over sustainability. Likewise, the participants
   are not making an effort to measure the emissions of their design
   options rather than focus on the building's economic aspects.},

Title = {Life-cycle information management using open-standard BIM},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {696-708},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a way of working with
   open-standard building information modeling (BIM), object type
   libraries, systems engineering and an Information Delivery Manual for
   the management of information over the life-cycle of infrastructure
   assets. The concept is presented as a source of inspiration, proof of
   concept and to underpin the value of different parts of the concept
   leading to an integrated approach to life-cycle information management.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a concept for a way of
   working. A proof of concept is provided in the form of a case study in
   which this concept is operational. It shows that this way of working
   using open-standard BIM can be applied to manage information in the
   life-cycle. It does not provide, nor suggest to provide, empirical
   evidence for specific benefits in terms of efficiency.
   Findings - The paper shows that open-standard BIM can be applied for
   information management in the life-cycle of (construction) assets. The
   specific approach that is applied in practice in a Dutch Infrastructure
   Project is explained including a case project.
   Research limitations/implications - The example of Traverse Dieren
   attests to a implementation of the approach in practice. From this case
   it can be concluded that the suggested approach is feasible in the
   initiation and design phase and applicable during realization. Based on
   the example as described in this paper it cannot be concluded to what
   extent the known information management problems in the life-cycle are
   solved. Therefore a detailed evaluation on the information exchange
   would be required which is beyond the scope of this paper.
   Practical implications - This paper shows how different (theoretical)
   concepts are successfully combined and implemented in practice to attain
   the defined BIM goals.
   Originality/value - This paper shows a practical case implementation of
   open-standard BIM (using COINS). It provides a way of working that
   combines BIM, systems engineering, libraries and contractual
   arrangements for the management of information over the life-cycle of
   infrastructure assets.},

   information modeling for life-cycle management of durability performance},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Extending the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools
   into the operation and management phases of a building's life cycle is a
   significant advance in recent years. However, few studies have
   investigated or developed tools for the life-cycle management of
   durability performance of built structures leveraging BIM. This gap is
   partly due to (i) the lack of an accessible interface that connects BIM
   software with durability models of built structures, and (ii) no
   available durability models that are fundamental in nature and thus can
   integrate with other tools. To begin addressing this gap, this paper
   presents a framework that uses the Application Programming Interface
   (API) within BIM to integrate physics-based durability performance
   models, which extends the application of BIM into the post-construction
   phases by enabling more accurate predictions of life cycle performance.
   An application of the framework is presented for analysis and management
   of a reinforced concrete structure.},

Abstract = {The climate debate necessitates reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
   buildings. A common and standardized method of assessing this is life
   cycles assessment (LCA); however, time and costs are a barrier. Large
   efficiency potentials are associated with using data from building
   information models (BIM) for the LCA, but development is still at an
   early stage. This study investigates the industry practice and needs for
   BIM-LCA, and if these are met through a prototype for the Danish
   context, using IFC and a 3D view. Eight qualitative in-depth interviews
   were conducted with medium and large architect, engineering, and
   contractor companies, covering a large part of the Danish AEC industry.
   The companies used a quantity take-off approach, and a few were
   developing plug-in approaches. Challenges included the lack of quality
   in the models, thus most companies supplemented model data with other
   data sources. Features they found valuable for BIM-LCA included visual
   interface, transparency of data, automation, design evaluation, and
   flexibility. The 3D view of the prototype met some of the needs,
   however, there were mixed responses on the use of IFC, due to different
   workflow needs in the companies. Future BIM-LCA development should
   include considerations on the lack of quality in models and should
   support different workflows.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to propose correction methods for building
   information modeling (BIM)-based estimations of major building material
   quantities in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Major building materials were
   analyzed that could be modeled using Levels of Detail (LODs) via BIM and
   defined the LODs that were to be used in LCA. Different correction
   methods for the supply quantity of each of the major building materials
   were proposed using the waste factor method, reinforcement factor
   method, and standard quantity method, and their applicability were
   examined in a case study. As a result, the values of all major building
   materials quantities to which correction methods were applied were
   closer to the supply quantities in actual structures than were the
   BIM-based values.},

Abstract = {In the early building design stage, there are numerous uncertainties due
   to the lack of information on materials and processes. Designers
   therefore cannot quantify the environmental impacts of buildings in
   order to evaluate the environmental performance of their designs early
   on. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) and building information
   modeling (BIM) are carried out in the early and detailed building design
   stages. The method is applied to a residential building in Quebec,
   Canada. The BIM is conducted with Revit, and the LCA with openLCA. To
   prepare the Revit outputs as the appropriate inputs of the LCA model, a
   functional database was developed. It includes all building assemblies,
   layers and possible materials commonly found in residential buildings in
   Quebec. The ecoinvent database was used to source of life cycle
   inventory (LCI) data for each material. To manage information
   uncertainty in the early design stage, a probability function was
   assigned to each material. At the detailed design stage, all material
   types and quantities were specified in BIM file, which was used in the
   LCA study. The environmental impacts of the building stages and
   assemblies were calculated to determine the best building assembly
   options from an environmental perspective-a process that could guide
   building designers in the environmental assessments of their designs,
   making it possible to select more sustainable materials for each
   assembly and thus reduce the environmental impacts of the building.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to develop, test and summarise lessons
   learned using two different methods for data integration between
   autonomous software packages for design models, cost calculations and
   cost databases with regard to generating life-cycle costing analysis.
   The two developed methods followed the principles of compatibility and
   interoperability and were tested in three test cases: a simplistic
   design model, a university building model and a private company's office
   building model. The compatible method entailed an MS Excel tool while
   the interoperable method followed a more automated procedure through a
   visual programming environment. Both methods were, however, facing
   several obstacles with regard to data integration across autonomous
   software packages and automated procedures for calculation of life-cycle
   cost which in turn left plenty of manual work and made the results prone
   to human errors.},

   scenarios of a residential building},

Abstract = {This study pinpoints the benefit of integrating Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Building information modelling (BIM) for different design
   scenarios of a residential building's structural system; (1) reinforced
   concrete solid slab system, (2) steel and (3) composite structural
   system. The environmental impacts for each scenario are evaluated,
   providing insights into the contribution of (1) building life cycle
   stages, (2) structural systems and (3) building materials. Construction
   cost and time were also assessed and compared for each. The results show
   how LCA-BIM integration can streamline the environmental stewardship and
   prioritize action; showing that the building operation stage, the steel
   structural system, slabs and beams as well as reinforced concrete have
   the highest environmental impact, respectively. Hence, this calls for
   acting on building operation as well as the proper design of building
   elements and selection of building materials to reduce the associated
   environmental burden resulting from the building process. (c) 2022 THE

Title = {REDUCTION OF THE BIM DIMENSION OF THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF BUILDING AND
   FACILITIES},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2021},
Number = {4},
Pages = {95-105},
Abstract = {Statement of the problem. The subject of the research is information
   models of a complete life project in the sector of architecture, design
   and construction and maintenance of buildings and structures. The
   purpose of the research is to optimize BIM technologies by building a
   model based on a discrete vector data description.
   Results. Analyzed the main obstacles to the widespread introduction of
   BIM technologies and procedures for the full life cycle of a
   construction project in the practice of the construction complex of the
   Russian Federation throughout the entire life cycle of the project,
   including the stages of construction, operation and disposal, as well as
   global trends in this process. The method of BIM dimension reduction
   based on discrete vector data description is formulated. The technology
   of forming a hierarchical dynamically added and updated information base
   BIM, taking into account the possibility of its aggregation, has been
   developed. The algorithms proposed in this work are implemented in the
   shell of a relational database management system.
   Conclusions. BIM dimension reduction, based on a discrete vector
   description of data, allows you to completely solve the problems of both
   designing and updating the BIM information base, and its transfer
   between project participants. BIM data formats are determined by the
   stage of the complete project life cycle. Fully functional for the stage
   of determining the scope of work on a project, BIM is one-dimensional
   and is simply determined by the vector of clusters of a lower degree of
   integration, which allows you to completely overcome all obstacles to
   the widespread introduction of BIM technologies and procedures of the
   full life cycle of a construction project into practice. The optimal
   shell for the implementation of BIM technologies is relational
   databases.},

Abstract = {Buildings management along with its life cycle is currently an issue
   that requires a great optimisation considering the high cost associated
   with the buildings use and due to the operation and maintenance costs.
   The number of existing buildings needing refurbishment actions justify
   the need of an intervention model that optimise its service life after
   the refurbishment process. So, a refurbishment, maintenance and costs
   planning should be established and guided by value for money principles.
   The aim of this paper is to analyse the application of Buildings Life
   Cycle Management (BLCM) to a case study under a refurbishment process,
   to study the specific solutions and to assess the correspondent service
   life using the factor method according the ISO 15686 family. With this
   study, was possible to assess solutions and refurbishment conditions in
   terms of durability, when compared between the different proposals. In
   order to improve the case study Building Life Cycle maintenance, in
   addition, was applied Building Information Modelling (BIM), as BLCM is
   connected with BIM in order to highlight the importance of their
   inter-relationship. This study concludes about the most advantageous
   type of maintenance, how BIM can contributes to BLCM and how can improve
   maintenance plans.
   Thus, this study contributes to highlight the importance of preventive
   maintenance, to promote its implementation and consequently, to use
   maintenance plans reducing life cycle cost and increasing materials
   service life.},

Abstract = {Owners and construction management are in permanent search to increase
   competitiveness, reduce cost and time and maintain a high quality of
   products and services. In this objective project management tend to
   organize work execution by implementing comprehensive, linked and
   sequential processes, making full use of every work effort and limiting
   work duplication and rework. Since the `90s, the 3D-modeling is used to
   coordinate, plan, build and manage future structures. The BIM approach
   proposes to stakeholders to participate in an intelligent centrally
   shared 3D-model making use of every contribution to this model,
   facilitating the coordination, solving the interfaces, reducing
   duplication efforts and carrying the developed data information
   throughout the life cycle of the structure and beyond the construction
   phase. Completing a complex structure requires an important level of
   design management and coordination of the interface between architect,
   designer, mechanic, electrician, and other designers. Basic input is
   required from equipment suppliers. Now, for a good reason, everyone in
   charge of the process is focused on achieving their process with less
   cost and less time. Thus, he inadvertently reduces the effort associated
   with surrounding or subsequent actions, and focuses on his main result.
   For example, structural engineering developing a 3D-model will focus on
   clean structural design focusing on structural continuity, geometry
   identification, and calculation model for finite elements of software.
   Likewise, a mechanical engineer will model plumbing and mechanical
   networks for fabrication and installation purposes. It is the same with
   other design disciplines.},

Title = {Life cycle energy analysis of buildings: A systematic review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {252},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Buildings consume a significant amount of energy and resources during
   all stages of their life cycle, causing enormous environmental impacts.
   Life cycle energy analysis is a holistic approach to estimating the
   energy performance of buildings with respect to their designed energy
   efficiency. This paper aims to ascertain the state of research on the
   life cycle energy analysis of buildings to formulate a strategic
   framework for reducing the energy footprint of the building sector. The
   study is conducted through the explorative method of research using a
   systematic review approach. The material for the systematic review is
   selected from five scientific databases through a rigorous and
   structured process. Findings indicate that the current methods of life
   cycle energy estimation are tedious and resource-intensive, requiring
   numerous, incomplete inventory databases and energy simulation tools
   that require a user interface. Moreover, the lack of explicit guidelines
   or standards for life cycle energy estimation causes large variations in
   the results, thus making the comparison between different studies
   unrealistic. Further, recent trends reveal the use of methods such as
   the multi-regional input-output method, multi-objective optimisation,
   multi-criteria decision-making, data analytics, and the increasing
   relevance of building information modelling (BIM) for energy
   calculations and evaluation of design alternatives. The review points to
   the urgent need for developing a comprehensive and integrated knowledge
   base and standards for life cycle energy analysis of buildings, starting
   from the early design stage. Finally, the study proposes a strategic
   framework for reducing energy demand in the building sector for
   stakeholder implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of building information modeling
   ( BIM) and life-cycle cost ( LCC) analysis in the development of a
   BIM-game prototype. The authors address the interoperability of the game
   engine and use LCC analysis to enhance visualization and education.
   Inexperienced owners or stakeholders have difficulty understanding the
   relationship between initial cost and LCC, and therefore typically
   choose the initial value, which seems economical from their point of
   view. The primary objective of this paper, however, was to create a
   BIM-game prototype that helps owners, stakeholders, or students
   visualize and quickly understand the relationship between LCC and
   initial cost. To this end, the authors create a BIM-game prototype that
   integrates BIM with a game engine simulation ( i. e., Unity 3D) into an
   LCC analysis visualization. The BIM-game prototype allows users to
   navigate their building environments with the capability of simulating
   the LCC. The elements of the system are a combination from among many
   fields including architecture, engineering, computer programming, and
   game development. These elements connect various areas such as building
   modeling, animation, navigation, and collision detection. Changing the
   materials and adding construction accessories simultaneously improved
   the LCC and the interaction of game engine controllers and the player's
   interface. Finally, the authors developed a survey to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the BIM-game prototype. The results show significant
   potential for using the system in future projects.},

Title = {Multidisciplinary Optimization of Life-Cycle Energy and Cost Using a
   BIM-Based Master Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Virtual design tools and methods can aid in creating decision bases, but
   it is a challenge to balance all the trade-offs between different
   disciplines in building design. Optimization methods are at hand, but
   the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain
   models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one
   source instead of having several unconnected product definitions.
   Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing
   the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability
   between models from different domains and previous research reports on
   different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent
   research features BIM-based optimization, but there is still a question
   of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats
   to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost.
   This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary
   optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model,
   from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and
   evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the
   optimization loop. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was
   developed and used in a case study of a Swedish multifamily residential
   building to test the framework's applicability in generating and
   optimizing multiple models based on the BIM-model. The prototype was
   developed to enhance the building's sustainability performance by
   optimizing the trade-off between the building's life-cycle energy (LCE)
   and life-cycle cost (LCC) when choosing material for the envelope. The
   results of the case study demonstrated the applicability of the
   framework and prototype in optimizing the trade-off between conflicting
   objectives, such as LCE and LCC, during the design process.},

   and weighted evaluation of the results generated by the BIM-LCA function
   module (Tally), the impact potential of different environmental impact
   types in each stage and the environmental impact size of the same
   environmental impact type in different stages are obtained. The analytic

Title = {An Actor-Network Approach to Developing a Life Cycle BIM Maturity Model
   (LCBMM)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) has considerable potential for
   addressing sustainability issues in construction, but its benefits can
   be constrained by the failure to adopt BIM across the full project life
   cycle. Systematic whole-of-life BIM adoption can be supported by
   maturity models, but most models are limited by a lack of theoretical
   grounding, socio-technical dichotomies and the failure to adequately
   consider the full asset life cycle, often by overlooking the operations
   phase. This study aims to (1) develop a BIM maturity model that
   addresses these limitations by (2) using an in-depth analysis of an
   early adopter case study, thus addressing the lack of empirical research
   in BIM adoption experiences. A single interpretive research study was
   conducted to qualitatively analyse a US-based university. The data were
   gathered through interviews, field visits and document analysis.
   Actor-network theory (ANT) concepts scaffolded the analytical approach.
   The findings show that a complex BIM socio-technical network emerged,
   developed and converged during the project management stage but
   struggled to achieve durability as an ongoing solution to facilities
   management. By analysing the elements of success and failure across each
   stage, the researchers distilled five key lessons to achieve
   whole-of-life BIM maturity and proposed a life cycle BIM maturity model
   (LCBMM) supported by a practice guide.},

Abstract = {Connectivity is key in this new era of smart infrastructure. Smart
   airports utilize new connected technologies to improve end-user
   experience while ensuring operational feasibility in aeronautical and
   non-aeronautical segments. The increasing need for digitizing the
   design-build-operate life cycles of airports can be met by implementing
   building information modeling (BIM) that enables accessing, managing,
   utilizing, and connecting physical and operational data in a digital
   collaborative environment. This study investigates the current state of
   practice in airport BIM (ABIM) and the use of ABIM processes in digital
   airport operations and maintenance by connecting existing data sources
   and integrating smart airport systems. The study proposes a
   comprehensive and adaptive ABIM management framework that depicts the
   alignment and connectivity of ABIM processes, resources and stakeholders
   with airport operational requirements by identifying gaps in the
   industry and literature, and developing a global understanding in ABIM
   visions. Research data are collected through literature and industry
   review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews with aviation
   professionals. Mixed methods including non-parametric statistical
   analysis and qualitative analysis are used to determine the elements of
   the framework. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) principles and
   language are used to generate the framework. For framework validation, a
   proof of concept (POC) is conducted by development and deployment of a
   web-based application. The developed ABIM framework is expected to guide
   major airport stakeholders in their BIM implementation processes to
   enhance airport operational efficiencies and in strategizing digital
   initiatives on a connected-BIM platform.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Selecting a suitable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
   system is critical, because it impacts a building's life cycle cost
   (LCC). Several factors affect the selection decision, such as quality,
   buildability, internal and external building appearance, HVAC size and
   weight, and LCC. These criteria are difficult to measure, as they are
   not based on agreed measurement units. Another challenging factor in the
   selection process is assessing the building's function/performance and
   determining its HVAC needs. Currently, the decision depends mostly on
   expert knowledge, and there is no agreed-upon systematic method to
   follow. This paper aims to develop a systematic model for selecting HVAC
   systems based on the value engineering (VE) concept. The model
   identified fourteen criteria based on an agreed standard test for
   objective criteria and a typical evaluation for subjective criteria.
   These HVAC criteria were assessed using a combination of the AHP,
   pairwise, function analysis system (FAST), and Monte Carlo techniques.
   As a result, a complete model was developed to enhance the selection
   process, programmed within the building information modeling (BIM)
   environment platform. Several HVAC experts were interviewed and more
   than twenty expert opinions were collected to validate the model. In
   addition, a case study building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was implemented
   using the programmed HVAC selection model for validation purposes. The
   programmed model can significantly facilitate the selection process for
   designers.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Data-driven green building design in BIM is challenged by the lack of a
   comprehensive data integration framework with the capabilities of
   building life-cycle performance data management and application. This
   paper proposes a performance integrated BIM (P-BIM) framework for
   building life cycle energy efficiency and environment optimization. A
   school building is presented as a case study to verify the P-BIM
   framework and the design optimization workflow established. The results
   show that the optimization can improve IEQ by 11.5\% and reduce LCC by
   36.8\%. The influences of different envelope constructions on indoor
   environment, energy consumptions, and costs are also studied. The P-BIM
   framework and the optimization methodology built on it demonstrate that
   the methodology developed can expand the application scope of BIM and
   contribute to datadriven green building design. More application
   scenarios focusing on the stage of facility management and different
   sustainability performance will be conducted in P-BIM framework in
   future works.},

Title = {Residential Real Estate Valuation Framework Based on Life Cycle Cost by
   Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Real estate markets are ideal investment options that lead to the
   construction industry's and the economy's growth. Therefore, having
   appropriate investment and valuation strategies is a critical success
   factor. Most established valuation methods emphasize market value and
   economic factors and are ignorant about buildings' technical and
   structural attributes. Therefore, due to the process ambiguity and lack
   of information access, the estimated price usually differs from the real
   property value. In this research, a revised valuation framework is
   proposed based on the life cycle cost (LCC) of residential properties,
   focusing on the operation phase. LCC consists of all costs related to an
   asset during different phases of its lifecycle, and it helps determine
   the net present value of the property. For systematically storing and
   analyzing technical and financial information, building information
   modeling (BIM) was proposed. Despite being widely used in the design and
   construction phases, its application and competitive advantage to real
   estate developers and managers during the operation phase are not
   transparent. This research benefitted from the 5D BIM model with a level
   of development (LOD) of 300 to increase the transparency and validity of
   valuation. An 18.25\% difference between the calculated price of two
   case studies in Tehran and their inflated market prices proved this

Abstract = {For next-generation buildings, continuous commissioning over the
   life-cycle is essential. In particular, Japanese buildings, which are
   exposed to recent extreme climate fluctuations and natural disasters,
   are required to ensure indoor thermal comfort, even under various
   situations. For this reason, recent HVAC\&R-systems are often
   complicated because they need to be flexibly changed according to
   various situations. Furthermore, demands for HVAC\&R-systems have been
   diversifying in response to advances in work styles and IT systems,
   improvements in building performance, and user demands. In order to
   optimally plan and operate such a complex HVAC\&R-system, it is
   important to perform commissioning in each life-cycle phase of design,
   construction, and operation. It is also important to make the operation
   method of the HVAC\&R-system easy to understand, to convey it to
   building users. In recent years, virtual visualization of building
   models has been rapidly developed by BIM, which can unify information
   from design to construction and operation. In Japan, it is used from
   design through construction, and it is currently being sought to use it
   as an operation tool, to communicate the design intent. In this paper, a
   case study of a tenant office building in Tokyo is described, where
   commissioning from the design stage to the operation stage was
   performed. This process made full use of BIM and simulation that can be
   used during the entire life-cycle of the building.},

Abstract = {A significant share of federal and regional infrastructure budgets is
   spent on constructing, maintaining, repairing, and replacing road
   infrastructure. Due to its magnitude, sustainable road construction
   practices can support national sustainable development goals (e.g. The
   Federal Sustainable Development Strategy of Canada). However, the quest
   for sustainable road construction practices has been hindered by the
   lack of expertise, information, and resources. The advent of building
   information modeling (BIM) provides more extensive access to functional
   and physical data of construction material. Published literature has
   overlooked BIM-based methods that facilitate the life cycle
   sustainability evaluation of road construction techniques. This paper
   presents a methodological framework for life cycle thinking-based road
   infrastructure evaluation. This framework compares the life cycle
   sustainability performance of alternative road pavement construction
   methods. A BIM-based visual program has been created to automate the
   proposed framework. The program was demonstrated by comparing three road
   construction methods for a collector road. Results indicated that
   geomembrane road is the best solution based on the triple bottom line of
   sustainability. The proposed Life cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA)
   framework, a BIM-based tool, and the implementation road map will assist
   infrastructure managers in selecting the most sustainable road
   construction method that will consequently support United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).},

Abstract = {Currently, the construction industry is turning towards sustainability.
   Nevertheless, in order to achieve a sustainable performance, a balance
   between environmental, social and economic criteria has to be created.
   There are already different tools available which have the potential to
   reach this goal. It is necessary to identify them as such and find out
   how they can be integrated to obtain synergies and contribute to
   sustainable construction. These tools have to be implemented in early
   design phases so as to add value to the project. In the present paper,
   two powerful methods, namely BIM and LCA, will be highlighted. Such
   methods can be of great assistance in the context of sustainability. On
   the one hand, BIM supports integrated design and improves information
   management and cooperation between the different stakeholders throughout
   the different project life-cycle phases. On the other hand, LCA is a
   suitable method for assessing environmental performance. Both LCA and
   BIM should be integrated in the decision-making process at an early
   stage with a view to achieving a holistic overview of the project,
   including environmental criteria, from the beginning. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {The management of the life cycle of large publicly owned social housing
   complexes requires a large amount of human and technological resources,
   the optimization of which is a desirable and shared objective. This
   article proposes a workflow for the enhancement of these management
   processes based on BIM (Building Information Modelling), a methodology
   capable of integrating architectural information into a
   three-dimensional graphic model. The proposed workflow defines the basic
   characteristics of the BIM model oriented toward sustainable building
   management and its relationship with the key moments of its life cycle.
   It also analyzes the architectural information associated with the
   models and determines which parameters are optimal for their completion
   from the BIM models in terms of reliability, auditability, and
   automation. For this purpose, a case study has been developed for a
   multifamily residential building in Malaga (Spain), owned by the
   Andalusian Housing and Rehabilitation Agency AVRA, a public agency that
   manages a housing stock of more than 70,000 dwellings.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the long-term use of buildings, renovations are sometimes required as
   usage behaviors have changed and residents' demands for space are
   adjusted. However, the public in general are deficient in renovation
   knowledge and information regarding building use and its maintenance
   phases; thus, the initial stage of planning and design often lacks
   flexibility, leading to waste materials in the subsequent renovation
   project. Theoretically, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be used
   as a building unit resume and renovation benefit prediction tool;
   moreover, it plays an important role in the usage and maintenance
   phases. This study develops three design proposals that target different
   service lives (30 years, 50 years, 100 years), as based on the
   building's expected life, and uses BIM technology to simulate the life
   cycle cost and design performance, as based on the renovation scenario
   analysis of the building's life cycle. The findings show that under the
   service condition target of 100 years, when the open flexible technique
   is used for the design, space utilization flexibility is enhanced,
   pipeline maintenance is convenient, waste is reduced, and performance in
   life cycle cost is better. BIM can predict performance simply and
   rapidly according to future usage demand adjustments after the initial
   design.},

Title = {Value Management Integration for Whole Life Cycle: Post COVID-19
   Strategy for the UK Construction Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Value management (VM) and its integration in the whole life cycle (WLC)
   have become huge concepts for construction projects to provide
   additional value of an asset for the end user or client. However, the
   role of VM and its integration as part of the WLC in a construction
   project remain reactive, and highly impacted by nature of the project,
   and this has become more challenging with the epidemic impact of
   COVID-19. This research aims to investigate the mechanisms that delivers
   value management as part of the ``re-invent{''} strategy proposed by the
   Construction Leadership Council in the UK government to improve WLC for
   buildings. In addition to existing secondary data from the literature,
   primary data were attained using a focus group with six quantity
   surveyors from different cost consultancies in the UK to gather
   qualitative evidence using their experiences, perceptions, and key
   challenges they face when integrating VM. Findings revealed that value
   management is primarily being used as a cost-cutting tool, the majority
   of quantity surveyors lack knowledge of what it encompasses, hence the
   industry needs a more proactive strategy towards it. Analysis revealed
   that value management is primarily implemented as a cost-cutting
   solution, key stakeholders (e.g., facility managers) need to be
   integrated, and there is no standardised process to incorporate value
   management in projects. The study proposes a four-dimensional
   (governance and policies, sustainability, industry's best practice, and
   innovation and technology) strategy to facilitate more holistic
   considerations of value management post COVID-19. Future work looks into
   evaluating the strategy proposed while acknowledging different
   procurement routes.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has become more interested in moving towards
   implementing an innovative method to reduce wastes and Environmental
   Impacts (EIs) during the construction stage. Tools and methods
   represented in different frameworks to estimate construction wastes are
   limited to the end of life stage of building projects. A common method
   employed for this quantification is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which
   is globally recognized as one of the most complete methods for the
   environmental impact assessment of buildings. Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) would be an ideal platform to integrate LCA to assist in
   this process. However, BIM and LCA tools are currently not fully
   interoperable. This research aims to represent a methodology to quantify
   total waste produced in the building's lifecycle. The main reasons for
   producing waste are examined profoundly and some solutions leading to
   waste reduction are proposed. Additionally, the environmental impact of
   the materials converted to waste is evaluated in an integrated
   environment by developing an add-in inside BIM tool, which calculates
   waste produced in each step of buildings' lifespan to be used by LCA
   tool. An application of an actual building project will be presented in
   order to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed
   approaches.},

Abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) and the digital exchange of
   information in the construction industry is growing rapidly. Objects and
   their information are being exchanged throughout the supply chain and
   throughout the lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur.
   Information is defined and interpreted differently by the different
   parties. Automated exchange of information in the industry is therefore
   not possible. The Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide
   national cooperation between partners in the total building sector, took
   the initiative to develop a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL)(1): ``one
   language for the building sector{''}. Based on the concept of
   ``distributed libraries{''}, the library is mapped to other
   international and national libraries and classification systems. The
   CB-NL is an open standard, beneficial for all partners: More efficient
   exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire
   supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer's
   design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures
   arising from misinterpretation. Many national and international
   standards are mapped to the CB-NL by now. This paper describes the CB-NL
   and covers some practical experiences.},

Abstract = {A surge in energy demand driven by the growing number of buildings and
   insufficient attention to sustainable and optimised energy-saving
   procedures are likely to threaten the economy and the environment. The
   building envelope is a significant component that influences energy
   requirements, directly affecting the operations costs. Thus, the current
   study considers the envelope to optimise the building's Life Cycle
   Costing (LCC) and enhance energy efficiency. Therefore, to achieve the
   aim of the study, Building Information Modelling (BIM) with the
   integration of Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is adopted to assess the
   building envelope and optimise energy use and relevant costs. Three
   alternatives of wall system: brick wall with rockwool insulation, brick
   wall with polystyrene insulation and curtain walls system, are
   considered for the building envelope to enhance energy-saving potential
   by analysing and comparing the energy demand. To determine LCCA, the Net
   Present Value (NPV) approach was adopted for the initial expenditure and
   the associated future costs. It was found that utilising insulation
   material with low thermal conductivity reduces heating and cooling
   energy resulting optimised LCC. Compared to curtain walls, the results
   show that the rockwool insulated wall reduces 17\% of energy demand
   while the polystyrene wall reduces 12.7\% of the energy. Similarly,
   rockwool insulated walls save 5\% energy relative to the wall system
   with polystyrene insulation. Thus, integrating LCCA with the BIM
   approach at the conceptual design stages promotes energy and LCC
   optimisation.},

   therefore the cornerstone of the world economy. However, compared with
   other industries, almost all of them are investing more into
   digitization than the construction sector. Fewer investments in
   digitization are just in the agriculture and hunting sectors. The author

Abstract = {Architecture is one of the important factors that cause environmental
   pollution. This study aims to strengthen the application of green design
   concept in architecture, promote the sustainable development of
   architecture, and realize the rational utilization of public resources.
   First, according to the life cycle and sustainable development theories,
   building sustainability is divided into three levels: economy,
   environment, and society. Second, based on the building information
   modeling (BIM) technology, the economic evaluation model, environmental
   evaluation model, and social evaluation model of sustainable building
   life cycle are established. Moreover, the life cycle cost, environmental
   impact evaluation, and social impact evaluation of buildings at
   different stages are analyzed to realize the comprehensive evaluation of
   building sustainability and promote the green development of
   architectural design. The results denote that the pre-project cost
   accounts for the lowest proportion in the sustainable life cycle of
   buildings without discount. The operation and maintenance cost is the
   highest, accounting for 65.4\%. Regarding net present value, the project
   cost is mainly installation, outdoor, etc., with 61.5\%, while the
   proportion of operation and maintenance expenses and demolition expenses
   decreases. According to the social assessment of the sustainable
   building life cycle, workers' welfare greatly impacts society, among
   which fair salary, health, and social welfare have an impact degree of
   0.15, 0.175, and 1.714, respectively. Economically, after considering
   the discount rate, operation and maintenance can save costs more
   effectively. At the environmental level, there are differences in the
   evaluation of environmental impact at different stages of the building
   life cycle. The social welfare at the worker level has the most
   significant impact on society, which extends to all stages of the
   building life cycle, and the impact at the worker level is higher than
   the social value level, which is consistent with the actual situation,
   and verifies the quantifiable ability of the model to the social
   sustainability of buildings. In this study, life cycle cost analysis and
   BIM technology are integrated to realize the evaluation of building
   sustainability in economic, environmental, and social aspects, thus
   enhancing the development of sustainability in the field of architecture
   and making some contributions to promoting the rational utilization of
   public resources.},

Abstract = {BIM-LCA integration facilitates sustainability indicators in
   infrastructure projects; however, BIM-LCA integration poses
   interoperability and information exchange issues. This study develops a
   parametric-life-cycle-carbonassessment (PLCCA) model for automating
   data-integration, dynamic-computations, and online-visualization of
   carbon emissions. Emission factors (EFs) are systematically integrated
   as additional design parameters in the BIM-model. Carbon emissions are
   dynamically calculated using parameterized inputs. Rhino-Grasshopper
   plugins generate real-time bar charts and color codes inside
   BIM-environments. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) incorporates carbon
   emissions, materials, energy, and cost to optimize design parameters and
   facilitate early decisions. The performance and applicability of PLCCA
   are evaluated using a tunnel in Yunnan, China. Production and
   operational stages account for 30\% and 65\% of carbon emissions. Tunnel
   is then remodeled with optimized parameters; carbon emissions are
   recalculated to reduce environmental effects. Carbon emissions in the
   production and operational phases are reduced by 32.94\% and 28.40\%.
   This research educates project stakeholders on low-carbon techniques to
   attain carbon neutrality.},

Title = {Barriers to BIM-Based Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment for
   Buildings: An Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as central to
   construction design, planning, execution and maintenance, integration
   into the entire infrastructure sustainability process is imperative for
   achieving sustainable development. Despite its immense benefit of aiding
   compliance to sustainable construction, potential barriers continue to
   widen the gap in implementation. Therefore, this study adopts the
   ``interpretive structural modelling approach{''} to advance a ranked
   structure of the interrelatedness of the barriers to integrating BIM in
   buildings sustainability assessment. The ``Matrice d'Impacts
   croises-multipication applique a classement analysis (MICMAC){''} was
   utilised to categorise the identified adoption barriers in the model.
   The identified barriers and relationship with themselves are valuable in
   discussing the challenges to BIM-based LCA and developing policies and
   design decisions to drive the process further. Further, it adds to the
   emerging discussion of BIM from the life cycle sustainability assessment
   perspective for infrastructure. The findings are critical for policy,
   stakeholders and extending the body of knowledge.},

Abstract = {Recent studies in construction waste and management (CWM) have mainly
   investigated the waste management chain from a static perspective and
   failed to take into account the dynamic nature of parameters and their
   correlation. In addition, the current studies of building information
   modeling (BIM)-based CWM failed to analyze the cost-benefits due to the
   lack of numerical economic benchmarks. To address the gap, this study
   developed a system dynamic (SD) model to analyze the economic aspects of
   construction and demolition (C\&D) waste from using BIM. Causal loop and
   stock-flow diagrams are modeled based on the determined variables and
   their interrelationships. Standard sensitivity tests were then performed
   to establish the validity of the model under real system conditions.
   Different scenarios were applied to simulate and compare the model
   results in response to various policies. A case study was conducted to
   quantify the costs and the profits. Based on the comparison with the
   conventional approach and BIM-based method, BIM can reduce CWM cost by
   up to 57\%. The findings also indicated that higher landfill charges
   will not be able to motivate managers to use sustainable CWM;
   conversely, increasing the modularity of design and earlier realization
   of net benefits will incentivize project managers to employ BIM-based
   CWM.},

Title = {Parametric BIM-based life cycle assessment framework for optimal
   sustainable design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The construction sector is liable for a sizable amount of CO2 emissions
   and waste. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered one of the crucial
   tools that aids in evaluating the impacts of construction emissions.
   This research aims to quantify the life cycle impacts of the initial and
   recurrent embodied emissions, operating and reuse/disposal emissions,
   and utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) for a more holistic
   life cycle approach. The research proposes a parametric BIM-based LCA
   framework for quantifying the environmental impacts and evaluating the
   effects of material selection for both embodied and operating emissions.
   In addition, it considers the different reuse scenarios and percentages
   and their effect on both the embodied and operating impacts. The
   proposed framework consists of five main modules: data acquisition
   module, operating and embodied emissions module, life cycle assessment
   module, optimization module, and decision-making module. This parametric
   assessment can be applied for both the conventional and circular
   approach impacts. For the decision-making process, the resulting
   emissions are optimized utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and evaluated through an LCA and Data Envelopment
   Analysis (DEA) methodology for the material selection. A case study of a
   residential villa in Cairo is worked out to illustrate the key features
   of the proposed framework. This assessment analyzes the building
   materials' characteristics and efficiency investigating the external
   walls, internal walls, floors, roofs, and windows design possibilities,
   and uses visual programming to control the resulting emissions for a
   more flexible approach. By comparing the integrated LCA and DEA models
   three optimum design solutions, the conventional approach develops
   design solutions of higher embodied Global Warming Potential (GWP) than
   the circular approach. However, it develops lower operating GWP with
   better applied U-values. The circularity approach employment has reduced
   the efficiency of the operating GWP due to utilizing materials with high
   heat transmittance ability.},

Abstract = {In the context of the general trend to accelerate change, the life cycle
   of a construction object, analysis and design of its stages becomes an
   actual object of scientific research in the field of construction. The
   subject of the study becomes the information model of the life cycle of
   the building. It is studied and modeled on the basis of the concept of
   real estate development and using the methods of project analysis of the
   construction project. With the help of BIM-modeling tools, mandatory
   stages and possible phases of the life cycle of a building object can be
   represented as hierarchically and sequentially related information
   flows, in which the attributes of each stage of the life cycle are
   formed under the influence of the preceding stages and of special
   factors for the considered stage. On this basis, an analysis of the
   characteristics was carried out, and the structure of simple and complex
   construction works was developed, which allows determining for each
   stage of the life cycle of a construction object: interconnection of
   information flows, composition and content of the information model of
   the building required for the work of specialists.},

Abstract = {The physical adaptability of buildings is very important in today's
   fast-changing business environment. The actors who invest in long-term
   adaptability are positioned better to the changes during the life cycle
   of a building. This conceptual paper argues that the current dominating
   real estate (property) investment analysis theories do not accommodate
   enough building design-related information (i.e. physical asset
   characteristics), which results in long-term loss of competitiveness and
   unsustainable use of built environment resources. It is demonstrated
   that physical asset characteristics can create valuable real options
   that should be acknowledged in real estate investment analysis and
   management. The real estate investment literature has not so far been
   able to produce a widely accepted financial model for justifying
   life-cycle investments. A theory is proposed here that can be used to
   value life-cycle investments in buildings. This new theory combines of
   real options valuation, investment analysis and building component
   life-cycle design. These themes are used to formulate a conceptual
   framework for valuing life-cycle investments. The framework is intuitive
   and transparent, and it can be easily added to current spreadsheet
   investment analysis tools.},

   infrastructures and uses of BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the conditions of the
   building information modelling (BIM) implementation in facility
   management (FM) specifically from the point of view of different groups
   of FM practitioners, and the FM infrastructures already in use.
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review on the gap between the
   uses of BIM in design and FM has been done. The key professional groups
   of FM in the Premises Centre of the City of Helsinki were interviewed on
   the information tools they use, and the needs and impediments of the BIM
   implementation in the FM. Cultural-historical activity theory is used as
   a theoretical framework.
   Findings - The literature discussing the BIM implementation tends to
   omit the analysis of the existing FM information systems and software
   tools in use. The challenge in the BIM implementation is in which ways
   the relevant information included in the BIM models could be integrated
   with these systems. No well-articulated problems or developmental
   contradictions came up that would demand the investment in the BIM
   implementation.
   Practical implications - The results call for experimenting with
   incremental implementation of BIM in different FM activities and in the
   FM information infrastructures in use.
   Originality/value - This paper studies empirically different FM
   activities and information systems used by the professional groups. Such
   studies are needed for a realistic view of the potential integration of
   the BIM information to the FM information systems.},

Abstract = {Buildings play a major role in increasing energy consumption and bulk
   atmospheric emissions. Energy analysis must be taken into consideration
   because of increased global warming. In the present scenario, Glazed
   walls with gas infills are preferred for their aesthetic appearance by
   AEC designers (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) in commercial
   buildings. The environmental impact must be considered in the selection
   of glazing panels and framing materials of a building. In this work, a
   fully glazed commercial building (FGCB) is chosen and modelled using
   Autodesk-Revit (BIM software) and then simulated using Green Building
   Studio Software. The life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) and life cycle
   cost analysis (LCCA) results are compared to come out with
   energy-efficient and cost-effective material. The optimized energy usage
   of Double low-E glazing and Double reverse glazing with glass infill
   were compared with the existing single clear glass for their performance
   over its entire life cycle based on both energy usage, cost, and
   greenhouse gas emission by analysing its embodied and operating energy.

Title = {Green Template for Life Cycle Assessment of Buildings Based on Building
   Information Modeling: Focus on Embodied Environmental Impact},

Abstract = {The increased popularity of building information modeling (BIM) for
   application in the construction of eco-friendly green buildings has
   given rise to techniques for evaluating green buildings constructed
   using BIM features. Existing BIM-based green building evaluation
   techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which
   pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data
   compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To
   overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the
   green template) for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of
   using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle
   assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of
   detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental
   impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied
   environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting
   an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were
   developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation
   table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials.
   Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental
   impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its
   applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied
   environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated
   against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2D takeoff), and its
   reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of 5\%. This study
   aims to develop a system for assessing the impact of the substances
   discharged from concrete production process on six environmental impact
   categories, i.e., global warming (GWP), acidification (AP),
   eutrophication (EP), abiotic depletion (ADP), ozone depletion (ODP), and
   photochemical oxidant creation (POCP), using the life a cycle assessment
   (LCA) method. To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically
   applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by
   adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations.},

Abstract = {With the development of economy and the improvement of living standards,
   people pay much attention to quality of dwellings rather than quantity.
   What is more, the traditional house building method is inefficient and
   the poor quality cannot meet the demand of the market. Therefore, a new
   architecture building method, prefabricated housing appears and the
   management method also needs to be changed. This article analyses the
   features of prefabricated housing in order to build a new management
   model for Chinese prefabricated housing. The theory of life cycle
   management is chosen to manage this new building mode. The technology of
   BIM and mass customization strategy are treated as basic theories to
   support this essay. Det Ljuva Livet is used as an example to prove that
   the life cycle management of prefabricated housing is reasonable and
   feasible.},

Title = {Uncertainty Analysis of Life Cycle Energy Assessment in Early Stages of
   Design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {208},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {During building design and especially in early stages, important
   decisions influencing the lifecycle-based energy demand of buildings are
   made. Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) is used to evaluate this
   energy demand already in early stages of design. However, at that point,
   the building design and the related information can quickly change and
   are subject to potentially large uncertainty. This uncertainty in
   building information influences the LCEA and therefore decisions taken
   by the designer. Due to the uncertainty, it is difficult to distinguish
   between the performance of different design variants to decide for the
   best option. This study presents a method to perform LCEA and to assess
   and consequently strategically reduce the influence of uncertainties in
   buildings' information on the LCEA in early design stages. Uncertainty
   analysis is used to assess the influence of uncertainty on LCEA and to
   prioritize decisions to reduce uncertainty. The method is embedded in a
   multi-Level of Development (LOD) modelling approach covering the
   development of the building during the early stages of design. The
   method is applied to seven different building shapes as a proof of
   concept. It is concluded that the method renders valid results to assess
   the project-specific uncertainty in LCEA results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Numerous costs are associated with the design, construction,
   installation, operation, maintenance, and deconstruction of a building
   or building system. One of the challenges usually faced by an
   organization's capital planning department and/or facility management
   department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly
   estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the
   programming phase when no building design is available. To provide
   facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to
   assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are
   developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple
   building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to
   predict facilities' LCC-initial design and construction cost, utility
   cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors
   propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using
   data provided by building systems. The corresponding domain
   ontology-LCCA-Onto-is also presented. The proposed approach provides
   organizations who own multiple facilities with an innovative solution to
   the LCC prediction issue.},

Abstract = {Calculating emissions and related environmental impacts for buildings is
   typically a data-heavy and labour-intensive task. Widely used life cycle
   assessment (LCA) standards require meticulous modelling of multiple
   processes for each part within a product or a subassembly. This level of
   detailing demands time-consuming manual modelling and essentially
   renders full LCA of entire city blocks unrealistic. Within this context,
   this paper investigates how LCA results of modelling processes which
   involve a range of automated input data sources compare to those
   resulting from a highly detailed base case model. Findings show that
   models generated from data gathered from Google Street View and the U.S.
   Census produce the closest results to the base case model, with the
   lowest deviations occurring in embodied energy (0.06-6.0\%) and global
   warming potential (0.7-4.8\%) results. These findings imply that data
   with lower granularity can lead to precise LCA results, depending on the
   inventory and impact categories considered.},

   overruns during construction. Critical to the successful delivery of PPP
   projects is effective performance measurement/evaluation. Yet,
   conventional ex-post evaluation that solely focuses on meeting budget
   and a predetermined schedule are invariably applied to measure PPPs in
   practice. This paper reviews the performance measurement literature used
   to evaluate PPP projects and proposes that a life-cycle approach to
   their evaluation is needed to `future proof' their performance and
   ensure value for money that is delivered to the public sector. As the
   primary focus of PPPs is to maximise profitability, there is a need to
   ameliorate the coordination and integration between the Special Purpose
   Vehicle, end-users and the public sector. This can be enabled through
   the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as it not only
   provides digital representation of the physical and functional
   characteristics of an asset, but also provides key decision makers with
   the ability to make informed decisions across a project's life-cycle.
   When aligned with a series of core indicators that are used for
   performance measurement, it is suggested that BIM can act as a catalyst
   for `future proofing' PPPs and enable the successful management of an
   asset throughout its life-cycle. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {The construction industry is well known for generating a large amount of
   carbon emissions and this, together with huge costs of buildings during
   their life cycle, seriously affects its environmental and economic
   sustain -ability. That reducing the former tends to increase the latter
   is a highly significant problem exacerbating the situation. Finding a
   solution with the lowest carbon emission at a certain cost is an urgent
   problem to be solved. Research to date aimed at remedying the situation,
   however, has been largely focused on either treating the two issues
   independently or partially conjoined, with little progress in their
   integrated assessment. In response, this study presents a method for
   integrating the life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) and life cycle costs
   (LCC) of buildings to assess their life cycle carbon emission intensity
   (CEI) based on BIM technology. Through a public building in China as a
   case study, the feasibility of the method is verified, the key stages of
   building carbon emissions are analyzed using CEI, and the conversion of
   high carbon emission materials to low carbon emission materials is
   explored. The proposed methodology and framework provide solutions and
   ideas for achieving optimal costs commensurate with low carbon emissions
   throughout the building life cycle, facilitating the assessment of
   carbon emissions at the decision-making and design stages, achieving the
   optimization of building carbon emissions and costs, and enhancing
   building life cycle sustainability.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment Framework for Embodied Environmental Impacts of
   Building Construction Systems},

Abstract = {This paper develops a life cycle assessment framework for embodied
   environmental impacts of building construction systems. The framework is
   intended to be used early in the design stage to assist decision making
   in identifying sources of higher embodied impacts and in selecting
   sustainable design alternatives. The framework covers commonly used
   building construction systems such as reinforced concrete construction
   (RCC), hot-rolled steel construction (HRS), and light steel construction
   (LSC). The system boundary is defined for the framework from
   cradle-to-grave plus recycling and reuse possibilities. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment are integrated in
   the developed framework to evaluate life cycle embodied energy and
   embodied greenhouse emissions of design options. The life cycle
   inventory data used to develop the framework were extracted from BIM
   models for the building material quantities, verified Environmental
   Product Declarations (EPD) for the material production stage, and the
   design of construction operations for the construction and end-of-life
   stages. Application of the developed framework to a case study of a
   university building revealed the following results. The material
   production stage had the highest contribution to embodied impacts,
   reaching about 90\%. Compared with the conventional RCC construction
   system, the HRS construction system had 41\% more life cycle embodied
   energy, while the LSC construction system had 34\% less life cycle
   embodied energy. When each system was credited with the net benefits
   resulting from possible recycling/reuse beyond building life, the HRS
   construction system had 10\% less life cycle embodied energy, while the
   LSC construction system had 68\% less life cycle embodied energy.
   Similarly, the HRS construction system had 29\% less life cycle
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the LSC construction system had
   62\% less life cycle GHG emissions. Sustainability assessment results
   showed that the RCC construction system received zero Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credit points, the HRS
   construction system received three LEED credit points, while the LSC
   construction system received five LEED credit points.},

Title = {Mind the gap: Facilitating early design stage building life cycle
   assessment through a co-production approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {464},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Despite the transition towards a circular economy (CE) being a
   significant element in achieving the decarbonisation of the built
   environment, a clear and common pathway to applying CE principles to
   building design is still lacking in both industry practice and academia.
   The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) has the potential to enable the identification of
   feasible pathways to increase circularity. This study aims to
   investigate its practical use to facilitate the application of circular
   economy principles at the early stage of building design via using
   LCA-based BIM plugins. Within this aim, the paper centres on a co
   -production approach and presents a gap analysis by identifying gaps in
   knowledge and implementation as well as addressing the pressing needs of
   the current practice in the UK. A series of semi -structured interviews
   with expert practitioners in the field were conducted for data
   collection, contributing to the following phases of the co -production
   by allowing for an in-depth investigation and reflection of the
   practice. The findings have revealed that: (a) there is still an
   insufficient level of contextual awareness and readiness in the
   implementation of CE principles in the built environment and LCA
   understanding and (b) the adoption of BIM at the early stages of
   building design is still limited in the current practice; BIM models
   with sufficient level of data details and quality to enable circularity
   assessment are rarely produced. Thus, the paper highlights the need for
   enabling mechanisms, including the introduction of legislative
   instruments, the involvement and commitment of the industry and key
   stakeholders, the support for training and skills improvement, and the
   establishment of effective communication and implementation process
   management frameworks. Future research agenda points to the need of
   formulation of a BIM protocol to enable integration of BIM and LCA to
   promote CE principles in the building design process.},

Abstract = {The rapid and continuous rise in the energy costs dictates significant
   cost control efforts during buildings' operation phase, despite the fact
   that achieving remarkable energy cost reductions are highly governed by
   the decisions taken during earlier phases of the construction project.
   As a solution, researches attempt to present workflows that include Life
   Cycle Costs (LCC) techniques in the evaluation of building assemblies.
   Some managed to integrate it with Building Information Modelling (BIM),
   while others focused on including the operating energy costs in the
   evaluation without the BIM integration. This paper aims to propose a
   more structured method that both combines the capabilities of BIM and
   energy simulations with the LCC can be developed employing the available
   efforts made. A case study is used to apply the proposed method, and the
   results show that around 17\% LCC savings can be achieved when including
   the energy costs in roof assemblies. The proposed method can be used by
   facility managers or building design team to select the most
   cost-effective building envelope assembly.},

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for Estimating Building Embodied Carbon Based on
   Digital Twin Technology and Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Low-carbon building design requests an estimation of total embodied
   carbon as the environmental performance metric for comparison of
   different design options in early design stages. Due to a lack of
   consensus on the system boundaries in building life cycle assessment
   (LCA), the carbon estimation results obtained by the current methods are
   often disputable. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for
   estimating building embodied carbon based on digital twin technology and
   LCA. The proposed method is advantageous over others by providing (1) a
   cradle-to-cradle LCA and (2) an automated data communication between LCA
   and building information modelling (BIM) databases. Because data for the
   processes in the life cycle are collected via digital twin technology in
   a standard and consistent way, the obtained results will be considered
   credible. So far, a conceptual framework is developed based on a
   comprehensive literature review, which consists of three parts. In the
   first part, formulas for LCA are given. In the second part, a hybrid
   approach combining semantic web with a relational database for BIM and
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) integration is described. In the
   third part, how to design the LCA database and how to link LCA with BIM
   are described. The conceptual framework proposed is tested for its
   reasonableness by a small hypothetical case study.},

Abstract = {The energy consumption and pollutant emission of construction
   engineering bring great impact on environment, so we propose a scheme
   based on the full life cycle in this article. It adopts BIM technology
   and relative tools to establish multi-dimensional information mode of
   construction projects and further define the relation between BIM mode
   elements and building materials, by quantifying the environmental effect
   of building material and establishing assessment index library of
   project environmental impact. Then the environmental decision method in
   BIM-LCA, AHP is introduced by detailed procedures and decision
   conclusions, and specific cases are also provided. The study results
   show that in the assessment of full life cycle, BIM model can provide
   most data needed for LCA. Corresponding measures can be taken according
   to the environmental impact assessment results produced by different
   phrases, which shows active roles for the decision assessment of
   construction project and provides valuable decision making for
   high-performance architectural design.},

   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the
   digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building
   information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall
   life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration
   with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical
   analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share
   several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to
   address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management,
   where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a
   systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to
   retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results
   found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and
   suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and
   practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address
   ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the
   BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA
   approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration
   topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for
   BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is
   the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to
   perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems
   for asset management.},

Abstract = {The Building Information Modeling (BIM) creates new opportunities for
   advanced collaboration and project coordination to develop building
   design solutions-documentation and construction processes. By comparing
   global BIM development with local context, this paper outlines the
   benefits, enablers and barriers associated with its role in Kosovo, to
   makes suggestions about how BIM issues may be addressed towards
   sustainable development and better asset performance over the
   life-cycle. As a result, adaption of BIM creates a rapid clip in both
   regional and local context, becoming a well-known established tool into
   the process bidding, pre-construction, construction and post
   construction phases for Architectural, Engineering and Construction
   (AEC) industry. BIM as a minimum tool in near future, starting from
   institutions, owners and/ or end users, shall be introduced and required

Title = {Leveraging Infrastructure BIM for Life-Cycle-Based Sustainable Road
   Pavement Management},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},

Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The latest developments in the field of road asphalt materials and
   pavement construction/maintenance technologies, as well as the spread of
   life-cycle-based sustainability assessment techniques, have posed issues
   in the continuous and efficient management of data and relative
   decision-making process for the selection of appropriate road pavement
   design and maintenance solutions; Infrastructure Building Information
   Modeling (IBIM) tools may help in facing such challenges due to their
   data management and analysis capabilities. The present work aims to
   develop a road pavement life cycle sustainability assessment framework
   and integrate such a framework into the IBIM of a road pavement project
   through visual scripting to automatically provide the informatization of
   an appropriate pavement information model and evaluate sustainability
   criteria already in the design stage through life cycle assessment and
   life cycle cost analysis methods. The application of the proposed
   BIM-based tool to a real case study allowed us (a) to draw
   considerations about the long-term environmental and economic
   sustainability of alternative road construction materials and (b) to
   draft a maintenance plan for a specific road section that represents the
   best compromise solution among the analyzed ones. The IBIM tool
   represents a practical and dynamic way to integrate environmental
   considerations into road pavement design, encouraging the use of digital
   tools in the road industry and ultimately supporting a pavement
   maintenance decision-making process oriented toward a circular economy.},

Abstract = {The IEA EBCAnnex 72 focuses on the assessment of the primary energy
   demand, greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of buildings
   during production, construction, use and end of life (dismantling), i.e.
   during the entire life cycle of buildings. The purpose of the IEA EBC
   Annex 72 is to reach consensus on the assessment methodology, which yet
   allows to respecting national or regional traditions regarding data and
   modelling; to better link methods for the environmental assessment with
   methods and tools used during the design and planning process(i.e.
   building information modelling, BIM); to work towards the definition of
   national and regional benchmarks regarding primary energy demand,
   greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of buildings during
   their full life cycle; to support participating member countries in need
   in the task of developing national or regional life cycle assessment
   databases tailored to the building sector; and to agree on
   recommendations for national and international standardisation work
   related to life cycle thinking applied on buildings (e.g. energy
   performance of buildings directive (European Commission 2010).},

Title = {OpenBIM-based assessment for social cost of carbon through building life
   cycle},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Buildings produce many carbon emissions in their life cycle, which leads
   to global warming, human disease, ecosystem destruction, and food
   shortages. These harms are translated and revealed into the social cost
   of carbon (SCC), but assessing the building SCC considering protection
   objects is still difficult due to the lack of adequate and rapid tools.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on OpenBIM to calculate
   the SCC through the building life cycle. This method reflects the
   cause-effect chains of carbon emissions on human health, ecosystem
   quality, and social assets under LIME, EPS, and ReCiPe approaches. An
   original tool, NMBIM, is developed based on this proposed method, which
   calculates the SCC of a case building by directly importing industry
   foundation classes (IFC) files. The case results show that the maximum
   life cycle SCC reaches 5872.4 RMB/m2, which exceeds the construction
   cost. Although SCC results obtained by different LCIA models vary
   widely, the ones of human health are the most concerned protection
   objects. This paper provides an effective method for standardly storing
   and optimizing SCC at the project design stage, which contributes to
   construction industry planning, construction company decision-making,
   and public regulation.},

Abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings is a very important issue, where the
   operational demand is considered to be one of the highest amongst all
   other sectors of an economy. Moving towards energy efficient buildings
   is a key factor to achieve sustainability. A novel framework for
   integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modeling,
   and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency of
   the resulting building designs adopted, along with reducing the
   difficulties associated with the construction of the building, in terms
   of cost of construction, is developed. The framework accommodates
   various parameters, via integrating mathematical optimization
   programming, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to
   improve the building performance, identify alternative sustainable
   designs, and empower the decision-making process and sustainability in
   the construction sector. Through the developed optimization model, the
   examination of various alternatives for building components that make up
   the envelope of a residential building is undertaken. Insights gained
   from the results show that all components of building envelopes
   influence the energy consumption in buildings, particularly, exterior
   walls and windows. Impacts in terms of annual energy use intensity can
   be reduced by about 45\%, life cycle energy use and cost can be enhanced
   by more than 50\%, and environmental impacts such as acidification and
   global warming potential can be reduced by more than 30\%, due to use of
   the proposed framework. This work indicates that sustainable building
   decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and
   assessment of environmental impact via Building Information Modeling and
   life cycle assessment.},

Title = {Exploring the effects that a non-stationary climate and dynamic

   multi-city comparison},

Abstract = {There is a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   attributed to the built environment, either for production or the
   operation of buildings. Various initiatives are being implemented to
   reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the
   evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and
   removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings
   should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are
   effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades
   and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change
   significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the
   design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound
   life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage.
   A straightforward method that can be applied for a detailed
   understanding of the effects of climate change and prospective
   electricity grid mix on building energy use is presented. The novelty of
   this study was to integrate long-term energy projections in a high
   temporal resolution LCA for buildings and taking into account different
   future climates and prospective electricity mixes across Canada. The
   research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a
   Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate
   and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific
   robustness of LCA metrics. The proposed methodology will assist users to
   apply a clear framework that helps to define an optimized design
   alternative through a dynamic energy analysis and future weather
   forecasting simulation. An example of an actual office building is
   provided to demonstrate the capabilities and usefulness of the developed
   integrated framework.},

Title = {BIM-based approach to conduct Life Cycle Cost Analysis of resilient
   buildings at the conceptual stage},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {All costs within the life cycle of a building are known as its life
   cycle cost (LCC). In the design process of a building, the use of a
   lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar
   performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during
   the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a
   tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to
   select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally
   lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry
   additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to
   support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology
   in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC
   capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and
   increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC
   indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is
   developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency
   factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist
   designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The
   LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance
   cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's
   useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The
   earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to
   consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the
   proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and
   validated on two design options. The application of the actual building
   project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second
   alternative by 4.6\%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by
   35.4\%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4\% within
   the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the
   building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means
   the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin,
   designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages
   and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in
   its life cycle according to the proposed indices.},

Title = {Holistic life-cycle accounting of carbon emissions of prefabricated
   buildings using LCA and BIM},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated concrete building (PCB) can save resources, reduce
   construction, improve quality, and reduce pollution. Understanding PCB
   environmental benefits versus traditional buildings could reinforce
   relevant policies and adoption. This study aimed to develop a holistic
   life-cycle accounting system based on BIM technology to calculate carbon
   emissions of PCB accurately and efficiently, and verify the effects of
   energy saving and emission reduction. Existing international and
   national databanks allowed the compilation of carbon emission factors.
   Five representative residential PCB projects were enlisted to calculate
   carbon footprints in six individual life-cycle construction stages. In
   most stages, carbon emissions were reduced with an increasing
   prefabrication rate. In the operation and maintenance stage, carbon
   emissions accounted for approximately 91\% of the total, and the
   building materials production stage accounted for about 11\%. The
   ``negative carbon emission `` in the demolition and recycling stage was
   about-4\%. Carbon emissions of the remaining three stages were minimal
   at about < 2\%. This study established the whole life-cycle
   carbon-emission indices of residential prefabricated buildings, with
   average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 105.88
   kgCO(2)/(m(2).a), and computed values for individual building stages.
   For comparison, a completely cast-in-place building was studied, with
   average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 130.79
   kgCO(2)/(m(2).a), significantly higher than the PCB. The study
   contributed to knowledge by furnishing the holistic carbon footprint
   calculation method and establishing the empirical patterns and trends of
   carbon emissions of PCB. The findings could inform construction
   projects' carbon-emission control and achieve the construction
   industry's green and low-carbon goals. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Sensitivity analysis of design variables in life-cycle environmental
   impacts of buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large portion of global energy
   consumption and carbon emissions. Improvements in building design
   contribute to reducing environmental impacts of buildings. In this
   context, a crucial issue is to understand which design variables should
   be considered while which variables could be negligible. The objective
   of this study is to develop a framework for as-sessing the influence of
   various design variables throughout the design process in the
   environ-mental impacts of a building over its life cycle. This
   methodological framework combined build-ing information modelling and
   life cycle assessment tools and a global sensitivity analysis using the
   Morris elementary effects method. A residential building was applied to
   demonstrate the de-veloped framework. The influence of six design
   variables in early design stages (including, floor area, aspect ratio,
   floor height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio and number of floors),
   nine variables in detailed design stages (including, structure type of
   external and internal walls, type of insulation material for external
   and internal walls, insulation material for floors, waterproof-ing and
   insulation material for roof, type of window frame, and glazing type),
   and four variables in construction design stages (including, type of
   finishing for external walls, internal walls and floors, and roof tiles)
   are examined. Three environmental impact criteria (including, embodied,
   operational, and life-cycle environmental impacts) of a building are
   considered. The results iden-tified the most influential variables
   throughout the design process, highlighting aspect ratio in early design
   stage, the structure and insulation materials for walls in detailed
   design stages, and the roof title in construction design stages. The
   outcomes of this research can assist in under-standing the importance of
   design variables in each design stage throughout the design process of a
   building.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for almost forty percent of global energy. Due
   to their high consumption of energy, buildings are on the front line of
   sustainability researches. In Turkey, six million out of twenty-two
   million buildings need to be demolished and rebuilt to meet seismic
   standards. These buildings are also far below the standards in terms of
   energy efficiency. Therefore, urban transformation can be thought of as
   a great opportunity for energy efficiency. This study investigates four
   things: (i) the energy-efficient urban transformation strategy in
   Gaziosmanpasa-Istanbul region, which is selected as a case study; (ii)
   the effect of energy efficiency in this market; (iii) the adequacy of
   energy standards of Turkey; and (iv) contribution of digitalization in
   construction to sustainability with Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   and energy analysis. According to the energy efficiency scenarios,
   energy analyses were carried out on the BIM model. The most
   cost-effective strategy was determined with the Life Cycle Cost method.
   When compared with the current situation, it is possible to save energy
   up to 227 GWh a year, which is equal to the annual heating energy demand
   of approximately 30,000 housing, in the case study area with the most
   efficient scenario to be realized.},

Abstract = {The history of the application of life-cycle costing (LCC) began in the
   UK in the late 1950s and, until now, the state of its development as a
   concept is not clear. A literature review is presented that shows the
   changing approaches to LCC by drawing on four major academic journals
   and 45 peer-reviewed papers. The review verifies that there is a revival
   of interest in using LCC in tandem with other life-cycle methodologies
   for research on sustainable building. It also presents a set of methods
   that are applicable to model and estimate the life-cycle costs of
   `conventional' and `green' buildings with the objective of
   distinguishing them. Through the information gathered, it provides a
   centralized source of reference for the assumptions used in LCC
   calculations concerning some key input parameters. The finding shows an
   increasing trend of publications on the evaluation of economic options
   for green building designs and performance. The directions are clear
   that the concepts and methods have to evolve to a state where they will
   help to integrate and optimize economic, social and environmental
   considerations to deliver more sustainable built environments in the
   future.},

Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction industry involves
   multiple disciplines and activities throughout the building life cycle
   stages (BLS). To enable collaboration amongst these disciplines
   iterative and coordinated exchange of information is required. This
   improves the design process over multiple BLS. Since the last decade,
   BIM is a well-known approach to achieve collaboration through semantic
   representation and exchange of domain data. Despite the improvement,
   there is a lack of efficient implementation and management of building
   life cycle functionalities in existing BIM solutions, because of their
   fundamental heterogeneity, complexity, and adaptability. This research
   focuses on these issues and addresses a clear perception through
   analysis of BLS from various standards and norms. The paper concentrates
   on the demonstration of efficient representation of various BLS through
   the ontological approach and their effective involvement in BIM data
   management. With the validation and evaluation through SPARQL queries,
   this paper presents an ontological framework for building life cycle
   data management.},

Title = {Building-information-modeling enabled life cycle assessment, a case
   study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building in China},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle
   to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle
   of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the
   same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA
   results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not
   trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies
   estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase
   quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of
   construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to
   mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually
   estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice
   undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision
   supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart
   transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents
   a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to
   facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC
   transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a
   residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools
   and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and
   interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used
   to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction
   machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and
   simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a
   China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The
   Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73\%) to
   calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent
   database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The
   results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg
   CO(2)eq/m(2). The operation phase contributes to 69\% of the total
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production
   contributes to 24\%. Concrete is the most used building material, which
   accounts for 82\% of mass but contributes to only 44\% of the material
   related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6\%
   and 1.4\% of mass, they contribute to 28\% and 17\% GHG emission,
   respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle
   environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail.
   This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for
   the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of
   buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The building industry has a high energy consumption, which results in
   natural resource depletion, land use, ecosystem degradation, atmospheric
   pollution, and many other environmental impacts. Therefore, in modern
   construction, while maintaining a satisfactory and comfortable interior
   environment, less energy consumption and resource use is a major
   objective of building design. This research explored life cycle energy
   (LCE), life cycle assessment (LCA), and life cycle costing (LCC) to
   evaluate the sustainability performance of building facades for their
   selection. A research framework was proposed considering environmental,
   social, and economic impacts (triple bottom line approach). The proposed
   framework was applied to a medium-rise commercial building in the city
   of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Four building facades (brick, granite,
   aluminum, and glass facades) were selected and compared by their life
   cycle impacts (i.e., impacts in the preuse, use, and posture phases). An
   energy model was developed in DesignBuilder 4.2 to estimate the impact
   of the energy demand of each facade during the operational phase. LCA of
   each facade was performed using SimaPro 8 software. Later, selected
   facades were compared using multicriteria decision analysis for three
   proposed scenarios: proenvironment, neutral, and proeconomic. Based on
   the analysis, brick facade was identified as the most sustainable facade
   in the neutral and proeconomic scenario, whereas a granite facade was
   the most sustainable alternative in the proenvironment scenario. Life
   cycle emergy analysis was conducted to validate the proenvironment
   scenario results. This study provides decision support to architects and
   engineers for the selection of sustainable building facades based on the
   triple bottom line of sustainability. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment and Building Information Modeling Integrated
   Approach: Carbon Footprint of Masonry and Timber-Frame Constructions in
   Single-Family Houses},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {The analysis of the carbon footprint of buildings is a key tool for
   assessing the impact of different buildings on climate change. Several
   frameworks and methodologies are available to calculate the footprint of
   buildings, including standards and norms, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA),
   and dedicated software tools. The use of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) programme for these calculations is both scientifically justified
   and very practical. This scientific publication focuses on the
   application of a BIM-based research methodology to analyse the carbon
   footprint of a single-family house. The research process included the
   following steps: (i) the design of a single-family house with masonry
   construction using Archicad 26, BIM programme, (ii) simulation of the
   building energy performance using the EcoDesigner Star plug-in, (iii)
   LCA using the plug-in for Archicad, (iv) preparation of a second model
   with timber-frame construction for comparison, and (v) comparative
   analysis of the single-family house models with masonry construction
   (building A) and timber-frame (building B). Analysis of the results
   highlights significant differences in CO2e emissions between buildings
   and the varying impact of individual elements on the total CO2e
   emissions of the buildings studied. Building A had significantly higher
   net emissions, amounting to 43,226.94 kg CO2e, in stark contrast to
   Building B's significantly lower 13,522.13 kg CO2e. This discrepancy was
   also mirrored in the emission intensity, with Building A emitting at a
   rate of 281.06 kg CO2e/m2 compared to Building B's 96.72 kg CO2e/m2.
   These findings are relevant for future work on sustainable building
   design and construction aiming to minimise negative environmental
   impacts. The goal of minimising the cumulative carbon footprint of
   buildings is critical to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and
   combating climate change.},

Abstract = {The Industry 4.0 opens to the sector of building constructions a new
   perspective, especially in relation to the digitalization of information
   and to the use of Big Data Analytics to manage them. Gathering data on
   new and existing buildings to provide a more and more complete view on
   the outcomes of the choices of construction, in order to ideally
   optimize the designing process, has already been identified as one of
   the main purposes. Yet, despite the available data are much less, the
   same vision can also make it possible, by enhancing and emphasizing
   monitoring activity in this field, to build another kind of database,
   involving an aspect that is equally crucial for a building and its
   components: the building management phase, that is to say the planning
   of maintenance activities, the cost of which cannot be overlooked.
   Looking ahead to the possibility of developing such database, multiple
   ways of making use of it to guide designers in the choices related to
   life cycle planning, unfold. Considering a necessary step that of
   realizing tools to evaluate such choices according to at least one
   parameter, in order to guide designers towards choices that are
   consistent with their purposes, this work investigates the possibilities
   in this field, and proposes a software tool to elaborate strategies and
   compare them on the basis of the cost parameter. Finally, hypothesis of
   inclusion of this kind of software in a BIM platform are suggested, in a
   view of facility management of BIM 7D.},

Abstract = {The significance of environmental management of existing buildings in
   reducing the environmental impact of the construction sector is
   increasingly emphasized. However, life-cycle assessment (LCA) to
   evaluate a building's environmental burden requires considerable time
   and costs for the collection and interpretation of data needed for
   analysis. Therefore, this study proposed an integrated assessment
   framework of economic, environmental, and human health impacts using
   scan-to-building information modeling (BIM) and LCA in existing
   buildings. To verify the proposed framework, a case study was conducted.
   A BIM model with an error rate of 1.442\% can be automatically generated
   from the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud using parametric algorithm.
   The total cost for the target case was calculated at USD 162,769, and
   the environmental cost accounted for the largest percentage at 97.15\%.
   The developed framework in this study holds significance because it
   enables the automated assessment of economic, environmental, and human
   health impacts of existing buildings through the integration of BIM and
   LCA.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a comprehensive environmental assessment
   approach has been widely adopted to evaluate the environmental impacts
   of many building materials. However, only a few life cycle inventories
   (LCIs) have been developed in certain countries with prevailing
   boundaries and scopes which prevent them from being applied directly to
   a different location. Therefore utilizations of overseas LCI with valid
   modification have become an effective way to expand the usage of
   existing LCI as well as to quickly establish a localized inventory. This
   study aims to develop a framework which makes use of non local LCI data
   and Building Information Modelling (BIM) to evaluate the environmental
   impact of local construction materials-specifically, total carbon
   emissions from the ``cradle to site{''} process of construction
   materials. Framework inputs, outputs and data conversion methods are
   analysed in a detailed manner. A case study in Singapore which focuses
   on carbon emissions generated from cement production and transportation
   is employed to showcase the application of the proposed framework in LCA
   practice. The result obtained was compared with the actual benchmark to
   validate the framework's performance. The estimated percentage of error
   was 2\%, which is much smaller than the one from raw LCI of 14\%.
   Discussion and sensitivity analysis regarding to the robustness of the
   results in the presence of uncertainty have also been discussed. The
   result can expand the existing knowledge of cross-boundary LCI usage for
   construction materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing economic and environmental performance of infill materials
   through BIM: a life cycle approach},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 4},
Abstract = {PurposeInfill materials play a pivotal role in determining buildings'
   life cycle costing (LCC) and environmental impacts. International
   standards prescribe LCC and life cycle assessments (LCA) to assess
   materials' economic and environmental sustainability. The existing
   methods of LCC and LCA are tedious and time-consuming, reducing their
   practical application. This study sought to integrate LCC and LCA with
   building information modeling (BIM) to develop a swift and efficient
   approach for evaluating the life cycle performance of infill
   materials.Design/methodology/approachThe BIM model for a case study was
   prepared using Autodesk Revit (R), and the study included four infill
   materials (lightweight aggregate concrete block (LECA), autoclaved
   cellular concrete (AAC), concrete masonry and bricks). LCC was conducted
   using Revit (R) and Autodesk Insight 360 (R) to estimate costs incurred
   across different project phases. LCA was conducted using ``One Click LCA
   (R),{''} a BIM-based platform featuring a comprehensive material
   inventory. Carbon emissions, acidification, and eutrophication were
   chosen as environmental impact factors for LCA.FindingsLECA was the
   preferred choice due to its lower cost and environmental impact. Its
   lifetime cost of \$440,618 was 5.4\% lower than bricks', with 2.8\%
   lower CO2 emissions than AAC's, which were second-place options,
   respectively. LECA had 6.4 and 27\% lower costs than concrete blocks,
   and AAC's carbon emissions were 32 and 58\% lower than concrete blocks
   and bricks, respectively.Originality/valueBIM has been employed for life
   cycle analysis in existing literature, but its efficacy in evaluating
   the lifetime costs and environmental impacts of infill materials remains
   unexplored. The current study presents a BIM-based approach for
   conducting LCC and LCA of infill materials, facilitating informed
   decision-making during the planning phase and promoting sustainable
   construction practices.},

Abstract = {According to the National Institute of Building Science (2006),. one of
   the main goals of building commissioning is to ``maintain facility
   performance across its life cycle{''}. In recent years, the maturing of
   sensing technology has helped to advance this vision through
   sensor-assisted building commissioning. For residential projects,
   however, the overhead associated with long-term sensor performance and
   quality assurance and sensor data analysis creates a barrier that
   diminishes the benefit of such technological advancement.
   This paper describes how the principles of complex system theory can be
   applied to address these issues in the context of residential building.
   Two cases are presented. First case demonstrates the application of
   ``scale{''} and ``format{''}' that underline the idea of ``bounded
   rationality{''} in dealing with imperfect sensor data. Second case
   refers to the idea of ``decomposable hierarchical system'{''} as the
   framework for building system information modeling to reduce the level
   of difficulty for resident's participation in life cycle commissioning.},

Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings use lighter materials and have lower embodied
   impacts than conventional buildings. Previous studies assessed mainly
   energy and carbon, or a specific life cycle stage. However, increased
   operational energy can compromise the lower embodied impacts of
   lightweight prefabricated buildings, so a comprehensive life cycle
   assessment is required. This article assessed a lightweight
   prefabricated house for seven house locations (addressing transport,
   climate, and electricity mix), three insulation levels, and two heat
   pumps. A life cycle model was developed for a prefabricated one-bedroom
   house with a steel structure, addressing materials, transport to plant,
   modular prefabrication, transport to site, onsite assemblage, and use
   stage. A building information model (BIM) was integrated with the life
   cycle model to obtain the bill of materials, perform the energy
   simulation, and build the life cycle inventory. This comprehensive
   assessment includes abiotic resource depletion, abiotic depletion of
   fossil fuels, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical
   oxidation, acidification, eutrophication, and nonrenewable energy
   categories. Results show that embodied impacts for the Mediterranean and
   tropical climates are significant (up to 60\%) for most impact
   categories. Prefabricated buildings should have different insulation
   levels: low level in a tropical climate, medium level in the
   Mediterranean, and high level in the EU continental region. Lightweight
   prefabricated buildings use fewer materials and can have lower embodied
   and operational impacts than heavyweight conventional, thus reducing the
   overall life cycle impacts of the building sector.},

Title = {Carbon emission reduction in prefabrication construction during
   materialization stage: A BIM-based life-cycle assessment approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Prefabrication has gained its popularity in countries including China
   due to its various advantages such as quality control, waste reduction,
   onsite and offsite parallel coordination, and so on. It has also been
   recognized as a key strategy to reduce construction-induced carbon
   emissions. However, there is limited research to examine carbon emission
   reduction in prefabrication by using the advanced technological
   artefacts, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), emerging from the
   technology sphere. As a digital representation of a facility, BIM
   provides a cyber platform based on which many assessment and simulation
   works can be performed without having to construct the physical
   facility. This paper aims to develop a BIM-based approach to measuring
   carbon emission reduction during the materialization stage of a
   prefabricated building project. Findings from the study indicate that
   BIM is an efficient and effective method for measuring carbon emissions
   from the construction of new buildings and that prefabrication reduces
   carbon emissions when compared with conventional construction methods.
   The research contributes to the body of knowledge relating to the
   reduction of carbon emissions through prefabrication. This is pertinent
   to contractors, homebuyers and governments who are constantly seeking
   ways to achieve a circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {BIM-VE-Based Optimization of Green Building Envelope from the
   Perspective of both Energy Saving and Life Cycle Cost},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the context of the increasingly severe energy crisis and global
   warming, green buildings and their energy-saving issues are being paid
   more attention in the world. Since envelope optimization can
   significantly reduce the energy consumption of green buildings, value
   engineering (VE) technology and building information modeling (BIM)
   technology are used to optimize the envelope of green buildings, which
   takes into account both energy saving and life cycle cost. The
   theoretical framework of optimization for green building envelope based
   on BIM-VE is proposed, including a BIM model for architecture, a life
   cycle cost analysis model, energy-saving analysis model, and a value
   analysis model. In the life-cycle cost model, a mathematical formula for
   the life-cycle cost is established, and BIM technology is used to
   generate a bill of quantity. In the energy-saving analysis model, a
   mathematical formula for energy saving is established, and BIM
   technology is used for the building energy simulation. In the scheme
   decision-making sub-model, VE technology integrating life cycle cost
   with energy saving is used to assess the envelope schemes and select the
   optimal one. A prefabricated project case is used to simulate and test
   the established methodology. The important results show that the 16
   envelope schemes make the 16 corresponding designed buildings meet the
   green building evaluation standards, and the optimal envelope scheme is
   the ``energy-saving and anti-theft door + exterior window 2+ floor 1+
   exterior wall 1 + inner shear wall + inner partition wall 2 + planted
   roof{''} with the value 10.80 x 10(-2) MW center dot h/ten thousand
   yuan. A significant finding is that the value generally rises with the
   increase of energy-saving rate while the life cycle cost is irregular
   with the increase of energy-saving rate. Compared with previous efforts
   in the literature, this study introduces VE technology into
   architectural design to further expand the current boundary of building
   energy-saving theory. The findings and suggestions will provide a
   valuable reference and guidance for the architectural design industry to
   optimize the envelope of green buildings from the perspective of both
   energy saving and life cycle cost.},

Abstract = {Ensuring sustainability for real estate is subject - among other aspects
   - to building related information. This information needs to be stored
   and updated continuously throughout the life cycle of a building. A
   delivery to buyers, tenants, consultants or other actors must be
   possible at any time. However, in most cases transactions cause
   significant loss of information while the issues associated with the
   ``building passport{''} approach remains unsolved to date. Considering
   the long service life of buildings, various questions arise: (1) How to
   support data generation and storage within the life cycle and how to
   encourage actors to compete? (2) How to assure a high data quality and
   how to store it over a long period of time? (3) How to assure that all
   data users can track down the data owners at any point of time to manage
   compliance and legal issues? (4) Are there any new business models or
   new scopes for designers or other service providers? Information needs
   of actors along the life cycle are analysed and new information
   technologies (e.g. blockchain) are discussed. A relation to Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) is shown. Potentials of enhancing existing
   approaches regarding documentation retracing and accessibility of
   building and life cycle related information by using new technologies
   and IT are discussed; benefits of using a blockchain based system is
   pointed out by referring to existing pilot projects and first examples.
   Solution approaches for building passports are shown.},

Title = {The BIM2LCA Approach: An Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-Based
   Interface to Integrate Life Cycle Assessment in Integral Planning},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An increasing degree of digitalization in construction planning offers
   significant potential for building life cycle assessment (LCA) to reduce
   access barriers, as well as the assessment effort itself. To realize the
   widespread application of LCA tools and their potential to effectively
   minimize life cycle impacts, an open approach is required that allows
   for flexible application of comprehensive LCA studies and early
   integration in planning processes. The authors present an approach for
   LCA integration in all phases of digital planning which aims at a DGNB
   (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur nachhaltiges Bauen) certification based on
   the open Building Information Modeling (BIM) standard Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC). The approach takes into account varying levels
   of development and resulting data availability during integral planning
   phases, as well as resulting LCA application contexts. It goes beyond
   existing strategies and allows one to consider both BIM and LCA software
   through a workflow based on a single data format. The assessment
   framework is operationalized through standardized interface development
   and technical realization following the information delivery manual
   (IDM) process standardized for IFC interfaces. The Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) schema, as a specific implementation for certification,
   provides the target system for LCA data requirements and is generalized
   to a planning phase specific IDM base table. The technical realization
   based on respective model view definitions and distributed data suggests
   a pathway to the standardization of LCA-IFC integration based on an open
   approach. The overall approach exemplarily applies to the
   ``LERNZENTRUM{''} at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) campus.
   We conclude that an open BIM approach for LCA integration in model-based
   planning is feasible, but requires several adjustments in IFC, LCA, and
   planning practice. Adding a lifecycle element to the IFC to connect BIM
   and LCA provides comprehensive feedback for informed decision making
   based on environmental impact.},

Abstract = {The construction and building sector is one of the largest contributors
   to the global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to
   accurately assess the carbon emissions of buildings throughout the life
   cycle. Many studies conducted life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings
   to evaluate carbon emissions. However, due to the lack of dynamic data,
   most studies adopted the static LCA methodology, which neglected the
   dynamic variations during life cycle stages of a building. Unlike
   previous studies that collected static data from questionnaires and
   documents, the present study aims to establish a novel dynamic life
   cycle assessment (D-LCA) framework for buildings by incorporating the
   building information modeling (BIM) and the building energy modeling
   program (BEMP) into the static LCA. First, a static LCA is established
   as the baseline scenario that covers the ``cradle-to-grave{''} life
   cycle stages. A BIM model is established using Revit to obtain the
   inventory of building materials. The Designer Simulation Toolkit (DeST)
   is used as a BEMP to simulate the operating energy consumption of the
   studied building, taking into account changes in energy mix, climate
   change, and occupant behavior. At the same time, the DeST results are
   further used as a data input for dynamic scenarios. The D-LCA framework
   is applied to a high-rise commercial building in China. This study found
   that the difference between static and dynamic},

Abstract = {In the last few years, particular focus has been devoted to the life
   cycle performance of fastening systems, which is reflected in increasing
   numbers of publications, standards and large-scale research efforts.
   Simultaneously, experience shows that in many cases, where fastening
   systems are implemented - such as industrial facilities the design of
   fasteners is governed by fatigue loading under dynamic characteristics.
   In order to perform an adequate design and to specify the most efficient
   and appropriate fastening product, the engineer needs to access and
   process a broad range of technical and commercial information. Building
   information modelling (BIM), as a data management method in the
   construction industry, can supply such information and accommodate a
   comprehensive design and specification process. Furthermore, the
   application of BIM-based processes, such as the generation of a
   BIM-model, allows to use the important information for the construction
   as well as the life cycle management with different actions and time
   dependencies of the asset and its components. As a consequence, the BIM
   model offers the potential to correlate different data relevant for
   achieving the goals of the respective application, in order to ensure a
   more effective and correct design of the fastening. This paper
   demonstrates such a BIM-based design framework for an Industry 4.0 case,
   and in particular, the installation of a factory robot through
   post-installed anchors under fatigue-relevant loading in concrete.},

Abstract = {The use of wood and engineered wood products is today considered an
   opportunity for the mitigation of negative building environmental
   impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions. However, the literature
   provides evidence that the quantification and generalization of the
   environmental benefits of wood during the whole building life cycle can
   be difficult. This paper presents a quantitative method based on Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare, during their design stages, the
   environmental impacts produced by a timber-frame single-family house
   versus those of a concrete-masonry-based house built in Uruguay. The
   method, conceived as a decision-oriented tool, integrates Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and LCA to quantify and compare the
   environmental impacts of one of the most common dwelling typologies in
   Uruguay. The results of the cradle-to-grave assessment show that the
   timber-frame building produced the lowest impacts in Global Warming
   Potential, Human Toxicity, Acidification Potential, Ozone Depletion
   Potential, and Freshwater Ecotoxicity, but yielded the highest impacts
   in Eutrophication Potential. The findings also show that the method
   developed herein facilitated the comparison and contrast between the
   pros and cons of both design options during their design stages. (C)

Abstract = {Buildings consume a tremendous amount of the total use of secondary
   energy resulting in a considerable impact on the environment. Therefore,
   it is necessary to reduce their energy consumption by improving the
   design of new buildings or renovating existing buildings. However,
   renovating building envelopes and energy systems to lessen energy losses
   is usually expensive and has a long payback period. Despite the
   significant contribution of the research about optimizing energy
   consumption, there is limited research focusing on the renovation of
   existing buildings to minimize their environmental impact using Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA). This study aims to develop a methodology to
   optimize the energy performance of existing buildings by selecting the
   optimal renovation strategies considering LCA. Different scenarios can
   be combined in a building renovation strategy to improve energy
   efficiency. Each scenario considers several factors including
   improvement of the building envelopes, Heating, Ventilation, and Air
   Conditioning (HVAC) systems, and local energy generation systems.
   However, some of these scenarios could be inconsistent and should be
   eliminated. Another consideration in this research is the appropriate
   coupling of renovation scenarios. For example, the HVAC system must be
   redesigned when renovating the building envelope to consider the reduced
   energy demand and to avoid undesirable side effects. A genetic algorithm
   (GA) coupled with an energy simulation tool is used for simultaneously
   minimizing the energy consumption and the LCA of the building. The
   simulation tool is used to calculate the energy consumption for each
   potential solution representing one renovation scenario. The data of the
   building characteristics are extracted from the Building Information
   Model (BIM). The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated
   using a case study focusing on the buildings of Concordia University.},

Abstract = {In the context of the digital and sustainable transformation of building
   projects, the integrated approach of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely studied. Recent
   advancements in such integrated modeling processes and techniques have
   not yet provided reliable and robust decision-making capabilities for
   designers to intuitively choose between material alternatives. This
   study develops a new design framework that integrates BIM, LCA, and
   multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) algorithms to facilitate
   sustainable design processes in building projects. A case study using a
   single-family housing project in the British Columbia province of Canada
   was implemented to test the designs to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed integrated framework, including a three-way comparison of
   design scenarios-conventional hot-roll steel, recycled steel, and
   timber. The results indicate a significant performance improvement with
   the adoption of recycled structural steel materials, surpassing
   conventional steel designs and demonstrating a similar performance to
   that of timber designs. The study underscores the importance of informed
   decision-making in material selection, driven by the quantitative
   analysis of digital designs and multi-criteria evaluation (e.g., social
   carbon cost). This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for
   designers, engineers, and builders to achieve sustainability when
   designing building projects through the systematic and rapid comparison
   of environmental performance.},

Title = {BIM-driven optimization of life cycle cost in seismic design of urban

Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},

Abstract = {The predominant strategy in structural design is based on reducing the
   initial weight of the structure, while potential future costs due to,
   for instance, earthquake damage might be overlooked. This strategy means
   that no life cycle cost (LCC) assessment is performed over the design
   process. Yet, while many studies have addressed the LCC-based design of
   regular structures under earthquake loads, rare studies have applied it
   to irregular structures. Furthermore, the lack of utilization of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) capabilities in previous LCC-based
   design is evident. This study aims to highlight the impact of
   irregularity on optimizing the LCC of high-rise steel structures by
   providing an optimization framework for seismic design of regular and
   irregular structures integrating the capabilities of LCC and BIM. Using
   BIM, it is possible to significantly reduce the limitations of LCC
   analysis, such as time spent in data collection and exchange, and to
   increase the accuracy and speed of calculations. The framework here
   first combines results of different architectural and structural
   software through programming within MATLAB environment and then uses
   NSGA-II algorithm for establishing a trade-off between initial cost and
   LCC. To check the workability of the framework, six 3D tall steel
   structures, with 10-, 13-, and 20-floors, in two categories of regular
   and setback irregular are first designed for gravity and seismic loads
   and their performance using non-linear analyses are then analyzed. The
   results showed that the indirect costs of irregular structures were
   relatively higher than regular ones while higher initial cost needed to
   reduce LCC. For example, for both the 20-story regular and irregular
   structures, a 15\% increase in initial costs resulted in a 24 and 17\%
   reduction in their LCCs, respectively. Given that irregular structures
   are more susceptible to sustaining earthquake damage than regular ones,
   the proposed framework here can further provide the economic viability
   of irregular structures from an LCC-based perspective.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the development process of an innovative,
   prefabricated compact house, which aims at creating a net zero
   greenhouse gas emission building design over the whole life cycle.
   Building Information Modelling helped to quantify the required building
   materials. Dynamic building simulations were performed in DesignBuilder
   to calculate the energy demand of the building for the operational
   period. To evaluate the financial feasibility and the carbon balance of
   the building, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were used. A
   heat and moisture transfer simulation was carried out to provide a more
   accurate analysis and to identify possible moisture problems.The
   assessment showed that the ratio of embodied impacts and operational
   impacts is typically 1:2 for wooden buildings and 1:1.5 for brick
   buildings. Life cycle carbon neutrality could be achieved in both cases
   with additional photovoltaic panels installed on the roof. However, a
   major difference between timber and brick buildings is the time factor:
   while the initial emissions from the production of brick buildings are
   gradually offset with excess solar energy, timber buildings act as
   carbon storage with negative emissions over the study period and the
   carbon is only released at the eventual end -of-life stage. The
   necessary size of photovoltaics is largely influenced by the avoided
   grid impact: if dynamic decarbonization of the electricity mix is
   considered, the size of photovoltaics required is about 1.5 times larger
   to offset the environmental load of the construction due to the
   diminishing benefits.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Dealing with uncertainties in comparative building life cycle assessment},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Building LCA aims at guiding designers towards more sustainable
   projects. Many sources of uncertainties affect environmental modelling.
   Therefore, the reliability of decisions based on building LCA is
   questioned. However, information on uncertainties can strengthen
   decisions, when properly addressed. In this study, seven statistical
   metrics are compared based on dependent samplings for sensitivity
   analyses (SA) and uncertainty analyses (UA). It allows to identify a set
   of indicators on which conclusions are more reliable. For the first
   time, this method-ology is applied to comparative building LCA,
   considering three construction alternatives: a concrete, a concrete
   blocks and a wooden-framed house. A new SA method, based on Morris,
   helps identifying which of 153 uncertain factors are more likely to
   influence decisions. More precise data is then collected on these
   uncertain factors. In this case study, the Heijungs significance metric
   and the distribution of relative differences were the most appropriate
   metrics to assess UA results. They allow to determine, for each
   indicator, which is the best alternative and how much better it
   performs. Consequently, the non-conclusive indicators are discarded.
   Applying this methodology, decision are enhanced by uncertainties and
   rely on a smaller set of indicators to select an alter-native in terms
   of environmental performance.},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing concentration of Carbon footprint into the
   environment has drastically changed the climatic conditions. Among many
   anthropogenic activities, the housing sector remains one of the major
   contributors. However, a complete assessment of these environmental
   impacts throughout the life cycle still remains an area of concern. Most
   of the study does not assess the impacts by each phase of lifecycle. The
   current work presents a complete approach for carbon footprint
   assessment including planning, construction, operational, maintenance
   and dismantling \& dispose-off phase. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with
   boundary limitations of `cradle to grave' was adopted. Thirteen housing
   units were selected as case study. These included detached,
   semi-detached and terraced types of construction. Selected units were
   developed in a virtual environment using Building Information Modeling
   (BIM). The study observed the average contribution range from 1.48
   tons-CO2/yr to 2.85 tons-CO2/yr. On individual basis, the execution
   phase dominated the five phases with almost 43 \%. The operational phase
   shared 39 \% followed by maintenance (15 \%), dismantling \& dispose-off
   (1.8 \%) and planning at the last (1.5 \%). The categorization of
   environmental impact into embodied and operational carbon footprint
   observed the embodied part in dominance. A strong positive relationship
   between the area of housing units and resulting carbon impact was also
   observed. The work presents one of few environmental studies for a
   tropical housing sector assessing complete life cycle. The study
   provides a vital guideline to the designers for ensuring a sustainable
   environment by assessing and opting less carbon intensive options at
   early stage of planning and design.},

Abstract = {The present article intends to contextualize the relevance of a linkage
   between BIM methodology and the COBie specification, identify the
   challenges and design guidelines for its implementation in structural
   rehabilitation projects. COBie specification encompasses several
   engineering projects of the constructive process, so generic files are
   listed for their integration into the stability engineering project and
   identified the type of information contained. Considerations that
   highlight the importance of the link between BIM methodology and the
   COBie specification are presented. However, cultural change that is
   needed within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation
   (AECO) sector are still a challenge.},

Abstract = {Improving the environmental impact of the construction industry is a
   very significant way to achieve sustainability. The combination of
   building information modeling and life cycle assessment leads to improve
   the environmental performance of buildings. However, preliminary
   measures to achieve sustainability require complete knowledge and
   classification of building information modeling uses and environmental
   indicators. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify and prioritize
   building information modeling capabilities and environmental indicators
   in the early stages of design. A questionnaire was designed to survey
   experts in this field. By evaluating the building information modeling
   criteria and life cycle evaluation, using the Structural equation
   modeling method, it was found that 3D coordination, Phase planning, and
   Design reviews are the most important in the success of the project. In
   terms of life cycle assessment, control, and reduction indicators of
   Global Warming Potential, Land use impact, and Total Primary Energy, it
   has the greatest impact on improving the sustainable performance of a
   construction project. We also examined the interaction between the most
   effective building information modeling criteria and life cycle
   evaluation using the Delphi method. This approach improved project
   sustainability performance by reducing time, cost, resource consumption,
   and environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {Building life cycle is a process which covers not only the construction
   phase but also the feasibility, the de- sign and the operation phases.
   Identifying the owner's needs in all phases of this process is of
   paramount importance for achieving satisfactory results for the building
   project. Additionally, the owner's needs should be fulfilled by the work
   scope of every stakeholder involved in the project. Nevertheless, these
   needs are not always adequately considered in building projects. Thus,
   the purpose of the research reported in this paper has been to develop a
   model that allows for the identification of the owner's needs in all
   phases of the building life cycle. The article presents a six level
   classifica- tion system for the information required in the project and
   a two-dimensional model that maps the life cycle and the logical actions
   to be undertaken in each phase. The model has been corroborated and
   improved by applying the Delphi technique to a panel of ten experts in
   two rounds. The practical use of the model is through the systematic
   application of a series of questionnaires built upon the information
   classification system for determining the owner's needs. The paper
   details the operation phase of the model as an illustrative example and
   a case study on a residential building project of twelve apartments in
   Spain.},

Title = {Sustainable material choice for construction projects: A Life Cycle
   Sustainability Assessment framework based on BIM and Fuzzy-AHP},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Construction professionals and researchers are increasingly looking for
   sustainable solutions for buildings in a bid to reduce some of the
   negative impacts associated with the sector. A common misconception is
   to consider sustainability as only concerning environmental issues,
   without regard for the interaction between a triple bottom line
   framework that is comprised of social, economic, and environmental
   factors. Material choice is known to impact building sustainability
   directly since the use of certain materials can dramatically alter the
   footprint generated over the life cycle of the building. However, the
   construction industry is not yet equipped with approaches that
   simultaneously account for all three aspects of sustainability when it
   comes to deciding on materials to adopt. This paper proposes a
   decision-making framework for construction professionals and researchers
   involving the integration of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment
   (LCSA), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to choose suitable materials for buildings.
   The framework is built based on a literature review of relevant papers
   to identify critical factors and challenges to implementing this
   integration. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was chosen as the MCDA
   method within the proposed framework, given that the problem of material
   choice often contains subjectivity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which is
   best solved with fuzzy logic. A residential building was adopted as a
   case study to validate the proposed framework, and the LCSA method is
   applied, covering the construction, operation, and end-of-life phases of
   the building.},

Abstract = {As a witness of history, built heritage has many values that is very
   important to human being. Therefore, how to conserve this valuable
   information becomes a common issue for cultural heritage conservation in
   the world. Many researches about conserving the information of within
   built heritages were done and more issues were raised. The difference
   between built heritage and new building is that built heritage is not
   from 0 but it is already exist. This difference cause a big different
   for modelling process of built heritage in BIM environment. For this
   reason, the information of the 3D model of built heritage is added to
   the model after the it was created. So, what information should be
   conserve and what information should be provided to which user is worth
   of discussion. This research aims to propose a data structure, which
   fulfils the requirement of user, and respect the standard of important
   international chart of conservation. The method is to define a basic
   data structure of built heritage components and evaluate it layer by
   layer. The result shows that HBIM for built heritage, by linking
   information, can store more important information and take the LoI of
   life cycle into consideration simultaneously. The prototypical schema of
   this study may possibly be an upper layer concept for later researches
   in both Western and Eastern built heritage.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for buildings has not been widely applied
   because of its complexity and time-consuming nature. Several studies
   have been trying to address this issue by the use of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Parametric tools, which enable them to
   face specific issues arising on projects. Amongst the different research
   efforts, one can perceive a gap in the field. This gap lies in the
   insufficient understanding of the methodological approaches and tools
   best suited to carry out environmental analysis. The novelty of the
   paper is to compare the paradigms and scope of most common used BIM and
   Parametric approach for LCA. This leads to an enhanced awareness on how
   to apply both trending phenomena to increase their features and reduce
   the limitations.},

Abstract = {In the context of the general trend to accelerate change, the actual
   goal of scientific research in the field of construction is to analyze
   and design the stages of the life cycle of a construction object. The
   object of the study becomes the information model of the life cycle of
   the building. It is studied and modeled based on the concept of real
   estate development and using the methods of project analysis of the
   construction project. The widest possibilities for obtaining and
   analyzing data on the state of a construction object, as well as the
   possibilities of systematizing information flows and information
   modeling of different periods of its life cycle, are realized in the
   approach of BIM modeling of buildings and structures. With the help of
   BIM-modeling tools, mandatory stages and possible phases of the life
   cycle of a building object can be represented as hierarchically and
   sequentially related information flows, in which the attributes of each
   stage of the life cycle are formed under the influence of the preceding
   stages and of special factors for the considered stage. As a result, the
   project documentation should reflect the decisions aimed at providing
   the necessary conditions and opportunities for subsequent periods of the
   life cycle of the construction object, as well as the most adapted for
   the predicted changes and transformations for all future stages and
   phases. The analysis of characteristics and the developed structure of
   simple and complex construction works allows determining for each stage
   and phase of the life cycle of a construction object: interconnection of
   information flows, composition and content of the information model of
   the building required for the work of specialists.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research
   trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research.
   Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current
   research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review
   methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research
   publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and
   retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA
   applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research.
   Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified,
   which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and
   discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively
   control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such
   mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new
   generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and
   continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective
   operation and management strategies of buildings and districts.
   Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system
   modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant
   emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently
   missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life
   cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent
   characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA
   results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept
   of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and
   spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and
   thus more effectively promotes a ``cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation{''}
   environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to
   leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic
   models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable

Title = {Demolishing or Renovating? Life Cycle Analysis in the Design Process for
   Building Renovation: The ProGETonE Case},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {It is well known that a large part of the existing European building
   stock needs to be renovated to increase structural and energy
   performance. Unfortunately, deep renovations come with high initial
   costs, and therefore, owners and real estate developers often prefer
   complete demolition and reconstruction. Both options depend on specific
   factors, and to select which option could be the closest to the optimal
   scenario, it is necessary to evaluate all environmental, social, and
   economic indicators. Life Cycle Analysis is of great significance to
   evaluate building sustainability, in particular through the comparison
   between different design alternatives. However, the life cycle impacts
   of the construction stage depend on selected materials and technologies
   that can be subject to change during the subsequent stages of the design
   process, i.e., moving from preliminary design to detailed design and
   execution plans. With the aim of understanding the role of LCA during
   the design process, the case study of ``ProGETonE-Proactive Synergy of
   Integrated Efficient Technologies on Buildings' Envelopes{''} has been
   addressed, leading to the observation that the impacts, in particular
   the global warming potential (GWP), raised significantly. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) helped the information sharing and
   management of this project, which consists of the deep renovation and
   architectural reshaping of an existing student residence through the
   construction of integrated facade systems.},

Title = {Utilization of an Automatic Tool for Building Material Selection by
   Integrating Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in the Early Design
   Stages in BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Recent international scientific studies have described the current
   situation regarding CO2 emissions and have provided evidence of its
   catastrophic short- and medium-term consequences. The implementation of
   solutions of a more sustainable nature to reduce and mitigate this
   situation is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, the integration
   of multi-dimension and life cycle assessment into the design process of
   buildings can help and support decision making. Life Cycle
   Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is one of the scientific community's
   most widely recognized methodologies for this purpose, combining the
   evaluation of the social, economic, and social dimensions (Triple Bottom
   Line). One of the main obstacles to implementing this methodology lies
   in the difficulties in automatically comparing alternative design
   options for the selection of different materials. To overcome this
   limitation, the authors developed the BIM3LCA (Building Information
   Modelling Three Life Cycle Assessment) tool conceived to guide the
   decision-making process during the early design steps. This study
   introduces a Building Information Modelling (BIM) plug-in development
   and validates its application in a case study to support the
   multi-criteria building material selection based on the LCSA
   implementation at the early design stage. Three building material
   alternatives for the structural system of a multi-family residential
   building are employed to validate this plug-in. The results show the
   viability of using this tool during the early design stages and
   demonstrates the consistency of the results regarding the use of the BIM
   model to conduct the LCSA. The study discusses the benefits and
   limitations of the BIM3LCA tool. This research contributes towards the
   integration of multi-dimension real-time assessment in the building
   design process by using semantically rich BIM models.},

Title = {Dynamic life cycle assessment: framework and application to an

Abstract = {This paper uses a dynamic life cycle assessment (DLCA) approach and
   illustrates the potential importance of the method using a simplified
   case study of an institutional building. Previous life cycle assessment
   (LCA) studies have consistently found that energy consumption in the use
   phase of a building is dominant in most environmental impact categories.
   Due to the long life span of buildings and potential for changes in
   usage patterns over time, a shift toward DLCA has been suggested.
   We define DLCA as an approach to LCA which explicitly incorporates
   dynamic process modeling in the context of temporal and spatial
   variations in the surrounding industrial and environmental systems. A
   simplified mathematical model is used to incorporate dynamic information
   from the case study building, temporally explicit sources of life cycle
   inventory data and temporally explicit life cycle impact assessment
   characterization factors, where available. The DLCA model was evaluated
   for the historical and projected future environmental impacts of an
   existing institutional building, with additional scenario development
   for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of future impacts.
   Results showed that overall life cycle impacts varied greatly in some
   categories when compared to static LCA results, generated from the
   temporal perspective of either the building's initial construction or
   its recent renovation. From the initial construction perspective,
   impacts in categories related to criteria air pollutants were reduced by
   more than 50 \% when compared to a static LCA, even though nonrenewable
   energy use increased by 15 \%. Pollution controls were a major reason
   for these reductions. In the future scenario analysis, the baseline DLCA
   scenario showed a decrease in all impact categories compared with the
   static LCA. The outer bounds of the sensitivity analysis varied from
   slightly higher to strongly lower than the static results, indicating
   the general robustness of the decline across the scenarios.
   These findings support the use of dynamic modeling in life cycle
   assessment to increase the relevance of results. In some cases, decision
   making related to building design and operations may be affected by
   considering the interaction of temporally explicit information in
   multiple steps of the LCA. The DLCA results suggest that in some cases,
   changes during a building's lifetime can influence the LCA results to a
   greater degree than the material and construction phases. Adapting LCA
   to a more dynamic approach may increase the usefulness of the method in
   assessing the performance of buildings and other complex systems in the
   built environment.},

   Information Modeling and Life Cycle Assessment for the Construction of

Abstract = {Buildings produce a large amount of carbon emissions in their life
   cycle, which intensifies greenhouse-gas effects and has become a great
   threat to the survival of humans and other species. Although many
   previous studies shed light on the calculation of carbon emissions, a
   systematic analysis framework is still missing. Therefore, this study
   proposes an analysis framework of carbon emissions based on building
   information modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA), which
   consists of four steps: (1) defining the boundary of carbon emissions in
   a life cycle; (2) establishing a carbon emission coefficients database
   for Chinese buildings and adopting Revit, GTJ2018, and Green Building
   Studio for inventory analysis; (3) calculating carbon emissions at each
   stage of the life cycle; and (4) explaining the calculation results of
   carbon emissions. The framework developed is validated using a case
   study of a hospital project, which is located in areas in Anhui, China
   with a hot summer and a cold winter. The results show that the
   reinforced concrete engineering contributes to the largest proportion of
   carbon emissions (around 49.64\%) in the construction stage, and the
   HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) generates the largest
   proportion (around 53.63\%) in the operational stage. This study
   provides a practical reference for similar buildings in analogous areas
   and for additional insights on reducing carbon emissions in the future.},

Title = {Integrated life-cycle optimisation and supply-side management for
   building retrofitting},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building retrofitting is a powerful approach to enhance building energy
   performance. The net-zero ambition urges the need to renovate building
   energy system in view of the life-cycle optimal, to address climate and
   environmental challenges. Existing retrofitting and optimisation
   solutions are generally based upon minimising operational energy or
   cost. However, although building retrofitting can reduce the energy use
   at the operating phase, additional materials would result in increased
   embodied energy. The objective of this paper is to devise a novel
   building retrofitting approach through the integration of life-cycle
   optimisation and supply-side management. It is an interactive two-set
   optimisation approach aimed at minimising overall life-cycle energy
   consumption through determining the optimal design configuration and
   operating plan of retrofitting energy devices. The essential
   retrofitting energy devices include passive retrofitting options (i.e.,
   photovoltaic panel and solar thermal collector) and active retrofitting
   options (i.e., biomass boiler, ground source heat pump, heat storage,
   electricity storage, and cogeneration system). A modern 3-floor office
   building in Manchester, the United Kingdom, is adopted to assess the
   performance of the proposed refurbishment approach. The real-world
   situation is represented by historical electricity and gas consumption
   profiles, current building design information, historical weather
   profile, as well as life-cycle inventory information. The proposed
   retrofitting optimisation approach can help decision-makers select the
   optimal retrofitting solution so as to reduce the overall life-cycle
   energy consumption of office buildings.},

Title = {Analysis of the Impact of Photovoltaic Curtain Walls Replacing Glass
   Curtain Walls on the Whole Life Cycle Carbon Emission of Public
   Buildings Based on BIM Modeling Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {The construction industry plays a crucial role in achieving global
   carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study is to explore the
   application of photovoltaic curtain walls in building models and analyze
   their impact on carbon emissions in order to find the best adaptation
   method that combines economy and carbon reduction. Through a carbon
   emissions calculation and economic analysis of replacing photovoltaic
   curtain walls on a large public building in Zhenjiang, China, the
   results showed that after replacing glass curtain walls with
   photovoltaic curtain walls, the carbon emissions during the construction
   operation stage decreased by 30.74\%, but the carbon emissions during
   the production and transportation stage of building materials increased
   by 10.48\%. The carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of the
   building have been reduced by 20.99\%. This indicates that photovoltaic
   curtain wall technology has the potential to reduce building carbon
   emissions. Further promoting the development of production technology
   and sales routes for photovoltaic curtain walls and accelerating the
   improvement of carbon trading systems can further improve the carbon
   emission reduction effect of buildings. This study provides practical
   reference for public buildings in similar areas and guidance for
   reducing carbon emissions in the future.},

Abstract = {In this on research-based article, models presented further are
   representing complex concepts and facilitating their understanding. The
   models describe the categorization of the recorded knowledge obtained
   from the analysis of the monitored processes. Some of these models are
   descriptive (for example, the Venn diagram representing the
   interconnection of BIM spaces), others are predictive (e.g. a model
   representing the effects of BIM on the life cycle of a project), and
   others will be instructive-clarifying the sequence of actions that
   follow on to achieve a predefined output, such as a workflow model,
   representing authorization, identification, classification, aggregation,
   and usage. We can look at BIM as a framework modelling set of minimal
   sets of principles needed to model the basic building characteristics,
   along with a clear categorization of knowledge in identified and
   recorded models. Taxonomy is an effective and efficient way to organize
   and consolidate knowledge. A well-structured taxonomy allows for
   ``meaningful gathering of experience{''}. As we develop specialized
   taxonomies for organizing BIM domain knowledge, we will try to adopt the
   guidelines introduced by research. That is, the taxonomy is expected to
   be complex and complete; including classes that covering all the
   phenomena of our interest; based on decision-making rules, which are
   simple and stingy to assign instances to classes; and classes should be
   mutually exclusive. Moreover, because taxonomy is here as a tool for
   better understanding, these classes should be comprehensible and look
   natural.},

   Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector},

Abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable
   materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of
   carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural
   resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major
   contributor towards climate change and given that the construction
   industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial
   to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the
   context of developing countries. This research presents a novel
   framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information
   modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information
   systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize
   construction's design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and
   waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in
   Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and
   a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have
   been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of
   available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied
   emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to
   disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses.
   Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an
   optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization
   tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The
   case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the
   results show that 29.35\% of the materialization stage, 16.04\% of the
   operational stage, and 21.14\% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions
   can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental
   degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle
   might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective
   environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {For the last decade, the focus on sustainability has increased
   significantly. In the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction
   industry (AEC), the focus of sustainability is on making a Life Cycle
   Analysis (LCA) on the different building components. Research indicates
   that the collaboration between disciplines is limited because of human
   linguistic failure in BIM models. This research aims to bring forth the
   principles of mapping data with fuzzy logic algorithms and show the
   application in a practical collaborative context. With the application
   of Design Science Research methodology, this research will create an
   artifact in Dynamo for Revit, with the implementation of fuzzy logic
   algorithms for mapping LCA data from LCAbyg, is an LCA-program used in
   the danish AEC industry, and the linguistic data from a BIM model. The
   research shows that the implementation of a fuzzy logic system is an
   effective tool for mapping data. The result of the prototype concludes
   that fuzzy logic algorithms with ease can be used in a collaborative
   context. The study implies that the AEC industry's linguistic difference
   and purity are a limitation on using fuzzy logic algorithms. The
   research also indicates that the fuzzy logic algorithm used in parallel
   constellation may cause bad results, and the relegation or exclusion of
   different algorithms should be investigated. The research also shows
   that the linguistic deficiencies in LCAbyg concerning the applied
   linguistic of the industry have a significant implication on fuzzy
   logic.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Case Study of Carbon Emissions from a Building's Life Cycle
   Based on BIM and Ecotect (Retracted article. See art no 2193505, 2017)},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Using building information modeling (BIM) and Ecotect, this paper
   estimated carbon emissions during an office building's life cycle. This
   building's life cycle CO2 emissions were divided into three parts: the
   construction, operation, and demolition stages. Among these, the
   statistics on the schedule of quantities were generated using BIM, and
   the energy consumption during the building's operational stage was
   obtained using ECOTECT simulation. Sensitivity analysis was performed by
   changing several alternative parameters, to identify which parameter has
   more impacts on building performance. The paper demonstrated that (1)
   BIM and Ecotect are very helpful in estimating carbon emissions from a
   building's life cycle, (2) the primary and effective measures to reduce
   the building's CO2 emissions in hot and humid climate should be arranged
   as follows: (a) within the limits of comfort, reducing the fresh air
   volume; (b) extending the indoor temperature range; (c) improving the
   thermal insulation performance of exterior windows, walls, and roofs;
   (d) exploiting natural ventilation during transition seasons, and (3)
   currently there are some limitations in performing LCA based on BIM and
   Ecotect.},

Abstract = {The block type and structural systems in buildings affect the amount of
   building materials required as well as the CO2 emissions that occur
   throughout the building life cycle (LCCO2). The purpose of this study
   was to assess the life cycle CO2 emissions when an apartment housing
   with `flat-type' blocks (the reference case) was replaced with more
   sustainable `T-type' blocks with fewer CO2 emissions (the alternative
   case) maintaining the same total floor area. The quantity of building
   materials used and building energy simulations were analyzed for each
   block type using building information modeling techniques, and
   improvements in LCCO2 emission were calculated by considering
   high-strength concrete alternatives. By changing the bearing wall system
   of the `flat-type' block to the `column and beam' system of the `T-type'
   block, LCCO2 emissions of the alternative case were 4299 kg-CO2/m(2), of
   which 26\% was at the construction stage, 73\% was as the operational
   stage and 1\% was at the dismantling and disposal stage. These total
   LCCO2 emissions were 30\% less than the reference case.},

   Post-Pandemic Hospitals},

Abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has engendered extensive challenges for
   conventional hospital operations. To adapt to this problematic issue, a
   mixed-use hospital functioning system for normal and epidemic situations
   is proposed. However, the inherent complexity of a hospital embedded
   with a function of epidemic prevention and control renders a restrained
   construction process that may compromise quality. In this stance, we
   developed a BIM (building information modelling)-based simulation
   approach addressing life-cycle quality control in post-pandemic
   hospitals. An illustrative case study approach, which draws on the grey
   literature, was used to address the research question. BIM forward
   design was employed to integrate with such elements as functional
   streamline, emergency site, and ward conversion in the process of
   transformation from normal to epidemic-related operations. Computational
   fluid dynamics-based fluid simulation was conducted to obtain the most
   suitable air supply and exhaust solutions for negative pressure wards.
   BIM forward design method contributed to improving design efficiency and
   quality. The results of ventilation simulation and environmental
   analysis showed that the design scheme met all the functional
   requirements and technical specifications. Meanwhile, the best pipeline
   synthesis scheme was obtained, which reduced the rework and saved on
   construction time. The proposed method is beneficial to improve the
   efficiency of design information sharing and business collaboration.
   Implications generated from this study can be used as a significant
   reference for the future construction of various healthcare facilities.},

Title = {Waste capacity and its environmental impact of a residential district
   during its life cycle},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings generate a significant amount of waste that has considerable
   impacts on environment and energy flow. This study aims to investigate
   the waste capacity of the selected district and its effect on the
   environment within the current waste management policy via Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) methodology based on the two indicators; global warming
   potential and energy flow. The district has 82 buildings with 64,971m2
   total gross area and 2,000 populations. Accordingly, the district's
   waste capacity was evaluated within the classification of Municipal
   Solid Wastes (MSW), liquid wastes, and demolition wastes.
   The system boundaries of the LCA were set based on the gate-to-grave
   approach, which includes generated wastes during the lifespan of the
   buildings, including their end-of-life stage. Consequently, energy
   recovery potentials from waste processes were investigated and compared
   with the primary energy demand of the operational energy consumption of
   the buildings to perceive the amount of energy compensation range.
   Additionally, buildings' physical conditions, which obtained from their
   Building Information Models (BIM), energy performances, derived from
   their energy models and local specifications, obtained from standards
   were utilized to identify the current conditions and waste management
   systems. Critically, the outcomes of all those were used as input data
   for the LCA model.
   The results showed that there had been energy recovery potentials from
   MSW's treatments, while liquid wastes and demolishing wastes treatments
   have consumed energy. Energy recovery potential from MSW has compensated
   only 5.8\% of operational energy annually, which came from recycling
   processes. Also, all waste management systems release greenhouse gases
   to the atmosphere that cause global warming. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for the energetic consumption and potential
   greenhouse gas emissions during their life cycle. Water heating system
   contribute to a building's energetic consumption, mainly in residential
   units, throughout the building's operational phase. Variability in
   energy sources, reservation and distribution systems of hot water along
   with the types of construction materials used in these building systems
   are key decisions to make in the initial design phases of a building
   project. Often, the definition of the most appropriate water heating
   system for a building is made via a technical-economic decision.
   However, the decision is rarely based on natural resource consumption
   and environmental impact generation throughout the life-cycle of the
   heating systems and of buildings as a whole. This study presents an
   application of a specific environmental management tool, based on an
   integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life-Cycle Analysis
   (LCA) method for selection of hot water systems, during the early design
   building phase. The proposed approach is implemented in the
   pre-operational phase, in order to enable decision makers to appreciate
   the resulting environmental performance of water heating systems in
   buildings. The applicability of the framework is tested via a
   comparative study of solar heating water systems and natural gas heating
   water systems for a residential multifamily building to be constructed
   in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For the indicators damage to human health and
   damage to ecosystem, results indicate that the greatest impact on global
   warming comes from the natural gas heating system, while for solar
   heating, free particulate matter was the highest negative contribution.
   The operation phase for the natural gas system was highest for climate
   change while for solar heating system, it was the fresh water that was
   impacted the most during the pre-operational phase of the system's use.},

Title = {BIM as Infrastructure in a Finnish HVAC Actor Network: Enabling
   Adoption, Reuse, and Recombination over a Building Life Cycle and

Abstract = {This paper investigates how sociotechnical actions such as adoption,
   reuse, and recombination of designs and processes enable the users of
   building information modeling (BIM) tools to not only achieve
   productivity improvements in particular activities, but to build system
   capability that enables new ways of working. The evolution of BIM as
   digital infrastructure is studied in a network of companies developing
   and using BIM tools for new ways of working in the Finnish HVAC
   industry. The research methodology is a deductive case study testing a
   theoretical framework derived from the literature. The main finding is
   that BIM has emerged as digital infrastructure in design and
   construction, while development has stalled in use and operations. The
   explanation for the successful outcome in design and construction is
   found in the evidence of three sociotechnical actions of adoption,
   reuse, and recombination activating self-reinforcing positive
   developments in design and construction. The stalled development in use
   and operations is explained by a lack of adoption and reuse, which in
   turn inhibits the tool and process development required for increasing
   adoption. Servitization by extending project duration and aligning the
   business of actors to life cycle performance, standardization of
   interfaces and processes, and open architectures are identified as
   actions to activate digital infrastructure evolution for the later life
   cycle stages of a building. The originality and value of the paper is to
   demonstrate how the theoretical framework of sociotechnical action
   explains the emergence of BIM as digital infrastructure and how findings
   can be applied to identify specific management interventions to enable
   more successful outcomes. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {Application of life-cycle assessment to early stage building design for
   reduced embodied environmental impacts},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {81-92},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Decisions made during a building's early design stages critically
   determine its environmental impact. However, designers are faced with
   many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which
   decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result,
   designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process.
   Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage
   decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of
   building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents
   a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to
   inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of
   building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity
   analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building
   shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed
   that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements,
   and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness
   decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A
   multi-building residential development is used as a case study for
   introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that
   the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting
   those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant
   reductions in embodied carbon footprint. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {HBIM for storing life-cycle data regarding decay and damage in existing
   timber structures},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The conservation and maintenance of the historical heritage is an issue
   of great importance, especially when dealing with elements that can
   easily suffer damage along the time, either to intrinsic materials
   properties or by exposure conditions, like often happen for timber
   structures. For the management and maintenance of historic timber
   structures, HBIM (Historic Building Information Modeling) is here
   presented as a fundamental tool. This work presents the application of a
   methodology that uses common HBIM software in combination with results
   obtained from non-destructive testing and geometric surveying, allowing
   it to perform modeling, analysis and storage of geometric data, levels
   of decay and lack of material of timber structures within a
   tridimensional space. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates
   different time stages, thus allowing to make periodic comparisons along
   time, that substantiate a decision making process to take decisions
   about maintenance and intervention actions. In this work two case
   studies are used to validate this methodology and present its possible
   use. The case studies are: (i) the timber structure of the roof of the
   key tower of the Castle of Guimaraes, and (ii) the timber structure of
   the ceiling and roof of the room of the Knight's Room in the Convent of
   Christ, Tomar, both Portuguese buildings listed as UNESCO World Heritage
   Sites.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) continues gaining popularity in
   engineering construction as it helps lower the life cycle cost and
   ensure sustainability. The primary aim of this study was to delve into
   the effectiveness of BIM implementation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   (KSA) construction industry and understand the benefits, challenges, and
   risks associated with it. The present study has incorporated a
   qualitative and case study research design to investigate the
   effectiveness of BIM implementation. To this end, information was
   gathered through interviews involving BIM experts in the KSA, from which
   a thematic analysis was derived with the help of NVivo software. The
   results obtained highlight various benefits, challenges, and risks
   associated with the implementation of BIM tools, also covering the life
   cycle cost (LCC) and the procurement and type of contracts, initially
   referred to during the interviews, indicating that the importance of
   estimating the LCC in a project is crucial in the design phase, which
   also informs the decision making. In this case, 96.7\% of the
   participants agreed with this view. Moreover, two case studies were
   analysed to further demonstrate the effectiveness of BIM adoption. The
   outcomes of this study have the potential to add significant value to
   various aspects of engineering practice in the KSA.},

   in obtaining accurate shop drawings, cost estimation, and visualization.
   In this paper, BrIM is used as an integrated tool for bridges life cycle
   information modeling. In the design phase, BrIM model can be used in
   obtaining optimum construction methods and performing structural
   advanced analysis. During construction phase, the model selects the
   appropriate locations for mobile cranes, monitors the status of precast
   components, and controls documents. Whereas, it acts as a tool for
   bridge management system in operation and maintenance phase. The paper
   provides a detailed description for each use of BrIM model in design,
   construction, and operation and maintenance phases of bridges. It is
   proven that BrIM is an effective tool for bridge management systems
   throughout their life phases.},

Title = {Life cycle impact assessment of desktop stereolithography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {244},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies are nowadays employed in industry
   and prototype production in a range of different fields. A number of
   investigations have shown potential reductions of environmental impacts
   through the use of redesigned 3d printed products, although accurate
   information about the production phase is often missing. Despite the
   wide diffusion of stereolithography, reliable and updated data
   quantifying impacts of this technology are not available. In particular,
   this kind of information is lacking for desktop-scale stereolithography,
   whose market is increasing rapidly.
   This paper proposes a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of bottom-up
   desktop stereolithography. The analysed system includes the phases of
   material production, transportation, transformation and post-processing.
   The functional unit of the assessment regards one printed part. To
   efficiently quantify the actual impacts, the study introduces as
   parameters the mass of the product to be manufactured, the mass of its
   supporting structures and the building time. This parametrisation allows
   for an easy integration of the proposed investigation for an extended
   cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of the manufactured part. The
   life-cycle model was developed for a bottom-up desktop stereolithography
   apparatus located in Italy. Analyses and evaluations of the role of the
   different life-cycle phases in the environmental impact have been
   carried out in a specific case study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {This study investigates the application of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) to reduce life cycle costs (LCC) by addressing critical
   nonconformances encountered during the construction and operational
   phases of buildings. The primary aim is to identify nonconformances that
   escalate operational costs and to evaluate how BIM can effectively
   reduce these costs. The research begins with a comprehensive review of
   existing literature and utilizes the Delphi method to identify four key
   nonconformances that most significantly impact operational expenses. To
   further analyze these issues, semi-structured interviews and the
   Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are employed to
   determine the cost ranges of components associated with these
   nonconformances in both the construction and operational phases. The
   study finds that BIM-based optimization can lead to substantial cost
   reductions, although there are limitations due to the lack of precise
   data on the operational phase of low-cost equipment. The key
   contribution of this research is the development of a framework that
   helps designers create more effective BIM models, enhancing facilities
   management (FM) and reducing LCC. The originality of this study lies in
   its integrated approach, combining BIM and optimization techniques to
   directly address operational cost issues, which provides a novel
   perspective on improving life cycle cost management in buildings. Future
   research should expand the dataset and explore a broader range of
   nonconformances to refine and extend the framework's applicability.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between energy use,
   geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied
   worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle
   impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed
   and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to
   the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life
   cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy
   consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable
   variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations
   (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The
   variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with
   life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better
   understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of
   building energy consumption in the context of green building rating
   systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems
   approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market
   transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into
   consideration both energy sources and building efficiency.},

Abstract = {Although the construction industry has the potential to implement
   circular economy (CE) principles, the sector suffers from a veritable
   lack of initiatives to develop circular and regenerative design
   principles. However, existing buildings intended to be demolished could
   be considered as material banks for future constructions, with the aim
   to exploit anthropogenic resources, extend material/product efficiency,
   and reduce the extraction of natural resources. This concept of
   buildings as material banks is being studied more and more in the
   scientific literature, but it still requires the existing building stock
   to be fully digitalized, thus making materials reusable in new buildings
   starting from the architectural design stage. Moreover, the decision
   process regarding CE strategies requires the consideration of the
   environmental impacts of the deconstruction and end-of-life processes,
   which is essential in CE implementation. This paper introduces a digital
   platform for generating materials inventory and supporting the
   definition of reuse strategies. Then, by using digital tools in
   combination with life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of the
   deconstruction process and output of materials and components
   inventories, a method is defined and tested on a pilot building in
   Luxembourg.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a stochastic service life cycle analysis to gauge
   where a service is in its life cycle and to give forecasts about its
   future prospects. We employ customer review data to measure
   customer-oriented service maturity and use a hidden Markov model to
   estimate the probability of a service being at a certain stage of its
   life cycle. Based on this, we also develop three indicators to represent
   the future prospects of a service's life cycle progression. The main
   advantages of the proposed approach lie in its ability to model
   different shapes of life cycles without any supplementary information
   and to examine a wide range of services at acceptable levels of time and
   cost. We believe our method will assist firms in building
   stage-customised post-launch service strategies. A case study of mobile
   game services in the Apple App Store is presented.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the findings of research on the environmental
   performance of two case-study houses, a retrofit and new build. The
   retrofit was completed to a Passivhaus standard while the new build was
   completed to current Irish building regulations. Environmental
   performance of the retrofit and new build was measured using life-cycle
   assessments, examining the assembly, operational and end-of-life stage
   over life spans of 50 and 80 years. Using primary information,
   life-cycle assessment software and life-cycle assessment databases the
   environmental impacts of each stage were modelled. The operational stage
   of both case studies was found to be the source of the most significant
   environmental damage, followed by the assembly and the end-of-life stage
   respectively. The relative importance of the assembly and end-of-life
   stage decreased as the life span increased. It was found that the
   retrofit house studied outperformed the new build in the assembly and
   operational stage, whereas the new build performed better in the
   end-of-life stage; however, this is highly sensitive, depending on the
   standards to which both are completed. Operational energy savings pre-
   and post-retrofit were significant, indicating the future potential for
   adoption of high-quality retrofitting practices.},

Abstract = {The worldwide awareness of the impact of buildings and infrastructure on
   the environment has increased the need for construction industry's
   professionals to embrace sustainable practices. As a result, Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) as a comprehensive environmental assessment approach
   has been widely adopted to evaluate the environmental impacts of many
   building materials. However, in many countries, a local life cycle
   inventory (LCI) is not available to calculate LCA of construction
   materials, and utilizations of overseas LCI have become an effective way
   to create a localized inventory. This study aims to develop a framework
   which makes use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) models and
   non-local LCI database to compute carbon emissions generated from the
   production and transportation of local construction materials. Inputs,
   outputs and data conversion methods are analyzed in a detailed manner.
   The study contributes to a systematic data conversion method that can
   localize existing LCIs with high accuracy and efficiency.},

Abstract = {Prediction of construction cost and life-cycle cost through preliminary
   estimate is very important for the economic decision-making in the early
   phase of building projects. However, the conventional preliminary
   estimate has a high error range and low reliability because it relies
   only on the basic information of projects. In addition, the
   consideration of the life-cycle cost of the building is insufficient,
   causing problems such as budget shortage, inaccurate budgeting, and
   life-cycle cost increase. In this study, we propose a method of
   preliminary estimate based on BIM below the level of detail 2 and actual
   construction cost data to support the decision-making in the early
   design phase. To verify the proposed method, a web-based prototype was
   implemented and applied to three test cases. The range of error rate for
   three test cases was 1.93-7.16\% (average error rate: 5.18\%). It
   satisfies the criteria (-30\% \~{} +50\%) of the ``American Association
   of Cost Engineering{''}. As a result, the feasibility of the proposed
   model was validated. It is expected to be utilized as useful information
   in the decision-making occurring in the early design phase, and this
   allows for a rapid economic review of the design alternatives, a reduced
   LCC, and a shortened decision-making time.},

Title = {A Building Information Modeling-Based Life Cycle Assessment of the
   Embodied Carbon and Environmental Impacts of High-Rise Building
   Structures: A Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {High-rise buildings represent technological, urban, and life-style
   trends of the modern urban landscape, yet there are limited data
   regarding their embodied carbon and environmental impacts, particularly
   when compared to low- or mid-rise buildings. Given that the projected
   growth of the global urban population by 2050 requires cities with
   higher density and potentially a greater number of high-rise buildings,
   it is crucial to develop a clear understanding of the embodied carbon
   and environmental impacts of high-rise buildings. The primary structural
   materials used in high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and
   structural steel. As of today, over 99\% of tall buildings' structures
   are built from those two materials. This article utilizes a building
   information modeling (BIM)-based life cycle assessment (LCA) in Revit
   and Tally to examine the embodied carbon and environmental impacts of an
   actual high-rise building structure case study in Chicago that uses a
   hybrid concrete steel structure. The results show that the embodied
   carbon and environmental impacts of the high-rise building structure are
   dominated by the impacts of the product stage in the building's life
   cycle and by concrete being the main structural material. Specifically,
   this study reveals that concrete constitutes a substantial 91\% share of
   the total mass of the building structure, with a 74\% contribution to
   the life cycle global warming potential, 53\% to the acidification
   potential, 74\% to the eutrophication potential, 74\% to the smog
   formation potential, and 68\% to the non-renewable energy usage. On the
   other hand, steel accounts for 9\% of the building's structure mass,
   estimated to constitute 26\% of the global warming potential, 47\% of
   the acidification potential, 26\% of the eutrophication potential, 26\%
   of the smog formation potential, and 32\% of the non-renewable energy
   usage.},

   architectural Design Process of the building, among other Life Cycle
   Analysis (LCA) and digital analytical tools BIM (Building Information
   Modelling) defines the overriding requirements which the
   designer/architect should meet. The first part, the text characterized
   the architecture activity influences (by consumption, pollution, waste,
   etc.) and the use of building materials (embodied energy, embodied
   carbon, Global Warming Potential, etc.) within the meaning of the direct
   negative environmental impact. The second part, the paper presents the
   revision of the methods and analytical techniques prevent negative
   influences. Firstly, showing the study of the building by using the Life
   Cycle Analysis of the structure (e.g. materials) and functioning (e.g.
   energy consumptions) of the architectural object (stages: before use,
   use, after use). Secondly, the use of digital analytical tools for
   determining the benefits of running multi-faceted simulations in terms
   of environmental factors (exposure to light, shade, wind) directly
   affecting shaping the form of the building. The conclusion, author's
   research results highlight the fact that indicates the possibility of
   building design using the above-mentioned elements (LCA, BIM) causes
   correction, early designs decisions in the design process of
   architectural form, minimizing the impact on nature, environment. The
   work refers directly to the architectural-environmental dimensions,
   orienting the design process of buildings in respect of widely

Abstract = {Managing large international projects namely within traffic and
   transport structures design processes need a special attention in terms
   of dealing with enormous amount of data and information. Principally, to
   achieve economically sustainable life cycle of any traffic and transport
   structure, employing of Building Information Management (BIM) tools
   should be explored and evaluated from the global perspective. BIM itself
   contains huge potential, how to increase effectiveness of every project
   in its all life cycle. It means from initial investment plan through
   project and building-up activities to long-term usage and property
   maintenance and finally demolition. Both important economical sets of
   tools, and managerial or technological, must be considered. Managerial
   part aims to describe ways how to gather information of real
   expectations and desires of final users in terms of how could they
   benefit from managing long-term projects, covering whole life cycle in
   terms of sparing investment money and other resources. Technological
   part primarily describes new technologies that BIM may support and
   deliver to users anywhere in whole world. How to use this technology for
   data and metadata collection world wide, storage and sharing, which
   processes should these new technologies deploy. Specific emphasis and
   particular description of world usage in large international BIM

Abstract = {The major environmental and economic burdens occurring from the
   high-energy consumption of buildings led to energy performance being a
   critical aspect for green building rating systems. Building energy codes
   play an important role for such performances through establishing the
   baseline requirements to meet the rating system needs. Building
   information modeling (BIM) was used to model a concrete masonry unit
   (CMU) block wall with various insulation thicknesses assigned various
   insulation layer thicknesses depending on the insulation material
   property. Multiple scenarios were created in compliance with several
   energy codes and its different versions. The scenarios modeled were then
   analyzed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calibrate environmental
   performance of different energy codes used as baseline codes for
   different green building rating systems. The results indicate the
   differences between the various green building rating systems according
   to respective energy baseline codes and their versions adopted.
   Tendencies towards more efficient with less environmentally harmful
   buildings were observed. Comparing the different codes with the direct
   impact on the green building rating systems shows that rapid development
   in energy codes surpassed the impact resulted from adopting the green
   building rating systems. The amount of reduction in environmental impact
   was significantly and tangible due to change in the energy code. (C)

Abstract = {The essence of successful implementation of BIM in practice is knowledge
   about objects, their behaviour and other properties with higher overlap
   and throughout the life cycle of the building. In addition, other
   structurally and unstructured knowledge (historical experience, needs
   and requirements of users, investors, the need to perform revisions to
   some objects, etc.) is added to this. Taking all of these attributes
   into a building life-cycle management system requires the creation of
   both a knowledge management and knowledge management system and a time
   management system. Learning creates knowledge and ``knowledge
   organization{''} is an organization that uses knowledge to develop and
   achieve (long-term) goals. In general, there is no guaranteed procedure,
   no universal set of tools to help build a knowledge-based organization.
   If knowledge creation is to be used to better achieve results, it should
   not be separated from other activities of the organization. Knowledge
   Management represents the establishment and subsequent managing special
   network structure that includes all existing knowledge units. Knowledge
   management is often perceived as a survivor of the company today, but
   managers often do not realize that it is a much more complex process
   than generating large tables in Excel for comprehensive reporting to
   senior management and owners. Well-organized Knowledge Management can
   create concepts of knowledge, review and consolidate them, prepare
   action plans to create, secure, combine and coordinate knowledge, as
   well as set up clear ways to extract them from knowledge bases at the
   time of need and hunger for quality.},

Title = {BIM can help decarbonize the construction sector: Primary life cycle
   evidence from pavement management systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {391},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Transforming the construction sector is key to reaching net-zero, and
   many stakeholders expect its decarbon-ization through digitalization,
   but no quantified evidence has been brought to date. This article
   proposes the first environmental quantification of the impact of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction sector.
   Specifically, the direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road maintenance - a Pavement
   Management System (PMS) -are evaluated using field data from France. The
   related carbon footprints are calculated following a life cycle
   approach, using different sources of data - including ecoinvent v3.6 -
   and the IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three
   design-build-maintain pavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1
   relates to a massive design and surface maintenance, scenario 2 to a
   progressive design and pre-planned structural maintenance, and scenario
   3 to a progressive design and tailored structural maintenance supported
   by the PMS. First, results show the negligible direct emissions due to
   the PMS existence - 0.02\% of the life cycle emissions of scenario 3's
   pavement, e.g. 0.52 t CO2eq for 10 km and 30 years. Second, the base
   case and two complementary sensitivity analyses show that the use of a
   PMS is climate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade
   bearing capacity improves over time, neutral for the climate otherwise.
   The GHG emissions savings using BIM can reach up to 14 and 30\% of the
   life cycle emissions respectively compared to scenario 2 and 1, and
   resp. 47 and 65\% when restraining the scope to maintenance and
   rehabilitation and excluding original pavement construction. Third, the
   neutral effect of BIM in case of a dete-rioration of the bearing
   capacity of the subgrade may be explained by design practices and safety
   margins, that could in fact be enhanced using BIM. Fourth, the
   decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is discussed, and
   research perspectives are presented.},

Title = {Application Study on Building Information Model (BIM) Standardization of
   Chinese Engineering Breakdown Structure (EBS) Coding in Life Cycle
   Management Processes},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The successful adoption of building information modelling (BIM)
   technology has led to an ever-increasing need for improving management
   practices in both construction and operation stages of highway project
   engineering. The most significant aspect of applying BIM technology is
   establishing the rationality and concise engineering breakdown structure
   (EBS) coding. However, China has no uniform EBS coding standard for
   highways, which limits BIM technology development in different
   construction projects and at different stages of the same construction
   project. The purpose of this study is to propose an EBS standard that
   embodies a coding system for highways and at the same time meets the
   requirements of BIM management, project management (PM), and operation
   management (OM) in life cycle management process. This paper presents an
   EBS standard based on three classifications: (1) project-level
   construction, (2) project-level operation, and (3) network-level
   operation. A case study is given to illustrate the proposed EBS
   standard's coding system. The new EBS system will have better
   adaptability in both the design and construction stages. The proposed
   EBS coding system has been applied in many projects and is undergoing
   both improvement and standardization in China. The presented EBS coding
   standard provides successful implementation references for the future
   adoption and use of BIM on PM and OM in highway projects.},

Abstract = {The building industry is responsible for the highest resource use,
   amount of waste and emissions of all industries. The principles of the
   Circular Economy (CE) could offer an approach to create a more
   sustainable built environment. For a transition towards a circular built
   environment, a comprehensive assessment method is needed to support the
   development of circular building products. As a step towards such a
   method, we developed an economic assessment in the form of a Circular
   Economy Life Cycle Cost (CE-LCC) model. It is based on existing Life
   Cycle Cost techniques and adapted to meet the requirements of CE
   products. The model is developed to (1) consider products as a composite
   of components and parts with different and multiple use cycles, (2)
   include processes that take place after the end of use, (3) provide
   practical and usable information to all stakeholders, and (4) facilitate
   alignment of the functional unit and system boundaries with LCA. To test
   the model, it has been applied to the case of the Circular Kitchen
   (CIK). Three variants of the CIK were compared to each other and the
   `business-as-usual' case to determine which variant is the most
   economically competitive on the long term. The model indicates that the
   most flexible variant of the CIK has the lowest LCC outcome, even when
   considering multiple interest, lifespan and remanufacturing and
   recycling scenarios. Although, the model could benefit from further
   research and application, it can support the transition towards a more
   sustainable (building) industry.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a BIM-based Whole-life Performance
   Estimator (BWPE) for appraising the salvage performance of structural
   components of buildings right from the design stage. A review of the
   extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence
   salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their
   useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted
   to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of
   Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model
   was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and
   it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life
   salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated.
   The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable
   connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials
   that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective
   means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings
   are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will
   therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and
   designers to analyse the implication, of designs decision on the salvage
   performance of buildings over time. It will also be useful to the
   demolition engineers and consultants to generate pre-demolition audit
   when the building gets to end of its life.},

Title = {Mapping the scientific research of the life cycle assessment in the
   construction industry: A scientometric analysis},

Abstract = {The interest toward the life cycle assessment studies in the
   construction industry has been increasing in the last decades. However,
   there is no existing study that focuses on mapping the scientific
   research of the LCAs in the construction industry with a comprehensive
   understanding. Hence, an expansive and macro level study of the LCAs
   within the subject domain is necessary to fulfill this gap in the
   literature. The research objective of this study is to reveal the status
   quo, hot topics and keywords, and emerging areas of the LCA research in
   the construction industry. For this purpose, systematic bibliometric and
   scientometric analyses were conducted by referring 2885 bibliometric
   records published between 1997 and 2021 (end of February). The analyses
   indicated China, USA, and Spain as the most productive countries in the
   field. Additionally, hot keywords in the domain revealed as `energy',
   `environmental impact', `sustainability', `performance', `emission',
   `building', `system', `design', and `concrete'. `Circular economy',
   `mechanical property', and `footprint' are found as the emerging areas
   of this field. Document co-citation clusters showed the hot research
   themes of the domain as building information modeling (BIM), energy
   performance, construction and demolition waste, carbonation, water
   supply, bridge design, optimization, pavement management, ventilation,
   and design assessment. The results of this research make a significant
   contribution to the scientific community and industry practitioners by
   providing an inclusive understanding of the recent status, hot keywords
   and topics, and emerging areas of the life cycle assessment in the
   construction industry. Further, this study would be a useful and
   valuable reference and guideline for the researchers interested in this
   field.},

   Sustainability Assessment method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The built environment is significantly responsible for the current
   climate crisis, thus developing more sustainable projects is becoming an
   urgent objective. One widely recognized method that supports achieving
   this objective is the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), which
   enables a holistic, quantitative evaluation of building sustainability,
   including environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The
   integration of this method in digital design tools such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) facilitates its use during the building
   design stages. However, data granularity is not the same in every design
   stage, and consequently data consistency cannot be assured. Hence, the
   margin of unexpected variation of the results shall be avoided and
   robust results from the early design stages should be obtained. During
   the early stage, the level of details is generally limited to the
   element definition, while during the detailed stages, the volume of
   information regarding the building increased. This paper aims to fill in
   the informational gaps during the early design stage and align those
   results with a detailed data structure developed for cost estimation
   during the detailed stages. Thus, based on a case study analysis, we can
   demonstrate the consistency of the method by determining the variation
   of material quantities and comparing the LCSA inventory indicators
   during the early and detailed stages. This method can estimate more than
   60\% of the LCSA inventory indicators during the early design stage and
   the total results during detailed design stage.},

Abstract = {We present a building design optimization methodology that has been
   developed to address issues that researchers and engineers are currently
   facing when addressing the life cycle optimization of Nearly Zero Energy
   Buildings (NZEBs). In order to reduce the required computational time, a
   Kriging model is used to surrogate NZEB performance criteria during the
   optimization process. The error estimation of the Kriging model is used
   for an adaptive sequential design to improve the Kriging model accuracy.
   A genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is considered efficient to find the global
   optimal solutions. We also propose a new algorithm to reduce the
   calculation time even further. The new individuals of the adaptive
   sequential design are filtered with satisfaction functions. It means
   that only the useful part of the Pareto front will be determined.
   Finally, we use network visualization for decision-making. We show that
   this approach is very powerful to help designers find one solution in
   the context of multi-objective optimization. Moreover, the partitions
   can give useful information about the characteristics of the optimal
   solutions.},

Title = {Multi-information integration-based life cycle analysis of greenhouse
   gas emissions for prefabricated construction: A case study of Shenzhen},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global
   construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time,
   improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It
   is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However,
   there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced
   technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in
   prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi
   -information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG
   emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the
   production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The
   results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for
   the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77
   kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively,
   with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated
   components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest
   share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11\%, while the transportation
   and construction phases contribute 3.30\% and 0.59\% of the total
   emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of pre-fabricated
   construction can lead to a 31.62\% reduction in total GHG emissions per
   square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to
   traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study
   contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for
   calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of
   GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings.
   These findings can serve as practical references for future research to
   achieve the construction industry's green and low -carbon goals.},

Abstract = {Purpose The blockchain-based digital twin has been recognized as a
   prominent technological ecosystem featuring synergies with both
   established and emergent information management practice. The purpose of
   this research is to explore the applicability, interoperability and
   integrability of a blockchain-based digital twin for asset life cycle
   management and develop a model of framework which positions the digital
   twin within a broader context of current management practice and
   technological availability. Design/methodology/approach A systematic
   literature review was performed to map use cases of digital twin, IoT,
   blockchain and smart contract technologies. Surveys of industry
   professionals and analyses were conducted focussing on the mapped use
   cases' life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability and
   integrability with current asset life cycle management practice,
   exploring decision support capabilities and industry insights. Lastly, a
   model of framework was developed based on the use case, interoperability
   and integrability findings. Findings The results support approaching
   digitization initiatives with blockchain-based digital twins and the
   positioning of the concept as both a strategic tool and a
   multifunctional on-field support application. Integrability enablers
   include progression towards BIM level 3, decentralized program hubs,
   modular cross-technological platform interfaces, as well as mergeable
   and scalable blockchains. Practical implications Knowledge of use cases
   help highlight the functionality of an integrated technological
   ecosystem and its connection to comprehensive sets of asset life cycle
   management aspects. Exploring integrability enablers contribute to the
   development of management practice and solution development as user
   expectations and technological prerequisites are interlinked.
   Originality/value The research explores asset life cycle management use
   cases, interoperability and integrability enablers of blockchain-based
   digital twins and positions the technological ecosystem within current
   practice and technological availability.},

Abstract = {Despite the apparent simplicity of existing BIM-LCA tools, there is a
   lack of integration with the main BIM software, and the double-effort of
   design development and parallel simulations is a barrier to their
   implementation in the design process. Moreover, simplifications on these
   tools may provide misleading results to the designer. The main aim of
   this research is to develop an integration interface of
   manufacturer-based LCA data into a BIM platform by combining
   applications of existing and consolidated tools (namely, Autodesk Revit
   and Dynamo, and Microsoft Excel), in order to obtain environmental
   profiles for decision-making in the initial design stages, requiring
   less time, effort and ad hoc experts. The methodological procedures were
   aggregated into the following system development and testing phases: (a)
   input data organization, (b) creating new parameters on BIM software,
   (c) visual programming, (d) results analysis for decision-making and (e)
   simulation of social housing. The results of the developed tool provided
   complete results automatically, not requiring the designer to make
   changes in the software or interfaces. Some limitations were identified
   during development and application, due to the lack of LCA data
   availability by manufacturers, the complexity of data programming
   importation and extraction on BIM software for different construction
   subsystems, and the complexity of LCA results analysis and understanding
   encountered by non-experts. Regarding the latter, the research concluded
   that broad knowledge dissemination is still necessary to improve
   awareness regarding this environmental assessment methodology, in
   addition to determining the most advantageous environmental performance
   parameters, as a reference point for comparison.},

Abstract = {The concept of FM (Facility Management) is still in the initial stage in
   China and the current FM practices has been proved to have many
   shortcomings, including incomprehensive understanding of functions, less
   FM early intervention and etc. The core of these problems is the lack of
   a life-cycle information management from the FM point in building
   projects. The introduction of BIM may pave the way for the integration
   management of life-cycle information. Based on the theory of BIM and FM,
   this paper presented a FM mode of life-cycle information management
   based on BIM, and constructed the theoretical framework relatively. It
   provided a new way to further research on the combination BIM and FM.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of Embodied Carbon and Strategies for
   Decarbonization of a High-Rise Residential Building},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for the 40\% of consumed
   resources, 40\% of CO2 emissions, and approximately 40\% of construction
   and demolition waste. For the assessment of the building, there exists a
   standardized method, life cycle assessment (LCA), however, the process
   requires time, cost, and most importantly expertise. In this paper, a
   method is proposed and analyzed for the life cycle assessment of the
   building for the embodied carbon in the three stages, construction,
   operation, and demolition. Moreover, the result of the analysis is
   considered as the base result, and de-carbonization strategies
   identified through literature study for the three stages of
   construction, operation, and demolition are assessed with the same
   method to know how much each strategy will be effective in minimizing
   the embodied carbon. For the base case, a high-rise residential building
   in an urban region of India is analyzed, based on existing conditions
   through the building information modeling (BIM) method. The carbon
   emission of the selected building comes out to be 414 kg
   CO(2)e/m(2)/year, and assessing different decarbonization strategies,
   considering the first analysis as the baseline, it can be minimized to
   135 kg CO(2)e/m(2)/year.},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a quantitative tool used to evaluate the
   environmental impacts of products or processes. With respect to
   buildings, LCA can be used to evaluate the environmental impacts of an
   entire building's life cycle. Currently LCA in the building area is used
   in a limited capacity, primarily to select building products. In order
   to determine the causality for the lack of whole-building LCAs, focus
   groups with members of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   (AEC) communities were held. This article investigates the current level
   of knowledge of LCA in the AEC community and then discusses the benefits
   and barriers to the practice of LCA. In summary, the goal of the
   research was to identify why LCA is not used to its fullest potential in
   a whole-building LCA. In an open forum and moderated setting, focus
   group participants were asked individually to self-identify their
   experience with LCA, a brief education session on LCA was held, and then
   benefits and barriers to LCA were discussed. The focus group sessions
   were transcribed and systematically coded by social researchers in order
   to analyze the results. Hybrid flow and radar charts were developed.
   From the focus group results, the most important benefit to LCA was
   provides information about environmental impacts. The results did not
   identify a prominent barrier; however, building-related metrics were
   ascertained to be one of the more crucial barriers. The benefits and
   barriers classified by this analysis will be utilized to develop a
   subsequent online survey to further understand the LCA and AEC
   community.},

Abstract = {Building environmental design typically focuses on improvements to
   operational efficiencies such as building thermal performance and system
   efficiency. Often the impacts occuring across the other stages of a
   building's life are not considered or are seen as insignificant in
   comparison. However, previous research shows that embodied impacts can
   be just as important. There is limited consistent and comprehensive
   information available for building designers to make informed decisions
   in this area. Often the information that is available is from disparate
   sources, which makes comparison of alternative solutions unreliable. It
   is also important to ensure that strategies to reduce environmental
   impacts from one cycle stage do not come at the expense of an increase
   in overall life-cycle impacts. A consistent and comprehensive framework
   for assessing and specifying building assemblies for enhanced
   environmental outcomes does not currently exist. This article presents
   the initial findings of a project that aims to establish a database of
   life cycle energy requirements for a broad range of construction
   assemblies, based on a comprehensive assessment framework. Life cycle
   energy requirements have been calculated for eight residential
   construction assemblies integrating an innovative embodied energy
   assessment technique with thermal performance modelling and ranked
   according to their performance.},

Abstract = {Scientific community and practitioners of the Architecture, Engineering
   and Construction (AEC) sector have been developing life-cycle cost (LCC)
   concept for the past decades. However, information on a building's
   economic performance throughout its life-cycle is seldom readily
   available or accurate. This hinders the fulfilment of recommendations of
   international and regional standards, procurement guidelines and
   regulations, and for building management (BM) professionals to fully
   incorporate the LCC concept into their daily practice. This paper seeks
   to contribute to solving these difficulties by presenting a conceptual
   framework that enables LCC-informed decisions in BM, together with its
   empirical application to a portfolio of 158 public school buildings in
   Portugal (constructed area of 1,437,594 m(2)). It involved the
   gathering, organization and treatment of historical data of school
   buildings originally constructed from 1942 onwards. The historical
   analysis is presented in the form of three types of economic life-cycle
   key performance indicators (time series, indexes and relative ratios).
   It originated a database with more than 1.4 million results that offer a
   profound understanding of historical economic performance of this
   portfolio. The results can be adapted and used to benchmark or estimate
   construction, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement,
   rehabilitation, energy consumption, water consumption and deconstruction
   costs of buildings throughout the world.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for more than 40\% of global energy usage and
   as much as 33\% of global greenhouse gas emissions in both developed and
   developing countries. However, the study of carbon emissions over a
   building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling
   in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the
   results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to
   the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that
   Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying
   the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because
   they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools
   necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may
   alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA
   of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several
   parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on
   the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon
   emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the
   largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4\% of the
   total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction
   stage accounted for 12.6\% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately
   2\% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage.
   Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the
   building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these
   findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions
   in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings.
   However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should
   not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per
   year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use
   phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose Because the construction industry is one of the largest waste
   producers, understanding the primary reasons for waste production is
   essential. The goal of this study is to identify the major causes of
   waste production over the project life cycle in Iran's construction
   industry and to propose effective solutions based on modern technologies
   like BIM. Design/methodology/approach After identifying the primary
   causes of construction and demolition waste production through
   interviews and literature analysis, solutions based on building
   information modeling (BIM) were provided. Then, using questionnaires and
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the areas impacting waste reduction
   were found. Findings The findings suggest that ``prefabrication{''} is
   the best approach for improving time and quality, while ``detection and
   prediction of errors in the design and construction phases{''} is the
   most cost-effective technique for addressing cost and environmental
   issues. Originality/value Cost, time, quality and environmental concerns
   may all be influenced by effective waste management throughout the
   project life cycle. Furthermore, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies
   has far-reaching implications for reducing material waste, resulting in
   more environmental-friendly construction.},

Abstract = {Carbon emissions are an increasingly important consideration in
   sustainable environmental development. In the green building industry,
   green construction cost controls and low-carbon construction methods are
   considered to be the key barriers encountered. Based on Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) policy, management of carbon emissions from green
   building projects contributes to the acquisition of accurate building
   cost information and to a reduction in the environmental impact of these
   projects. This study focuses on the CO2 emission costs and low-carbon
   construction methods, and proposes a 0-1 mixed integer programming (0-1
   MIP) decision model for integrated green building projects, using an
   Activity-Based Cost (ABC) and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The
   major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) the integrated
   model can help construction company managers to more accurately
   understand how to allocate resources and funding for energy saving
   activities to each green building through appropriate cost drivers; (2)
   this model provides a pre-construction decision-making tool which will
   assist management in bidding on environmentally-friendly construction
   projects; and (3) this study contributes to the innovation operation
   research (OR) literature, especially in regard to incorporating the life
   cycle assessment measurement into construction cost management by
   utilizing a mixed decision model for green building projects. (C) 2014

Title = {Estimating city-level energy consumption of residential buildings: A
   life-cycle dynamic simulation model},

Abstract = {The residential building sector consumes a large amount of energy and is
   recognized as a high potential area where urban energy consumption and
   carbon emission can be reduced. To reduce the residential energy
   consumption, relevant policies and measures have been formulated in
   different places. However, due to the lack of adequate information in
   the process of policy formulation, the effectiveness of most
   energy-saving policies for residential buildings seems to be
   unsatisfactory. Although previous studies have analyzed the energy
   consumption for a single building or for the whole construction industry
   at the national level, few of them investigated the life-cycle energy
   consumption of residential buildings at the city level. Since municipal
   governments are the key implementers for the reduction of urban energy
   consumption, a city-level analysis on the energy consumption of
   residential buildings is highly needed for the policy making. To fill
   the research gap, this paper develops a life-cycle dynamic simulation
   model to fully reveal the characteristics of energy consumption of
   residential buildings at the city level. This easy-to-use model is
   validated by a case study of Beijing, which demonstrates its
   applicability and capability to help analyze multiple indicators of
   residential energy consumption and the dynamic trends of these
   indicators for municipal governments. Furthermore, the model can be used
   under the condition of limited input data, and can provide the situation
   analysis and simulation results of energy consumption of urban
   residential buildings for facilitating the policy making by municipal
   governments.},

Abstract = {Discussions on Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) have relied
   largely on partial or general equilibrium models. Such models are useful
   for integrating market effects into CLCA, but also have well-recognized
   limitations such as the poor granularity of the sectoral definition and
   the assumption of perfect oversight by all economic agents. Building on
   the Rectangular-Choice-of Technology (RCOT) model, this study proposes a
   new modeling approach for CLCA, the Technology Choice Model (TCM). In
   this approach, the RCOT model is adapted for its use in CLCA and
   extended to incorporate parameter uncertainties and suboptimal decisions
   due to market imperfections and information asymmetry in a stochastic
   setting. In a case study on rice production, we demonstrate that the
   proposed approach allows modeling of complex production technology mixes
   and their expected environmental outcomes under uncertainty, at a high
   level of detail. Incorporating the effect of production constraints,
   uncertainty, and suboptimal decisions by economic agents significantly
   affects technology mixes and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   of the system under study. The case study also shows the model's ability
   to determine both the average and marginal environmental impacts of a
   product in response to changes in the quantity of final demand.},

Abstract = {A holistic evaluation of a building's environmental impact must include
   a thorough accounting of both its operating and embodied energies,
   inclusive of the influence of hazard-induced damage and repairs.
   Unfortunately, these considerations are notoriously absent in today's
   practice owing to a traditionally segmented approach to the design
   process that has perpetuated interoperability challenges between
   existing commercial tools. In response to this and other limitations of
   existing approaches, this paper offers an integrated life-cycle
   assessment (iLCA) that (1) considers the effects of site-specific
   climate and exposure to wind and seismic hazards on a building's
   embodied and operating energy, (2) adopts an assembly-based approach to
   reveal the specific components influencing performance outcomes, (3)
   accommodates both risk-neutral and risk-adverse perspectives, and (4)
   addresses interoperability challenges that limit access to the data
   stored within commercial building information models. The resulting iLCA
   is partitioned into a sustainability workflow, with modules dedicated to
   embodied and operating energy, and a resilience workflow, sequencing
   modules for hazard characterization, structural response, damage, and
   repair/loss. A custom parser leverages semantic technologies to
   efficiently extract geometry and material information from the
   underlying data structures of Revit building information models; this
   parser ultimately supplies the required building data to each module. A
   unifying probabilistic framework is then adopted to quantify life-cycle
   performance, in terms of repair costs and total (embodied and operating)
   energy, with emphasis placed on expanding the statistical descriptions
   of performance to support both risk-neutral and risk-averse
   decision-making. The iLCA is applied to a case study office building at
   two sites to demonstrate the effects of climate and wind and seismic
   hazards on the performance of specific components over different service
   lives, inclusive of potential performance variability due to hazard
   exposure. The framework is further leveraged to examine how different
   sources of uncertainty, or assumptions surrounding the quantification of
   this uncertainty, impact life-cycle performance estimates. (C) 2020

Title = {Energy simulation and modeling for window system: A comparative study of
   life cycle assessment and life cycle costing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The impact of the window system on building thermal performance is
   considerably complicated. It depends upon several interactive design
   factors and climatic diversity. Unfortunately, there is a lack of
   comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) involving operational thermal
   efficiency with embodied production. Yet upgrading the thermal
   efficiency of windows and cost of energy savings should be justified
   from the additional investment cost. Therefore, the study presents a
   holistic approach for optimizing the windows system integrating
   operational efficiency with comprehensive LCA and life cycle costing
   (LCC). The study employed energy simulation software FirstRate5 over a
   range of energy-efficient windows to assess potential design variables
   for energy expenditure. Performed simulations illustrate the dominance
   of facade insulation (R) above glazing in reducing energy consumption,
   roughly 87\% of the cumulative reduction. However, the provision of a
   zero window is not an optimum solution for permitting daylight and fresh
   air. Thus, an analytical framework has been proposed for glazing to
   ensure thermal efficiency, lower embodied impacts, and
   cost-effectiveness. The resulting Pearson coefficient (r) shows a
   relatively higher thermal conductivity (Uw = 0.39) correlation with
   energy consumptions in a colder climate than hot- and warm-temperate
   environments. Thousands of simulations have been performed to generate
   data for developing linear regression models. In addition, Monte Carlo
   simulations have been conducted to validate the uncertainties of
   developed models. LCC analysis specifies the provision of glazing
   40-68\% of the window to wall ratio (WWR) feasible for optimal
   trade-offs. BIM-enabled LCA (Tally) identifies embodied environmental
   impacts for Aluminium, Timber, Fiberglass, uPVC, and Composite frame
   windows following the ISO 14040-14044 standards. Comparative analysis of
   different framed windows shows the suitability of using uPVC windows
   over others due to less cost, thermal efficiency, fewer environmental
   impacts, recycling possessions, and less energy demand at the
   manufacturing stage.},

Abstract = {With the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry
   representing a significant share of global energy consumption and
   greenhouse gas emissions, developing sustainable design and reducing
   buildings' environmental impacts has become a priority over the past
   decades. Adopting building information modeling tools and implementing
   them into life cycle analysis techniques at the early stages of design
   has been an effective method for buildings sustainability evaluation.
   With our environment constantly changing, it is reasonable that the
   construction industry should also aim to adapt to these changes and use
   them. However, the role of local climate features and their effects on a
   building's energy output is often neglected. By using building
   information modeling-life cycle analysis integration techniques, this
   research aims to consider the role of climatic attributes along with
   some passive design strategies in the life cycle assessment of the
   building and see how it affects that building's energy performance. By
   only applying passive design strategies (not including heating,
   ventilation, and air conditioning system type), the models' energy
   demand was reduced up to 30\% of the original value. It is also
   witnessed that by using the proper equipment and construction materials
   that match the respective climate, up to 28\% of the building's energy
   consumption during the operational phase, can be saved. Although
   insulation of the walls does reduce energy consumption values, it also
   contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in greenhouse
   gas emissions was estimated to be around 3\%, but since the insulation
   boards make up only 2\% of the building's area, it is a considerable
   amount.},

Abstract = {Residential buildings consume approximately 36\% of total electricity
   consumption in Cyprus and this is expected to continue increasing in the
   coming years. This study explores the potential for energy savings in
   residential buildings in Cyprus through optimising building envelopes
   and insulation materials. Using building information modelling and
   energy modelling software, the study analyses 120 combinations of
   building envelopes and eight insulation materials, identifying an
   optimal combination of wall, roof, and flooring materials that could
   result in 32\% energy load reductions and 27\% lower life-cycle costs
   compared to the median scenario. High-density rock wool insulation on
   roofs and double-glazed windows were also found to offer both monetary
   and energy performance benefits. A sensitivity analysis revealed that
   the current high energy prices could provide greater economic incentives
   to adopt these optimisation strategies. Optimising building materials in
   Cyprus could play a critical role in climate strategy while also
   offering significant economic benefits.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the environmental aspects and energy impacts of
   implementing a green roof system at the Hilton Watford hotel, utilizing
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) software (Revit) for 3D modeling and
   Insight for energy simulation. Following EN 15804:2012+A2:2019, the
   study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, focusing on
   embodied and operational carbon. Environmental Product Declarations
   (EPDs), Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) database, and the Royal
   Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) guideline inform embodied
   carbon calculations. Results show the green roof system releases
   263,839.56 kgCO(2)e as embodied carbon, while its sedum layer sequesters
   211,468.12 kgCO(2)e over a 50-year lifespan. Energy efficiency analysis
   indicates a 3.3 kWh/m(2)/yr reduction in energy consumption, leading to
   a 112,130.31 kgCO(2)e reduction in operational carbon emissions,
   highlighting the environmental benefits of green roof adoption. The
   findings suggest a 0.35\% mitigation of whole life cycle carbon
   emissions, with greater impact in situations of lower insulation
   effectiveness, showcasing the potential of green roofs in reducing
   carbon emissions. Additionally, the green roof incurs a minimal
   financial burden, constituting only 0.51\% of the overall project cost.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology of integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) to evaluate the
   economic implications of designing aging-in-place (AIP) homes at the
   conceptual stage. With the rising global aging population, there is a
   growing demand for housing tailored to elderly needs. This study
   emphasizes the importance of early design phases, offering a
   semi-automated model to estimate life cycle costs from design to
   disposal. The model enables comprehensive economic assessments,
   highlighting the long-term feasibility of design decisions by
   considering life cycle costs early in the process. Investing in
   accessible and universal design features upfront can lead to long-term
   savings by reducing the need for extensive future retrofits. The model
   allows for comparisons among different design alternatives, assessing
   the financial impact of features such as wider doorways, accessible
   bathrooms, and elevators. This study provides valuable insights for
   designers and homeowners, supporting efficient decision-making during
   the early design stages of AIP homes.},

Title = {Assessing Life Cycle Environmental and Economic Impacts of Building
   Construction Solutions with BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Worldwide authorities are increasingly concerned about construction's
   efficiency and sustainability, leading to the development of
   high-performance buildings. However, such facts have shifted a
   significant percentage of the building life cycle environmental impacts
   from the operation to the product and construction phases. Thus, the
   need to evaluate and select more sustainable materials and construction
   solutions arises, to also minimize impacts from these stages. To
   evaluate those impacts, LCA and LCC analysis are usually applied to
   assess the building impacts and costs, through the different life cycle
   stages. Despite the usefulness of LCA and LCC methods during the project
   phase, they are usually evaluated in the project later stages. It is too
   complex and time-consuming to gather and process all the required data
   during the project early stages. With the recent deployment of BIM, the
   opportunity to automate and shift LCA and LCC analysis to project early
   stages stands out. Facing the research gap, this study aims to develop a
   BIM-based decision-making tool for designers to evaluate the
   environmental, economic, and functional performance of different
   building construction solutions. To do so, 18 different simulation
   scenarios have been created in Autodesk Revit with different
   combinations of external walls, roofs, and floors. Then, a framework was
   developed in Dynamo to automatically characterize the building elements
   life cycle environmental impacts and costs, as well as to automate the
   LCA and LCC analysis during the project early stages. The outcomes can
   significantly reduce the required time, errors and efforts when
   performing LCA and LCC analysis, providing designers with real time
   decision support data and making an important contribution to the use of
   BIM for sustainability purposes.},

Title = {Life cycle sustainability tracker: a dynamic approach},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 31},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper bridges the gap between the theory and practice by
   developing a life cycle sustainability tracker (LCST). The study is
   seeking to proffer solutions to an observed shortcoming of conventional
   life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) communication platforms.
   Notably, the static nature of the information provided on such platforms
   has made it difficult for them to be used for real-time decision-making
   and predictions. The main aim of this paper is to develop a LCST that
   facilitates a dynamic visualisation of life cycle sustainability results
   and allows for an integrated benchmark across the dimensions of
   sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThe study leverages the model
   development capabilities of the design science research strategy in
   accomplishing a dynamic and novel communication platform. A life cycle
   thinking methodology and appropriate multicriteria decision approach
   (MCDA) is applied to accomplish a comprehensive, streamlined and
   replicable approach in mapping and tracking the progress of sustainable
   development goals (SDGs) in the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)
   projects in India.FindingsIt was found that: (1) The use of the LCST
   tracker provides a dynamic and holistic insight into the key LCSA
   indicators with clearly defined benchmarks to assess the impact on the
   SDG 11, (2) The NIP projects achieve an upward trend across all the
   regions, and the percentage of opportunities ranges from 11 to 24\%,
   with the South experiencing the highest growth and the North having the
   minimal increase in percentage and (3) The assessment score (52-58\%)
   provides performance metrics that align well with the LCST - which
   ranges between ``Fair{''} and ``Average{''} for all the regions in
   India.Originality/valueThe novelty of this research is that the LCST
   provides a transparent and harmonised approach to reporting on the LCSA
   results. The LCST utilises heat maps and radial mapping to achieve an
   intuitive display of large amounts of highly heterogeneous data, thus
   allowing the synthesis of large sets of information compactly and with
   coherence. Progress towards the SDGs change on a yearly basis; hence, a
   dynamic LCSA tool provides a timely and the valuable context to map and
   track performance across different regions and contexts.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (i.e., BIM) has been widely applied in
   civil engineering structures and infrastructures. Long-term performance
   of structures is of significance in whole life management, and BIM
   provides a useful tool to assess the durability of civil engineering
   structures at the design stage. Cracking is a significant durability
   problem in reinforced concrete structures as it destroys the integrity
   of the structures and causes premature failure. It is therefore
   desirable to predict the cracking of reinforced concrete structures and
   integrate the model in BIM platform so that better-informed decisions
   can be made for designers in terms of repairs and maintenance. In this
   paper, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) are combined to predict concrete cracking over time. The combined
   method is achieved in the BIM Application Programming Interface (API) to
   realise the whole life management. Moreover, maintenance strategies are
   developed which have an impact on structure bearing capacity and cost
   analysis. Meanwhile, optimised construction process decision could be
   made to allow designers and practising engineers to understand the
   serviceability and economic situation of the structures easily.},

Abstract = {Electrical instrumentation and control (EIC) systems can account for as
   much as 60\% of maintainable items as well as being critical to safe and
   efficient operations. Thus, it is imperative that as-built documentation
   is error-free and reflects precisely what has been installed. Yet EIC
   as-built drawings that are produced often contain errors and omissions.
   If EIC systems are ineffectively and inefficiently designed and
   documented, then asset owners' plant, equipment and facilities may fail
   to operate, which can result in considerable economic loss and
   jeopardize system safety. In order to improve the quality, efficiency
   and effectiveness of documentation production, it has been suggested
   that engineers should switch from using-computer-aided design (CAD) to
   an object-oriented model, which takes the form of a systems information
   model. Such a model provides the ability for electrical engineers to
   effectively integrate their work with a building information model. This
   paper builds upon the authors' previous research, which examined the
   need for a SIM by presenting and describing how an object-oriented model
   for EIC can be used through a project's life cycle. Examples are used to
   demonstrate the functionality-and robustness of the SIM. The adoption of
   a SIM will not Only lead to productivity throughout a project's life but
   also reduce the costs associated with managing and maintaining
   information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Life-cycle cost estimation of a building structure: An example of
   partition walls},

Abstract = {The growing pressure to optimise construction investment costs from the
   life-cycle perspective inevitably leads to efforts to seek new solutions
   that will facilitate informed decision-making in the early stages of the
   construction project. Awareness of the importance of considering future
   operation and demolition costs emphasises the shortcomings related to
   the possibility of making accurate predictions/estimations of such
   costs, which will become apparent in the future. To address this
   research gap, an innovative approach of life-cycle cost modelling on the
   level of individual structures of the building is presented. The model
   provides users with information on the costs of available technical
   solutions resulting from the requirements of the investor at a specific
   stage of the construction project. In this way, it helps investors
   optimise their building projects and to find the most economical
   solutions. Specifically, this model is assembled for the purpose of
   selecting a suitable partition wall and, therefore, it takes into
   consideration specific characteristics relating to this particular type
   of structure. The results indicate diversity in partition wall
   structural design variants at the early stage of the project. Since the
   ability to influence future costs decreases as the project progresses,
   the model allows capturing LCC perspective even if only a construction
   study is available without more detailed technical and economic
   information. The presented model aims to contribute to the higher
   performance of construction projects in the planning phase from the
   perspective of LCC and investors'/owners' point of view.},

Title = {Whole building life cycle assessment for buildings: A case study ON HOW
   to achieve the LEED credit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {297},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Whole building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has received significant
   attention from the research community in the past few years. The United
   States Green Building Council (USGBC) has made it an option for
   receiving points in version 4 of its Leadership in Energy and
   Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Yet, the research described
   in this paper has revealed that the process of WBLCA as applied to LEED
   is not very well understood by building professionals. As many building
   professionals do not understand WBLCA, very few pursue it for their new
   building projects. The objective of the research described in this paper
   was to examine and clarify issues related to WBLCA as it applies to
   LEED. The paper presents a six-step process for conducting a WBLCA and
   use the process on a building case study for which a LEED compliant
   WBLCA was conducted and approved. The paper also suggests improvements
   to the current LEED WBLCA requirements that have the potential to
   further reduce the embodied energy and environmental impacts of
   materials used in new building projects. The ultimate goal of the
   research presented in the paper is to increase the building industry
   awareness of the WBLCA process and make it ``business as usual{''}. (C)

Abstract = {Within this work, life cycle assessment modeling is used to determine
   top design priorities and quantitatively inform sustainable design
   decision-making for a prefabricated modular building. A case-study
   life-cycle assessment was performed for a 5,000 ft(2) prefabricated
   commercial building constructed in San Francisco, California, and
   scenario analysis was run examining the life cycle environmental impacts
   of various energy and material design substitutions, and a structural
   design change. Results show that even for a highly energy-efficient
   modular building, the top design priority is still minimizing
   operational energy impacts, since this strongly dominates the building
   life cycle's environmental impacts. However, as an energy-efficient
   building approaches net zero energy, manufacturing-phase impacts are
   dominant, and a new set of design priorities emerges. Transportation and
   end-of-life disposal impacts were of low to negligible importance in
   both cases.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a software tool for the predictive life-cycle
   management of reinforced concrete bridges. The novel aspect of this
   particular tool is the integration of non-destructive inspection
   techniques in combination with fully-probabilistic deterioration models.
   The use of these models requires that the building under examination be
   subdivided into multiple levels of detail. We employ a 3D model of the
   building for creating and visualizing the different system levels. At
   the same time the 3D model forms the basis of any data acquisition,
   analysis and evaluation. The system is implemented by coupling a Java 3D
   front-end with a relational database, in which the construction geometry
   and all related information is stored. Due to the long life span of
   bridge structures, the software is required to satisfy special
   requirements in terms of its flexibility. It is shown how new materials,
   inspection techniques, deterioration models, repair procedures etc. can
   easily be integrated into the software tool.},

Title = {Life-cycle assessment of non-domestic building stocks: A meta-analysis
   of current modelling methods},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building stock models (BSMs) are essential for simulating the
   contributions of regional and national building sectors to climate
   change under different policy scenarios, and for identifying pathways to
   climate change mitigation. To date, BSMs have focused on the operational
   life-cycle impacts of domestic dwellings; there has been less emphasis
   either on non-domestic buildings (NDBs) or full life-cycle analysis.
   This paper provides a first review of the theory and practice of NDB
   stock modelling which considers life-cycle energy, emissions and costs.
   A meta-analysis of the literature was undertaken involving a structured
   search of relevant articles in key scientific repositories. 98 in-scope
   studies were identified and data collected on their aims and objectives,
   methodologies, data sources, system boundaries, considered impacts,
   representativeness, uncertainty analysis, validation and verification
   techniques, further research identified, model transparency and software
   tools employed. The review necessitated the classification of modelling
   methodologies. The existing `bottom-up' and `top-down' groups were found
   to be ambiguous and led to confusion. Therefore, an alternative
   methodology classification is proposed, considering both the modelling
   technique and model simulation data used. The findings of the analysis
   indicate that most approaches use engineering models employing archetype
   data. However, almost all current life-cycle models of NDB stocks are
   incomplete. Only one study considered the full building life-cycle and
   most did not include uncertainty analysis. The reproducibility of study
   results is poor since most do not provide sufficiently-detailed
   information on the models and data used. Critically, there is a lack of
   representative input data which limits their usefulness as evidence in
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {Wood products are gaining interest in the building sector, due to their
   potential in sequestering greenhouse gas emissions. However, increasing
   wood materials use in the built market can have unforeseen changes in
   the material supply chains. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA)
   allows the assessment of changes in material supply chain. To quantify
   and link those consequences, the affected physical flows need to be
   estimated. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) can bring to CLCA modelling more
   representative and quantitative information than the commonly used
   hypothesis in consequential modelling. Indeed, MFA considers physical
   constraints (technology performances and material availability), in
   addition to account for mass balance. The main objective of this
   presentation is to illustrate how such consistency is added to CLCA
   through an MFA of wood products in non-residential (NR) buildings in the
   province of Quebec (Canada). Wood flows are tracked to identify their
   end-use markets and trends in consumption. To overcome the lack of data
   and bring insights on the sector's dynamics, such as stock variations
   and potential discarded flows that supply recycling markets, residence
   time model and also extrapolation and correlation between physical and
   economic parameters are used. Results show how flows can increase in the
   market before reaching their physical constraints, such as the available
   wood stock in the forest. These insights will significantly enhance the
   data collection for CLCA. In conclusion, the MFA brings support to CLCA
   by proposing a framework to model changes in the construction market.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon
   emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural
   design decisions play a critical role in a building's carbon footprint,
   making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various
   design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building
   information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon
   architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of
   a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach
   to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It
   combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and
   building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies
   present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first
   case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating
   carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon
   footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use
   of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest
   optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions
   made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the
   form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a
   comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in
   enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.},

Abstract = {Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) can be efficiently used to quantify
   wind-induced damage on a tall building. The LCCA selects an
   ``optimal{''} design solution by minimizing over structural lifetime the
   total cost (construction, maintenance and repair). Being based on the
   Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research equation, the LCCA relates the
   expected cost over the lifetime of the structure to the probability of
   exceeding specific damage levels. It also accounts for potential sources
   of uncertainty, such as variability in wind load intensity,
   directionality, structural properties, damage model estimation, etc.
   This paper proposes a LCCA methodology that evolves from the approach
   used in seismic engineering to numerically examine non-structural damage
   probability and predict maintenance costs on tall buildings by
   incorporating information on aerodynamic loads measured on a reduced
   scale model in wind tunnel. The final objective is to provide an
   efficient simulation procedure, which simultaneously accounts for
   stochastic characterization of wind load intensity and direction.},

Title = {Reducing construction waste in the construction life cycle of industrial
   projects during design phase by using system dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {There is tremendous growth in the construction of industrial projects in
   Egypt, resulting in a substantial quantity of construction waste during
   the industrial projects construction life cycle (CLC). This research
   assumes that managing the factors of construction waste will inevitably
   reduce its quantity during the CLC using building information modeling
   (BIM) and lean design. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impacts
   of two techniques (Designing Out Waste and Design Strategies) based on
   qualitative factors using the BIM/Lean design concepts in the design
   phase which could reduce construction waste in the CLC of industrial
   projects. To achieve this aim, the research presents a comprehensive
   analysis of the factors of construction waste using system dynamics. A
   model was proposed that serves as a decision-support tool to ensure
   construction waste reduction in the CLC. The model in this study
   includes eight causal loop diagrams giving the professionals better
   understanding for the objectives to reduce construction waste. This
   model has been processed using AnyLogic software with a stock-flow

   implementation are demonstrated using a case study for the suggested
   model. The case study's findings improved the model's confidence in
   order to utilize it for quantitative analysis. It has been further
   assessed for its impact in two proposed scenarios to reduce construction

Title = {Framework for construction system selection based on life cycle cost and
   sustainability assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {241},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a framework for the selection
   of construction systems of low and medium rise buildings used in
   residential, office and commercial applications. The construction
   systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural
   steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is
   developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle
   analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making
   in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from
   cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage,
   use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse
   options. The developed framework integrates building information
   modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to
   calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of
   construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to
   their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties
   in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability
   distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to
   investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result.
   Application of the developed system to a university building revealed
   the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for
   RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of
   SS framing system is 13.4\% more. When the system is credited for
   possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse,
   the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing
   system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS
   framing system becomes 22\% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results
   shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean
   cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The
   sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points
   associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste
   management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40\% of the final energy use and one third
   of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. At the city scale, a quantitative
   assessment of the environmental impact of buildings is essential to
   support sustainable energy policies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has
   been widely used to assess building related environmental impacts;
   however, its extension to the urban scale is still hampered by several
   operational challenges. Coupling LCA and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) has been identified as a promising solution but developments are
   still needed.
   This paper presents an automated approach for the energy modelling and
   LCA of urban housing stocks based on GIS. The main steps of the approach
   are the following: (i) GIS-based building stock characterization; (ii)
   automated building-by-building energy analysis; (iii) Environmental
   impact calculation via LCA. The approach was applied to the test case
   city Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) to assess the potential environmental
   impact reduction driven by housing retrofitting.
   Results were provided building-by-building and displayed as maps for
   improved communication. An energy savings potential of 35.3\% and a
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) reduction of 30.8\% were calculated as
   results of retrofitting. The average contribution of the retrofitting
   stage on the residual life of the building stock is 4 to 10\% of the
   GWP, depending on the building type.
   The study provided one of the first models able to perform a
   fully-fledged LCA of buildings at the urban scale in a bottom-up
   fashion. The results are meant to support local authorities in setting
   priority strategies for environmental impact reduction.},

Title = {Application of intuitionistic fuzzy set in social life cycle impact
   assessment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 23},
Abstract = {PurposeIntuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) has been found promising for
   handling ambiguity forms of uncertainty in social data. This paper
   undertakes an application of an intuitionistic fuzzy set in the social
   life cycle impact assessment (S-LCIA) of a public building project. This
   work proposes to combine an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) with
   multi-attribute decision-making in converting qualitative data into
   quantitative social impacts of the building project. This research
   utilises IFS to accommodate and handle experts' imprecise cognitions in
   S-LCIA to facilitate the identification and prioritisation of the most
   pressing indicators accompanying social impacts in a project.MethodsData
   were collected using questionnaire(s), structured interviews, and
   through targeted focus group sessions. Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)
   approach was used to model the obtained data from structured interviews.
   Using IFS, this research also accounts for missing or ambiguous data
   that emerged during the data elicitation process. In combining IFS with
   multi-attribute decision-making techniques, the social impacts of
   selected stakeholders were evaluated using fuzzy set and IFS approaches.
   Sensitivity analysis was then used to test the robustness of the results
   and ranking was conducted based on each social stakeholder
   subcategory.Results and discussionResults revealed that approximately
   23\% of missing datapoints in the public case study building were
   incorporated in the S-LCIA using IFS. The issues of highest priority in
   each of the considered subcategory in the public case study building
   project according to IFS are (i) consumer privacy by adopting more
   functional planning (0.27), (ii) public commitment to sustainability
   (0.33), and (iii) education provided in the local community by having an
   indigenous botanical element for children (0.39), respectively.
   Conversely, the FS technique inferred that the issue of highest priority
   in the consumer stakeholder is the feedback mechanism (0.26). The
   overall degree of correlation between the IFS and FS is only 0.234,
   revealing that IFS provides a different perspective from conventional FS
   when used in modelling social data.ConclusionThe IFS method provides an
   objective and systematic approach for dealing with a heterogeneous scope
   of imprecise and inexact social data in achieving holistic social life
   cycle assessment results. Furthermore, expansive stakeholder involvement
   would rely on a robust approach for improving social well-being in
   public buildings, thereby leaving no one behind in accomplishing a
   sustainable world.},

Title = {Optimization of Exterior Wall Cladding Materials for Residential

   Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Energy Consumption: A Case Study},

Abstract = {In today's construction industry, a topic of paramount importance is
   reducing energy consumption within buildings. This study endeavors to
   combine Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to enhance the
   environmental efficiency of buildings. The core objective is the
   optimization of materials used in the building's outer shell to
   effectively curtail operational energy consumption. To achieve this, we
   employed BIM modeling, parametric simulations with the Energy Plus
   engine, and Athena to assess the embodied energy in materials. The
   multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGAII was harnessed to determine
   the most suitable materials. The results derived from the LCA and BIM
   analyses illustrate that the selection of optimal materials for
   residential building facades in Iran can lead to a remarkable 40\%
   reduction in annual average energy consumption. Furthermore, this
   approach contributes significantly to mitigating global warming
   potential (GWP). Experts and architects can apply this method to
   evaluate and select the best materials for various building components,
   especially in high-rise buildings.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is well established in Denmark.
   However, there has been a lack of focus on the value that can be
   generated by using BIM during the design and construction phase. In this
   paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept
   look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work
   method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction
   processes? A literature review established the main areas to further
   address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project
   and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation
   of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic
   design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a
   digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases
   and into the construction and O\&M phases with the use of structured
   data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In
   order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital
   construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further
   developed. The work also discovers and investigates how an academic
   institution can develop work methods through on-going development, tests
   and evaluation in collaboration with practitioners from the AEC
   industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications.},

   solutions for office stock},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {61},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The European Green Deal establishes the need to renovate buildings in an
   energy efficient way, to address climate and environmental challenges.
   The purpose of this study was to devise a model for identifying
   environmental, cost-effective retrofitting measures by assessing their
   energy, economic and environmental impact when they are applied to the
   entire office stock. The methodology builds upon the energy performance
   certificate scheme to identify the life-cycle energy, economic and
   environmental impacts of a set of energy renovation measures for each
   representative office. The results can then be applied to the entire
   office stock. For any real office, a dozen characteristics are entered.
   Then, a user-friendly interface provides information about the expected
   performance of the renovation measures in that case along with the
   representativeness of the results. This methodology was implemented in a
   Spanish case study of 13,701 energy performance certificates. The
   findings showed that the most efficient energy renovation measures are
   heat pump replacement (18.1 \%) and replacement of lamps with LEDs (14.4
   \%). Although the most effective retrofitting solutions depended on the
   evaluation criteria (energy, economic or environmental), 99.5 \% of the
   cost-effective measures also reduced emissions during the life cycle.},

Title = {A spatio-temporal life cycle assessment framework for building
   renovation scenarios at the urban scale},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption of buildings is a priority for carbon
   emissions mitigation in urban areas. Building stock energy models have
   been developed to support decisions of public authorities in renovation
   strategies. However, the burdens of renovation interventions and their
   temporal distribution are mostly overlooked, leading to potential
   overestimation of environmental benefits. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   provides a holistic estimation of environmental impacts, but further
   developments are needed to correctly consider spatio-temporal aspects.
   We propose a spatio-temporal LCA framework to assess renovation
   scenarios of urban housing stocks, integrating: 1) a geospatial
   building-by-building stock model, 2) energy demand modelling, 3)
   product-based LCA, and 4) a scenario generator. Temporal aspects are
   considered both in the lifecycle inventory and the lifecycle impact
   assessment phases, by accounting for the evolution of the existing
   housing stock and applying time-adjusted carbon footprint calculation.
   We apply the framework for the carbon footprint assessment of housing
   renovation in Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg). Results show that the
   renovation stage represents 4\%-16\% of the carbon footprint in the
   residual service life of existing buildings, respectively after
   conventional or advanced renovations. Under current renovation rates,
   the carbon footprint reduction would be limited to 3-4\% by 2030.
   Pushing renovation rates to 3\%, enables carbon reductions up to 28\% by
   2030 when combined with advanced renovations. Carbon reductions in the
   operational stage of buildings are offset by 8-9\% due to the impacts of
   renovation. Using time-adjusted emissions results in higher weight for
   the renovation stage and slightly lower benefits for renovation.},

Title = {Developing a Methodology for Integration of Whole Life Costs into BIM
   Processes to Assist Design Decision Making},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {A common barrier to achieving design intent is the absence of
   comprehensive information about operational performance during design
   development. This results in uninformed decision-making which impacts on
   actual building performance, in particular Whole Life Costs (WLC). It is
   proposed that Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to
   facilitate a more comprehensive and accurate design approach from the
   initial stages if the model can utilize reliable and robust cost and
   performance data from buildings in use. This paper describes the initial
   findings of a research project that has investigated the integration of
   WLC estimation into BIM processes. The study focusses specifically on
   the rapidly emerging Private Rental Sector (PRS) as the build-to-rent
   market has repeatable tasks and similar workflow patterns, roles and
   responsibilities, but impacts of WLC can significantly influence the
   business model. The study adopted a mixed method approach for the
   development and validation of a structured standardized process for
   timely WLC estimation through BIM. The research identified a number of
   barriers. These included varying definitions of WLC calculation
   methodologies; the availability and standards of data sources, in
   particular, the misalignment of coding systems for identification and
   classification of components at various levels of development,
   proprietary ownership of data, lack of knowledge and skills in team
   members to produce and/or utilize data sources, and limitations of
   software. However, the research proposes that these may be addressed by
   a reverse-engineered systematic process that uses the Integrated
   DEFinition (IDEF) 3 structured diagramming modelling technique that can
   be incorporated into a software model and has developed a model for a
   systematic approach for BIM-enabled WLC assessment based on CE
   principles which would include access to live data streams from
   completed buildings. The paper describes this model development which
   has the potential to enhance BIM lifecycle management through an
   augmented decision-making approach that is integral to the natural
   design development process.},

Title = {Quantifying Australia's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for new
   homes},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {224},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Australia is going through a significant housing boom with approximately
   200,000 new homes built each year; and significantly more are required
   on an annual basis to accommodate the estimated population growth of
   almost 36 million by 2050. The effects of climate change are
   increasingly being felt and respon-sive action is required for
   mitigation and adaption, which must include the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emis-sion implications of this new residential stock. Mitigation
   strategies have been predominantly focused on decreasing the operational
   GHG emissions associated with buildings, leaving the other life cycle
   stages, such as construction, largely ignored. To achieve national
   targets, such as zero net emissions by 2050, it is imperative to address
   GHG emissions mitigation from a life cycle perspective. This study found
   that based on current building practices one new detached dwelling built
   today will be responsible for roughly 545 tCO(2)e by 2050. This
   translates to the need to plant over 8,000 trees to offset these
   emissions, a figure it is safe to say, most homeowners will not achieve.
   This study modelled life cycle GHG emissions of all new detached
   dwellings constructed in Australia for a single year (2019) estimating
   39 MtCO(2)e, which increases to 883 MtCO(2)e by 2030 and 3,654 MtCO(2)e
   by 2050. This is much higher than the current projections for
   Australia's total emissions by 2030 of 563 MtCO(2)e if a business as
   usual approach is fol-lowed, and the optimum target of 441 MtCO(2)e to
   meet emissions targets of 26\% less than 2005. The results of this study
   suggest that housing-related GHG emission are underestimated by 60\%,
   because of the absence of embodied GHG emissions being counted in
   emission projections. This emphasises that firstly, target and current
   GHG emission projections fail to consider emissions from a life cycle
   perspec-tive, and primarily report findings based on operational data,
   which as this study has shown can lead to a misrepresentation of almost
   96\% of total life cycle GHG emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle approach for addressing
   construction design choices: An applicative case study for a residential

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},

Abstract = {Energy demand reduction targets and sustainable design paradigms are
   fueling the search for more and more effective design solutions in the
   building sector, and new technologies and construction systems are being
   presented. However, each design solution has its own consequences for
   the environmental impact of the building. The use of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be
   profitably adopted for supporting the decision-making process. This
   paper reports a comparative methodology developed to analyse the impacts
   of alternative structural solutions for timber-based high-rise
   structures. Embodied, operational, and endof-life environmental impacts
   based on two structural frame types, a reinforced concrete (RC)
   structure and cross-laminated timber (CLT) are explored. Two main inputs
   are used for performing a comprehensive cradle-tograve LCA for the whole
   building: the bill of quantities from a Revit BIM model and the energy
   demand from DesignStudio. Then, an LCA is performed using the One Click
   LCA tool for a service life of 50 years and 12 impact categories. The
   environmental impacts of building materials are based on Environmental
   Product Declarations (EPDs) directly embedded in the tool. The method is
   then applied to a case study in Aalborg, Denmark. Results indicate that
   the total emissions for the considered case study are 9.6 kg- CO2
   eq./m2/y for the CLT structure against 10.8 kg- CO2 eq./m2/y for the RC
   structure. The production stage of building materials, including
   building systems and installations, accounts for around 55\% of the
   total emissions, while energy use (B6 phase) during the in-use stage of
   the building recorded a lower environmental impact (45\%). The outcomes
   confirm the opportunity to base the discussion on alternative design
   options on more objective and data-based elements to support the
   different positions which already involve a wide range of architectural,
   functional and financial criteria. This is of great relevance in
   achieving balanced and informed decisions which do not simply follow
   green-labelled ideas but are grounded on evidence-based considerations.},

Title = {Comparative life cycle assessment of light frame timber and reinforced
   concrete masonry structural systems for single-family houses in
   Luxembourg},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {The building sector's significant greenhouse gas emissions and energy
   consumption present added challenges to meeting European climate
   commitments amidst rapid population growth. In Luxembourg, single-family
   houses dominate the residential buildings, noticeably contributing to
   construction waste and CO2 emissions. This study compares the
   environmental impacts of a threestory reinforced concrete masonry
   single-family house and an identical timber building in Luxembourg,
   emphasizing greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy. A cradle -to
   -grave life cycle assessment was conducted using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) models to analyze the global warming potential and
   primary energy requirements. Environmental product declarations from the
   producers and the center dot OKOBAUDAT German database were used to
   determine the environmental impacts of the materials. The results show
   that the timber building outperforms the concrete building with a 43.5\%
   lower global warming potential, while the concrete building demonstrates
   a 15.6\% reduction in primary energy demand. This aligns with the
   average outcomes of seven similar studies discussed in this paper, at
   33.2\% and 4.7\%, respectively. Moreover, the timber building is 78.6\%
   lighter than the concrete one. When evaluating benefits and loads beyond
   the system boundary, the timber building provides 3.6 and 4 times
   greater advantages in terms of global warming potential and primary
   energy, respectively, compared to the reinforced concrete masonry
   building. Additionally, the study explores the impact of reusing the
   floors in the timber building. The cradle -to -grave LCA reveals that
   reusing the timber slabs improves the building's global warming
   potential and primary energy by 2.4\% and 1.2\%, respectively. However,
   when considering the benefits and loads beyond the system boundary,
   floor system reuse exhibits a 38.9\% surge in global warming advantages
   while reducing primary energy benefits by 28.1\%. The findings advocate
   for a policy promoting timber construction and reuse in Luxembourg,
   aiming to achieve the net -zero emission target by 2050.},

Abstract = {Purpose Sustainable building design suffers from a lack of reliable life
   cycle data. The purpose of this paper is to compare life cycle costs of
   sustainable building projects, examine the magnitude of various cost
   drivers and discuss the implications of an emerging shift in cost
   drivers. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on data from 21
   office buildings certified in Denmark according to the sustainable
   certification scheme DGNB. Findings The paper supports previous findings
   that construction costs and running costs each roughly make up half of
   the life cycle costs over a 50-year period. More surprising is the
   finding that the life cycle costs for cleaning are approximately twice
   as high as the supply costs for energy and water.
   Originality/value This paper provides a notable contribution to the
   academic understanding of the significance of different cost drivers as
   well as the practical implementation of life cycle costing.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the U.S., about 50\% of total CO2 emissions stem from
   the built environment (e.g., building construction, operation {[}
   heating, lighting, cooling], and end-of-life) (EPA 2012). Improving the
   performance and efficiency of the built environment offers the largest
   and least cost GHG mitigation option of any sector of the global economy
   (IPCC 2007). Science-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are
   increasingly being used to analyse the environmental impact of
   construction materials and products.
   Objectives: This paper presents a framework for LCA-based environmental
   decision making for commercial buildings at the conceptual design phase,
   compares it to the currently available LCA tools and data bases, and
   identifies the ``next steps{''} in developing a comprehensive LCA
   standard for assessing whole building life cycles to support
   environmental decision making in design and construction.
   Methodology/approach: 1) CSU/AIA conducted focus groups in 8 US cities
   to explore actual and potential use of LCA in decision making by
   architects; 2) A framework created based on feedback from focus groups,
   3) The framework was compared to existing LCA tools and databases, 4)
   Gaps were identified for next stages in developing an LCA-based
   environmental decision-making tool for conceptual design.
   Findings and contributions: 1) Current LCA tools are balkanized and
   usually address only one life cycle stage, material or system in a
   building. 2) LCA-related databases normally only address materials and
   product; they do not address construction activities or building
   operations. 3) LCA tools and databases generally require a completely
   separate activity, data input and expertise; they are not integrated
   into routinely used architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   tools, methods or best practices. 4) LCA based decision-making will not
   become an AEC best practice until it is fully integrated, comprehensive,
   standardized, affordable, and demanded by customers and municipalities.

Abstract = {This study presents a method which allows conducting an energy and
   emission related Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and cost-related Life Cycle
   Cost Assessment (LCC) of large residential building stocks focusing on
   selected heating system components. Using this method the status quo as
   well as two refurbishment scenarios for an entire neighbourhood with 196
   residential buildings in Munich, Germany, is assessed. Within the status
   quo and the refurbishment scenarios, among other things, the use of
   different energy systems and energy standards of the building envelope
   are investigated. CityGML semantic 3D city models serve as a source of
   building-specific information for these assessments. The results show
   that even if all residential buildings are refurbished to passive house
   standard and powered by renewable energies by 2035, life cycle-based
   energy demands and emissions will still be present, that counteract the
   goal of achieving climate neutrality. In addition, the life cycle-based
   costs exceed the savings achieved by the refurbishment. The developed
   method is implemented in Java which provides on the one hand a new
   approach to assessing building stocks on a life cycle basis and on the
   other hand its transferability. This results in innovative evaluation
   and assessment possibilities for political and municipal
   decision-makers.},

Abstract = {One of the most important target controls in engineering management is
   construction safety. Because there are annual reports of construction
   safety accidents in China, traditional safety management should look for
   breakthroughs. Although many scholars use various methods to improve
   building safety, they lack the consideration of building life cycle
   safety planning. Therefore, this paper proposes a life cycle safety
   management platform based on BIM-4D. The issues with traditional safety
   management are first examined. Then, in order to address these issues,
   this paper proposes the use of BIM-4D technology to improve project
   safety management and exhibits the benefits of this technology in this
   regard. Following that, a BIM-4D-based life cycle safety management
   platform is built, followed by a life cycle application process scheme
   for the management platform, so that all project participants may
   understand their duties in safety management. The results show that this
   paper provides a reference for the deepening application of life cycle
   safety management of construction projects.},

Abstract = {gbXML is an open schema that supports data inter-operability between BIM
   applications and different building design software tools (gbXML, 2018).
   Its capability to bring in geometric and construction information can
   help reduce the time and uncertainty of the energy modeling process (Ham
   and GolparvarFard, 2015). However, during the design cycle, when both
   geometric and system data are updated continuously, the lack of methods
   to quickly insert system information in the BIM-exported gbXML has a
   significant impact on the modeling efficiency as well as the model
   integrity. This project aims to develop an open-source gbXML to
   EnergyPlus translator, the gbEplus, which provides flexibility for
   user-defined system modules plug-in. It adopts the OpenStudio reverse
   translator to ensure a quality geometry and construction data
   conversion. A plug-in interface is designed as the gateway for importing
   data from external resources to gbXML-EnergyPlus translation process in
   the run-time, and all the previously developed system modules can be
   stored in a userdefined library for reuse in the future. The gbEplus was
   developed and validated with models from Phase II gbXML geometry
   benchmark test documents. Two applications, for parametric design and
   model calibration, were developed to demonstrate the adaptability of
   this new BIM-BEM tool.},

Title = {Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Light Steel Framed Buildings with
   Cement-Based Walls and Floors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to apply the life cycle assessment
   methodology to assess the environmental impacts of light steel framed
   buildings fabricated from cold formed steel (CFS) sections. The
   assessment covers all phases over the life span of the building from
   material production, construction, use, and the end of building life, in
   addition to loads and benefits from reuse/recycling after building
   disposal. The life cycle inventory and environmental impact indicators
   are estimated using the Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings. The input
   data related to the building materials used are extracted from a
   building information model of the building while the operating energy in
   the use phase is calculated using an energy simulation software. The
   Athena Impact Estimator calculates the following mid-point environmental
   measures: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, human
   health potential, ozone depletion potential, smog potential,
   eutrophication potential, primary and non-renewable energy (PE)
   consumption, and fossil fuel consumption. The LCA assessment was applied
   to a case study of a university building. Results of the case study
   related to GWP and PE were as follows. The building foundations were
   responsible for 29\% of the embodied GWP and 20\% of the embodied PE,
   while the CFS skeleton was responsible for 30\% of the embodied GWP and
   49\% of the embodied PE. The production stage was responsible for 90\%
   of the embodied GWP and embodied PE. When benefits associated with
   recycling/reuse were included in the analysis according to Module D of
   EN 15978, the embodied GWP was reduced by 15.4\% while the embodied PE
   was reduced by 6.22\%. Compared with conventional construction systems,
   the CFS framing systems had much lower embodied GWP and PE.},

Title = {Assessing Factors Affecting Fall Accidents among Hispanic Construction
   Workers: Integrating Safety Insights into BIM for Enhanced Life Cycle
   Management},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Falls are the most common type of accident in the construction industry,
   and falls to a lower level are among the leading causes of fatalities.
   Work-related fatalities due to falls, slips, and trips have been
   increasing, with Hispanic workers among the highest fatalities. This
   study investigated the association between fall accidents and attributes
   such as age, musculoskeletal pain (MSPs), sleep hours, safety knowledge,
   use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and working hours among
   Hispanic construction workers involved in building construction. This
   study collected 220 valid responses and used nonparametric chi-square
   tests and binary logistic regression to analyze the data. This study
   found that the location of the fall, MSPs, and use of personal
   protective equipment have a significant effect on the likelihood of
   having fall accidents. The strongest predictor of fall accidents was
   ``fall from a ladder{''}, followed by having two or three MSPs. The use
   of PPE had the highest decreasing ratio in odds of fall accidents,
   indicating the importance of wearing PPE properly. The results show the
   importance of integrating safety management strategies within
   construction projects' broader life cycle management. The insights list
   how project engineers can incorporate these findings into Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) systems to enhance project planning and
   safety measures in reducing fall-related accidents and their severe
   consequences. This study highlights the importance of addressing MSPs,
   properly using PPE, and reducing falls from ladders in the construction
   industry to prevent fall accidents among Hispanic workers and minimize
   their severe consequences.},

Abstract = {The building sector represents one of the major sources of environmental
   impact due especially to space and domestic hot water heating and
   construction works. A number of studies focused so far on estimating the
   energy savings and carbon emissions reduction potential achievable by
   retrofitting urban building stocks, nevertheless a shift to life cycle
   assessment is needed to properly assess the environmental impacts in a
   more holistic way.
   The aim of this study is to develop a geospatial data model for the life
   cycle assessment of environmental impacts of building stocks at the
   urban scale. The methodology includes: geospatial processing of
   building-related data to characterize urban building stocks; a
   spatio-temporal database to store and manage data; life cycle assessment
   to estimate potential environmental impacts.
   The methodology was tested for a case study in Luxembourg and
   preliminary results regarding the retrofitting stage of residential
   buildings were provided for one entire city. The data model is part of a
   wider bottom-up framework being developed to support decision about
   building stock retrofitting for sustainable urban planning.},

Title = {Structural Optimization of Trusses in Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) Projects Using Visual Programming, Evolutionary Algorithms, and
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tools},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The optimal structural design is imperative in order to minimize
   material consumption and reduce the environmental impacts of
   construction. Given the complexity in the formulation of structural
   design problems, the process of optimization is commonly performed using
   artificial intelligence (AI) global optimization, such as the genetic
   algorithm (GA). However, the integration of AI-based optimization,
   together with visual programming (VP), in building information modeling
   (BIM) projects warrants further investigation. This study proposes a
   workflow by combining structure analysis, VP, BIM, and GA to optimize
   trusses. The methodology encompasses several steps, including the
   following: (i) generation of parametric trusses in Dynamo VP; (ii)
   performing finite element modeling (FEM) using Robot Structural Analysis
   (RSA); (iii) retrieving and evaluating the FEM results interchangeably
   between Dynamo and RSA; (iv) finding the best solution using GA; and (v)
   importing the optimized model into Revit, enabling the user to perform
   simulations and engineering analysis, such as life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and quantity surveying. This methodology provides a new
   interoperable framework with minimal interference with existing
   supply-chain processes, and it will be flexible to technology literacy
   and allow architectural, engineering and construction (AEC)
   professionals to employ VP, global optimization, and FEM in BIM-based
   projects by leveraging open-sourced software and tools, together with
   commonly used design software. The feasibility of the proposed workflow
   was tested on benchmark problems and compared with the open literature.
   The outcomes of this study offer insight into the opportunities and
   limitations of combining VP, GA, FEA, and BIM for structural
   optimization applications, particularly to enhance structural efficiency
   and sustainability in construction. Despite the success of this study in
   developing a workable, user-friendly, and interoperable framework for
   the utilization of VP, GA, FEM, and BIM for structural optimization, the
   results obtained could be improved by (i) increasing the callback
   function speed between Dynamo and RSA through specialized application
   programming interface (API); and (ii) fine-tuning the GA parameters or
   utilizing other advanced global optimization and supervised learning
   techniques for the optimization.},

Abstract = {In the recent years the issue of BIM is gaining increased attention and
   there is a growing number of practical applications of BIM. The basis of
   BIM is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), 2013, published as
   International Standard ISO 16739: 2013. IFC constitute an open data
   format for data exchange between different types of software
   applications, used in design, construction and subsequent management of
   buildings (Facility Management), i.e. throughout their entire
   life-cycle. Authors created within the international project SE-Lab an
   application for data conversion to structural analysis (Structural
   Analysis View MVD). The structural data are converted from IFC standard
   to ATENA software input format, which is suitable for the nonlinear FEM
   analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures. The
   functionality of ATENA solution core has been extended in order to solve
   some of previously unsupported load types which are part of the IFC
   standards. Integration of the NLFEA with stochastic and degradation
   modeling allows to assess life-cycle reliability of civil engineering
   structures or structural elements.},

Abstract = {Daylight analysis and optimization are pre-requisites for
   energy-efficient and sustainable infrastructure. Conventional practices
   of designing and providing artificial lighting often ignore the
   consideration of the availability of natural daylight for the
   infrastructure. This paper aims to analyze the availability and
   potential of natural daylight reviewing the sky component type at a
   designated location, real-time sensor-based illuminance measurement
   on-site and BIM-based daylight simulation. Consequently, a sensor
   prototype was deployed to the metro rail station for automated
   optimization. Firstly, the sky component type of Ahmedabad was
   determined based on the literature review. Subsequently, sensors were
   integrated at the strategic grid point location covering the entire
   metro rail station to collect real-time Illuminance for daylight factor
   calculation. Furthermore, BIM-based sun path and shadow analysis and
   daylight simulation were carried out to suggest the possibility and
   potential of daylight savings. Finally, based on all the analysis and
   results, a newly designed sensor-based prototype was developed and
   equipped to enhance automated optimization for daylight savings, which
   resulted in 29\% energy savings monthly. This approach significantly
   helps the project stakeholders to enhance building energy performance
   and lead a step closer towards sustainable infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Growing environmental awareness in society increasingly influences
   individual everyday decisions, such as which product to buy or how to
   sustainably use it. Yet, available information to support these
   decisions is often limited, or difficult to understand particularly
   regarding sustainability. Effective ways of communicating environmental
   impacts of individual decisions are required to close this gap. While
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an established tool to evaluate
   environmental impacts of products and services and support environmental
   decision-making, the results are typically standardized and based on
   statistical or averaged data. However, for individuals, this information
   might be irrelevant, as it neglects personal situation, behavior,
   information need, or individual level of expertise. In tackling those
   central issues of personalization in LCA, this article focuses on two
   main questions: How can individual aspects be addressed in LCA and at
   which stages of the methodology can LCA be personalized? For this
   purpose, the ISO 14040/44 standards are analyzed regarding
   individuality, and current approaches in literature are presented. In an
   explorative approach, this research identifies two general approaches of
   personalizing LCA. A personalized Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) enables
   evaluating the environmental impacts of personal(ized) products and
   conditions. A broader personalization approach based on the flexibility
   of the methodological framework of LCA aims at providing understandable
   and relevant results for individual stakeholders. This article provides
   an overview, outlines key aspects of this vision, and points out further
   research needs to bring the concept into application.},

Abstract = {The implications of optimised structural designs in the life cycle
   carbon performance of buildings have been systematically overlooked in
   previous studies. The paper addresses this common limitation offering an
   integrated sustainable structural analysis at building level. To achieve
   this, a BIM-embedded approach was established utilising embodied carbon
   metrics and results from heuristic structural optimisation. A real
   building scenario was used to test the proposed approach in the context
   of multi-storey reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Results show how the
   building life cycle performance is affected by the use of structurally
   optimised designs. The structural floors in particular, not only cover
   the largest proportion of the embodied carbon in the structure but they
   are also responsible for a large proportion of the carbon emissions of
   the tested building elements. The results obtained in this paper
   justified the need for more comprehensive efforts in the design
   optimisation of RC floors. Overall, it is suggested that the unclear
   interpretation of the optimisation outputs would result in the selection
   of structural designs that could compromise the buildings carbon
   performance. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become a widely accepted method for
   environmental assessment of buildings, but is still not commonly applied
   in design practice. The biggest potential for optimization and reduction
   of GHG emissions lies in the early stages of the design process.
   Therefore, a design-integrated approach for LCA is needed. The goal of
   this paper is to describe the development of a parametric LCA tool for
   application in early design stages in the Swiss context. The envisioned
   users of the tool are primarily architecture and engineering students,
   but also practitioners. The integration of LCA throughout the design
   process is solved through a modular strategy. In the early stage,
   pre-defined components are selected to model a complete LCA. In the
   following design steps when more information is available, individual
   materials can be input with higher level of detail. The Bombyx tool is
   developed as a plugin for Grasshopper based on Rhinoceros3D and includes
   an SQL material and component database. Users are able to choose
   different materials and building systems and quickly modify the
   building's geometry while continuously receiving the calculated
   environmental impact in real-time. Visualization of the results, e.g.
   colour code indicate how the design performs in relation to a benchmark
   or optimization potential. The project is developed in open source to
   broaden the user and developer community and foster new ideas, designs
   and implementations in Bombyx.},

Abstract = {Data exchange and data sharing is still one of the big challenges in the
   AEC industry. BIM and open standards like IFC, SAREF or CityGML and
   lately the use of Semantic Web technologies provide a sound basis to
   implement exchange requirements derived from typical AEC use cases.
   Meanwhile many solutions are available that may already solve the
   problem in question. However, it is very challenging to find out what is
   available and how to align it with specific requirements.},

Title = {Uncertainty in the life cycle assessment of building emissions: A
   comparative case study of stochastic approaches},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment of buildings has become popular recently, due to
   the significant potential of emission reduction. Previous studies have
   contributed much to the quantification of emissions, yet the issue of
   uncertainties needs to be further investigated. In general, the
   uncertainty in life cycle assessment is mainly due to the errors in
   input parameters, definition of system boundary and scenario
   assumptions, and choice of analytical models, which could be summarized
   as parameter, scenario, and model uncertainties. In the present study,
   data quality indicators were adopted and a semi-quantitative method was
   modeled accordingly, relevant to the uncertainty analysis of building
   emission assessment. A case study building was analyzed comparing the
   deterministic and stochastic approaches, and the results indicate that
   the uncertainty in input parameters could result in a standard deviation
   of 3106 tCO(2e) for the sample mean of 61504 tCO(2e), which is in line
   with the deterministic results. Further scenario analyses investigated
   the influence of scenario and modelling alternatives. Relevant results
   emphasized the definition of system boundary and energy efficiency to
   control uncertainties, and suggested applying statistical distribution
   for key parameters in analysis. Overall, the present study could provide
   useful information on the uncertainty of life cycle emission assessment,
   and, therefore, be helpful in decision-making regarding the low-carbon
   development of building industry.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment evaluation of green product labeling systems for

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool that can be utilized to
   holistically evaluate novel trends in the construction industry and the
   associated environmental impacts. Green labels are awarded by several
   organizations based on single or multiple attributes. The use of
   multi-criteria labels is a good start to the labeling process as opposed
   to single criteria labels that ignore a majority of impacts from
   products. Life cycle thinking, in theory, has the potential to improve
   the environmental impacts of labeling systems. However, LCA databases
   currently are lacking in detailed information about products or
   sometimes provide conflicting information.
   This study compares generic and green-labeled carpets, paints, and
   linoleum flooring using the Building for Environmental and Economic
   Sustainability (BEES) LCA database. The results from these comparisons
   are not intuitive and are contradictory in several impact categories
   with respect to the greenness of the product. Other data sources such as
   environmental product declarations and ecoinvent are also compared with
   the BEES data to compare the results and display the disparity in the
   databases.
   This study shows that partial LCAs focused on the production and
   transportation phase help in identifying improvements in the product
   itself and improving the manufacturing process but the results are
   uncertain and dependent upon the source or database. Inconsistencies in
   the data and missing categories add to the ambiguity in LCA results.
   While life cycle thinking in concept can improve the green labeling
   systems available, LCA data is lacking. Therefore, LCA data and tools
   need to improve to support and enable market trends.},

Abstract = {The building sector contributes to 50.9 percent of China's carbon
   emissions. Due to the complexity of the assessment process, it is
   difficult to predict the entire life cycle carbon emissions of a
   building at the early stage of design. In this study, a whole-life
   carbon emission estimation model for the early stage of building design
   is developed based on comparison of the standard calculations and an
   analysis of stock cases. Firstly, the standard calculation methods in
   China, Japan and Europe were compared, and the boundary of the model was
   defined in three parts: production, construction and demolition and
   operation. Second, information on 68 examples of Chinese buildings was
   collected and divided into a training set and a test set at a ratio of
   7:3. In the training set, the relationship between carbon emissions and
   the design parameters was searched, and a carbon emission estimation
   model applicable to different stages was constructed. Finally, the model
   was applied to the test set for validation. The results show that the
   calculation error of the model is within +/- 15\%, and it can quickly
   estimate carbon emissions based on the design factors, which is helpful
   for carbon emission assessment work in the early stages of design.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Harvested rainwater is an alternative water source for buildings,
   especially for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing.
   While rainwater harvesting is perceived as a sustainable design
   approach, there is limited information on the environmental and economic
   performance of this technology. To address this literature gap, life
   cycle assessment and life cycle costing tools were applied for a
   dormitory that could potentially use harvested rainwater to flush
   toilets or to irrigate the lawn. Five scenarios were modeled including a
   new versus renovated building and irrigation versus toilet flushing
   water end use. The rainwater cisterns for all the scenarios were sized
   using the Yield After Spillage approach and long term daily
   precipitation of Toledo. Energy and greenhouse gas emissions were
   calculated using Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (for
   construction phase and energy use by pump) and GaBi (for water and
   wastewater treatment) databases. The life cycle environmental impacts
   and costs were estimated and compared to the business as usual scenario,
   where the water supply demands are met by municipally supplied potable
   water in a combined or separate sanitary sewer network. It was
   discovered that energy and greenhouse gas emission payback periods can
   be achieved for almost every scenario. Yet cost payback periods of
   implementing harvested rainwater were found to be longer than the life
   time of the building except for two scenarios: using rainwater for
   irrigation in a renovation project and using rainwater for toilet
   flushing in a new construction project. These two scenarios had the
   lowest cost, energy and greenhouse gas emission impacts among all
   scenarios modeled. Reducing occupancy to match toilet flushing demand
   increased the per person impact. However, in general, the per person
   impacts were much lower than a person's impact from driving or
   electricity use. While separate sewers divert the stormwater runoff to
   the water bodies and thereby prevent the environmental problems
   resulting from combined sewer overflows, a rainwater harvesting system
   connected to separate sewers was found to reduce the energy and
   greenhouse gas emissions less than so if the rainwater harvesting system
   were connected to combined sewers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Combining life cycle assessment and Building Information Modelling to
   account for carbon emission of building demolition waste: A case study},

Abstract = {Building demolition waste presents a significant challenge due to its
   large scale. Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition,
   collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has
   environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed
   by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
   appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However,
   previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon
   emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the
   treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A
   conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the
   assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building
   demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information
   Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into
   the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential
   building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented
   in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from
   recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to
   another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental
   benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could
   contribute to as high as 45\% of carbon emission reduction despite only
   accounting for 0.66\% of the total weight. Across various lifecycle
   stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to
   the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better
   performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of
   carbon emissions. Furthermore, a large scale inventories are developed
   as an outcome of this case study. These findings provide useful inputs
   to the future endeavor of building demolition waste recycling in a bid
   to reduce the associated carbon emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A data-driven life-cycle optimisation approach for building
   retrofitting: A comprehensive assessment on economy, energy and
   environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A novel data-driven life-cycle optimisation approach is proposed for
   building retrofitting. The innovation points include big-data
   information, integrated retrofitting design, and life-cycle optimisation
   through a comprehensive assessment of the economy, energy and
   environment. The optimal retrofitting plan is selected to maximise its
   life-time cost-saving, energy reduction and carbon reduction. The
   proposed retrofitting optimisation approach is tested on a real-world
   building. The standard retrofitting options include roof insulation,
   wall insulation, wind turbine, solar heater, biomass boiler, combined
   heat and power system and photovoltaic panel. The historical energy
   consumption, building information, historical weather data, and
   inventory data is adopted in the data driven model to replicate the
   real-world case. Although building retrofitting would increase economic,
   energy and environmental effects at the beginning of its life-cycle due
   to increased investment cost, embodied energy and carbon of retrofitting
   materials, the overall life-cycle cost, energy and carbon would be lower
   than those non retrofitted buildings. It is found that envelope
   insulation has the lowest unit return cost, energy and carbon, followed
   by the solar heater, combined heat and power system, biomass boiler,
   wind turbine and photovoltaic panel. Through the optimal retrofitting
   plan, 39\% life-time cost-saving, 55\% life-time energy reduction and
   59\% life-time carbon reduction can be achieved at an investment cost of
   1.32 pound x 10(6).},

Abstract = {Data centres are high-energy consumers, and historical assessment of
   their environmental impact has focused largely on energy consumption.
   Widely adopted assessment methods consider either single issues or do
   not comprehensively assess links between issues. One exception is the
   CLEER Model, which compares life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of Cloud-based and present-day services. However, there
   remains the need to verify components for inclusion in a data centre
   life cycle assessment (LCA), assess quality and quantity of secondary
   data, benchmark an existing data centre LCA, assess non-Cloud-based
   services for multiple impacts, and establish facility areas that are
   sensitive to change.
   A hybrid approach, combining process-based and economic input output
   (EIO) data, was used to perform the screening LCA of an existing UK data
   centre. The study includes the definition of the goal and scope,
   modelling assumptions, a life cycle inventory, results and
   interpretation and a sensitivity check.
   The dominance of the information technology (IT) operational phase to
   the overall impact and the severity of the impact on human health are
   concluded. Due to the use of free cooling, the IT-embodied impact is
   greater than the combined mechanical and electrical operational impact.
   Electricity production dominates the total life cycle impact; however,
   the second most significant impact derives from the disposal of metal
   refining waste products during the manufacture of IT components and
   electricity distribution networks. The release of carcinogens is one of
   the largest contributors to the whole life cycle impact and is almost
   equal in value between the embodied and operational phases. Finally, a
   sensitivity check found that a Swedish facility optimised for
   operational energy efficiency with a 1.25-year server refresh resulted
   in an embodied impact almost double the operational.
   It was concluded that current LCI data, software packages and project
   data allow for a sufficiently accurate data centre LCA model. The
   results support the need to broaden environmental impact reduction to
   beyond operational energy consumption for cooling and that building
   environmental assessment methods (BEAMs) should consider more embodied
   impacts. It is concluded also that three parameters are sensitive to
   design changes that influence the overall impact: operational energy for
   the IT equipment, cooling and power delivery; the energy mix; and the
   amount of IT equipment across the facility's lifetime. The results
   present a clear need to monitor life cycle impact, develop further tools
   to compare different design/operation options and functional units,
   improve data and develop an LCA-based BEAM.},

Abstract = {The HOLISTEEC project aims at designing, developing, and demonstrating a
   BIM-based, on-the-cloud, collaborative building design software
   platform, featuring advanced design support for multicriteria building
   optimization. In the framework of HOLISTEEC project, the first step
   towards the optimization of the overall building design process is put
   forward in this paper and corresponds to the definition of a ``full
   life-cycle aware{''} novel design methodology. This methodology, after
   being properly validated, will constitute the basis for the
   implementation of a BIM infrastructure suitable for the development of
   dedicated design evaluation tools (i.e. architectural, structural,
   acoustic, energy, lighting and environmental calculation engines),
   providing grounded feedback to the design and a multi-criteria decision
   tool for selecting the optimal design solution.},

Title = {Designing hybrid life cycle assessment models based on uncertainty and
   complexity},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the wide use of LCA for environmental profiling, the
   approach for determining the system boundary within LCA models continues
   to be subjective and lacking in mathematical rigor. As a result, life
   cycle models are often developed in an ad hoc manner, and are difficult
   to compare. Significant environmental impacts may be inadvertently left
   out. Overcoming this shortcoming can help elicit greater confidence in
   life cycle models and their use for decision making. Methods This paper
   describes a framework for hybrid life cycle model generation by
   selecting activities based on their importance, parametric uncertainty,
   and contribution to network complexity. The importance of activities is
   determined by structural path analysis-which then guides the
   construction of life cycle models based on uncertainty and complexity
   indicators. Information about uncertainty is from the available life
   cycle inventory; complexity is quantified by cost or granularity. The
   life cycle model is developed in a hierarchical manner by adding the
   most important activities until error requirements are satisfied or
   network complexity exceeds user-specified constraints. Results and
   Discussion The framework is applied to an illustrative example for
   building a hybrid LCA model. Since this is a constructed example, the
   results can be compared with the actual impact, to validate the
   approach. This application demonstrates how the algorithm sequentially
   develops a life cycle model of acceptable uncertainty and network
   complexity. Challenges in applying this framework to practical problems
   are discussed. Conclusion The presented algorithm designs system
   boundaries between scales of hybrid LCA models, includes or omits
   activities from the system based on path analysis of environmental
   impact contribution at upstream network nodes, and provides model
   quality indicators that permit comparison between different LCA models.},

   Sustainability Assessment},

Abstract = {The Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology offers a
   promising solution to achieve a sustainable built environment by
   simultaneously considering all sustainability pillars. However,
   traditional LCSA applications are typically confined to the early design
   stages of building projects, where they assess the entire life cycle of
   a building using static historical data rather than being employed as a
   decision-making tool throughout all project phases with real-time data
   integration. This research addresses these limitations by investigating
   the integration of LCSA with Digital Twin (DT) and Blockchain
   technologies to enhance sustainability assessments in building projects.
   The primary aim is to develop a dynamic framework that incorporates
   realtime data across a building's entire life cycle. This study utilizes
   a systematic literature review to identify current trends and gaps,
   leading to the development of an integrative framework validated through
   a case study of a typical residential building. The findings demonstrate
   that integrating DT facilitates continuous monitoring and assessment of
   environmental, economic, and social impacts, while Blockchain ensures
   data security, integrity, and transparency. This novel approach supports
   real-time, iterative LCSA applications, enhancing decision-making from
   design through construction and maintenance. By showcasing a practical
   application of DT and Blockchain in real-world scenarios, this framework
   significantly advances sustainable practices in construction. The
   originality of this research lies in its holistic approach, combining DT
   and Blockchain to deliver a more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive
   sustainability assessment model, setting a new standard for future
   developments in the field.},

Title = {Climate-neutral municipal building stock-life cycle assessment of large
   residential building stocks based on semantic 3D city models},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {This publication presents the results of applying Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) methods to the entire residential building stock of Germany's
   third largest city, the City of Munich. The focus of the LCA is on the
   technical components of the building heating system. For the analysis,
   we use our developed tool urbi+, which takes 3D city models in the
   CityGML standard enriched with building specific information as input
   parameters. Thus, we investigate both the status quo of Munichs'
   building stock and two different development scenarios with the goal of
   climate neutrality by the year 2035. Development scenario 1 focuses on
   the use of heat pumps and scenario 2 on the expansion of the district
   heating network. The year 2035 has been defined by the City of Munich as
   the official goal for achieving climate neutrality. Within the scope of
   the assessment, we address the parameters of energy demand, greenhouse
   gas emissions and costs. The results show a multidimensional assessment
   space between these parameters and how ambitious it is to achieve the
   goal of climate neutrality by 2035. The results are intended to help
   political and urban planning decision-makers validate climate targets
   and make informed decisions about measures to achieve climate
   neutrality.},

Title = {Life cycle inventory regionalization and uncertainty characterization: A
   multilevel modeling approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases are essential to evaluate the
   environmental burden of a product or service using life cycle assessment
   (LCA). The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results
   has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and
   quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is
   proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and
   uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to
   retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between
   the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and
   material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather
   than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The
   uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction
   interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer
   application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states
   from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed
   approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods.
   For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively,
   around 60\% and 80\% of variations within the datasets are explained by
   MLM, and 86.1\% and 96.8\% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the
   MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3\% and 70.5\% when
   traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95\% prediction
   intervals cover more than 95\% of measurement data in both input cases.
   It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for
   future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical
   information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. (c) 2019

Abstract = {Social dimensions, as one of the three pillars of sustainability, are
   commonly not fully considered in the planning, bidding, and design
   processes of construction projects, primarily due to a lack of
   standardized estimation methods. Despite the potential economic and
   social benefits of these projects, they may lead to various negative
   social impacts during the construction process. In this study, negative
   social impacts associated with construction projects are investigated
   considering different stakeholder categories and detailed social cost
   models. The social impacts and costs estimated in this paper cover a
   multitude of adverse effects on: (a) workplace and traffic safety, (b)
   mobility of people and goods, (c) regional economic growth, (d) dwelling
   environments, and (e) public services. Parameters for the social cost
   estimation are obtained based mainly on various public databases and
   project information. For illustration, the proposed framework is applied
   to quantify the social impacts associated with the construction of a
   residential building and the maintenance of a highway bridge. The study
   shows that the social costs of different construction projects vary
   significantly due to the different stakeholders involved. The
   compositions of diverse social cost components to the total social
   impact are investigated for these two construction projects.},

Title = {Biodiversity impact assessment of building's roofs based on Life Cycle
   Assessment methods},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {158},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To fight against the biodiversity loss and to take advantage of
   ecosystem services that nature can offer, urban planners integrate green
   spaces in urban projects. However to assess green spaces, attention is
   generally paid to local biodiversity (i.e. ``in situ{''}) which concerns
   the plot on which buildings are constructed. The biodiversity impacted
   outside the construction site (i.e. ``ex situ{''}) which concerns the
   extraction of materials, transportation and waste, is rarely associated
   to the project assessment.
   In this study, two endpoint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are
   applied: ReCiPe 2016 and Impact World + to assess a conventional roof
   and three different types of green roofs. As Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)
   data about urban plants are missing, we created new data to model the
   vegetation layer of green roofs by collecting information nearby plants
   nursery.
   This work shows that 1) extensive green roof generates the least
   biodiversity loss, 2) ``ex situ{''} biodiversity is 10 times more
   impacted than ``in situ{''} biodiversity, 3) the impact of the
   vegetation layer on the biodiversity loss is significant.
   LCA methods do not enable to cover all pressures threatening
   biodiversity and they also lack precision to assess ``in situ{''}
   biodiversity. Nevertheless, their main strength is to consider ``ex
   situ{''} biodiversity along the value chain of the studied systems.
   Coupling LCA with ecological expertise should improve the assessment by
   taking into account local specificities and both negative and positive
   impacts of a system (e.g. ``in situ{''} biodiversity gains with green
   roofs).},

Title = {Measuring the environmental impact of IT/IS solutions - A life cycle
   impact modelling approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {94-104},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The academic community has already taken notice of the interactions
   between information technologies (IT), information systems (IS),
   business organizations and the environment. Despite the interest
   garnered, research and modelling approaches on the environmental impact
   of IT/IS are usually explored only through qualitative approaches. This
   paper introduces a way for researchers and practitioners to engage with
   the environmental impact of IT/IS in a more quantitative manner using
   flow based life cycle assessments (LCA). Distinct from other life cycle
   assessment studies, this research paper confirms that integration of
   information flows within life cycle inventory analysis can be both
   useful and viable. Our work presents a conceptual framework for
   flow-based LCA within the context of IT/IS consisting of possibilities
   for defining functional units, a meta model for building symbiotic
   inventory models, the use of established software tools and databases as
   well as concrete actions to apply our framework within simulation
   studies. We hope that better knowledge of the environmental impact of
   IT/IS solutions will facilitate an effort for more sustainable
   solutions. The framework was derived by literature review, design
   science research and evaluated via a simulation. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {A multi-regional based hybrid method for assessing life cycle energy use
   of buildings: A case study},

Abstract = {Although sustainable development in the construction industry has
   attracted much attention, relevant studies on the regional scale
   analysis of industrial energy performance are still rare in China,
   especially for Guangdong province, which is currently on the frontier
   and fast track of national low-carbon development. In response, this
   study integrates a multi-regional input-output method with field based
   operational data to quantify the total embodied energy consumption and
   energy transfers from the construction industry and assess the life
   cycle energy use of residential and office buildings in Guangdong
   Province. The results show that the embodied energy consumption of the
   provincial construction industry is localization dominant and fossil
   fuel oriented, which accounts for approximately 18.6\% of the total
   regional energy consumption. The geographical connection and resource
   characteristic are the two factors that influence the interregional
   energy transmissions induced by construction activities in Guangdong
   province. The result of uncertainty analysis indicates that the mean
   value of energy intensities simulated by Monte Carlo simulation is
   highly consistent with the deterministic results. It is crucial to
   improve the accuracy of the input-output analysis by providing
   sufficient economic information. At last, a number of recommendations
   are given through the technology, product, and management aspects at the
   industrial and building levels. The local government and construction
   department can benefit from implementing such environment-friendly,
   technology innovative and multi-disciplinary solutions in the
   full-process management and improvement of energy reduction of
   buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Toward a national life cycle assessment tool: Generative design for
   early decision support},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The life cycle assessment (LCA) has proven to be a reliable methodology
   for achieving sustainable development. The number of studies and
   attempts of integration at the building design stage is increasing. This
   study is aimed at developing a framework for a national LCA tool that
   considers Egyptian constraints and strikes a balance between embodied
   and operational impacts to serve as a decision-support tool for early
   design. This is achieved by first reviewing and analyzing LCA
   integration methods during the early design stages, emphasizing
   parametric methods. Second, studying the situation of LCA and energy
   efficiency in Egypt through publications, building codes, and
   residential building construction specifications. As a result of these
   steps, a suggested implementation method based on the generative design
   was developed as a tool framework that mainly focuses on residential
   building exterior walls as the first step of the national LCA tool to
   aid the design process and promote sustainable development. In addition
   to being the first initiative for a national LCA tool, the novelty of
   this work is the method of integration compared to other parametric LCA,
   which aims at optimizing both embodied and operational impact with
   respect to the Egyptian conditions while offering multiple solutions.

Title = {Optimising the material emissions of single-dwelling residential

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {While developed countries progress in environmental impact mitigation,
   developing economies struggle to lessen the severity of environmental
   impact and improve performance strategies. As of 2021, only 199 research
   publications were linked to African Life Cycle Assessment investigations
   highlighting the environmental consequences and lack of research in
   developing countries. In 2022 Ghana's global environmental performance
   was ranked 170th out of 180 countries, with a score of 27.70 out of 100,
   showing a ten-year trend of-6.1. This study aimed to optimise single
   dwelling residential buildings' material emissions from cradle to gate
   using first principles through the dynamic life cycle iteration
   protocols. The following objectives were set: 1) to identify the primary
   materials in a typical Ghanaian single-family dwelling and apply first
   principles to model the environmental impact, and 2) to replace the
   materials with an environmentally friendly type through iteration
   optimisation. The Building Information Modelling in Revit 2021 was used
   to design and take off quantities of the materials. The optimisation was
   conducted through iterations using MS Excel. The baseline model showed
   that steel and aluminium products generated frontal results of 28.64 ton
   CO2eq/m2 and 1.96 ton CO2eq/m2, representing 92\% and 6\% of the total
   GWP100, respectively. A decrease of 39\% in GWP100 emissions was made
   possible by employing concrete blocks instead of expandable lightweight
   concrete clay blocks. It is noteworthy that gypsum plasterboard had the
   lowest material impact across the GWP100, emitting 1895.40 kgCO2eq/m2,
   or 0.81 percent carbon, during the production phase. The results of this
   study can aid the many real estate developers and construction firms in
   developing nations who want to build residential homes using sustainable
   materials to lessen the effects of climate change caused by using
   building materials.},

Title = {A spatiotemporally differentiated product system modelling framework for
   consequential life cycle assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {333},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) applied to systems under
   continuous evolution, such as cities, usually disregard interactions
   among local components, how policy decisions influence them, and the
   value of spatial data. As a result, local environmental impacts might
   not be well-considered. This paper investigates how a spatially explicit
   system dynamics (SD) modelling approach can overcome such limitation,
   contributing to the advancement of CLCA. First, a novel CLCA conceptual
   framework is presented combining consequential life cycle inventories,
   SD principles and the use of spatially explicit data. Second, its
   innovative value is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept SD-CLCA
   model. This model evaluates the environmental impacts of changes in
   electricity supply-demand in the market due to an increasing adoption of
   solar photovoltaic panels (SPV) in residential buildings. It allows
   traceability of both system changes and their environmental
   consequences. For demonstration purposes, the SD-CLCA model is applied
   to Lisbon municipality and the broader electricity market of Portugal.
   Results showcase how SD-CLCA models could provide a closer
   representation of the real effects of predicted changes in the
   electricity market due to different SPV adoption scenarios. They also
   illustrate that changes in gross domestic product, population and
   precipitation provide a diversified set of impact scores. As a
   methodological advancement, and to the net of a few shortcomings, the
   proposed SD-CLCA model is able to capture the complexity of cause-effect
   dynamics determining environmental impacts, which currently represents a
   research gap in LCA.},

Abstract = {This study examines the utility of descriptive statistics and factor
   analysis in the interpretation of an LCA data set. It is believed that
   the use of descriptive statistics and factor analysis provides a
   comprehensive summary of the data, and insight on internal validity,
   which improves interpretation of results. The current study also
   provides a pretext for subsequent analyses with inferential statistics.
   Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five
   service life models (N = 45, 45 data points). Three environmental
   indicators were used to characterize the data: global warming potential
   (GWP), atmospheric eco-toxicity (ECO), and atmospheric acidification
   (ACID) from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and
   Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) assessment method. Descriptive
   statistics measured minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation,
   skewness, and kurtosis. For the factor analysis, data were disaggregated
   according to nine variables, including cumulative life cycle impact,
   major replacement, major replacement (frequency), minor replacement,
   major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2, and total
   transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). All statistical operations
   were performed using SPSS software.
   Descriptive statistics show a relatively normal data distribution for
   GWP. Data distributions for ECO and ACID deviated slightly from normal,
   which was confirmed through Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
   Factor analysis resulted in three factors for GWP and ECO, and two
   factors for ACID. In each analysis, cumulative life cycle impact, major
   replacement, and major replacement (frequency) aligned as variables in a
   common factor. This alignment corroborates previous findings. Other
   variables in the factor analysis were less clearly or inconsistently
   aligned.
   The descriptive statistics provide important information about the
   distribution of data in the study. The data are determined to be
   suitable for further analysis using inferential univariate and
   multivariate statistical tests, a topic that is examined in part 2 of
   this study as reported by Grant et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess, 2015).
   The factor analysis used in the study corroborates the conclusions of
   previous studies and provides a basis for future statistical analyses.},

Abstract = {The tools used for budgeting in the building design phase are still
   insufficient to address the life cycle of the building in terms of
   environmental and cost impacts. The main objective of this research is
   to define a model for extending existing cost databases to accommodate
   life cycle sustainability assessment. For this, current classification
   systems are reviewed and a case study has been analysed using the new
   approach. To this end, a new system of classification of construction
   information is proposed for the evaluation of early design costs, when
   data are scarce and the only information available refers to the gross
   interior area and the plot. The classification organizes the costs in a
   similar way to the sustainability assessment in EN-15643. A subcategory
   has been added for revenue, developer costs, and taxes at all stages of
   the lifecycle. The resulting classification is applied to the functional
   elements of a secondary school project. In the case study, construction
   costs represent 21\% while the use stage accounts for 72\% in a 100-year
   lifespan. The results show that, starting from generic cost bases, more
   complex costs and functional costs can be defined at different stages of
   the life cycle and adjusted to sustainability assessment standards.},

Title = {A dynamic life cycle assessment model for long-term carbon emissions
   prediction of buildings: A passive building as case study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {96},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon emissions of buildings in the life cycle are huge due to the high
   resource-intensive and energy con-sumption of the buildings industry and
   its upstream industries. And for carbon emissions prediction of the
   buildings, the life cycle assessment (LCA) with the static parameters
   input was used to obtain long-term carbon emissions for the buildings in
   the existed studies. The study presented a dynamic LCA model to predict
   life cycle carbon emissions of the buildings and optimize the insulation
   parameter with the improved temporal validation of upstream parameters.
   A case passive building was selected to perform the dynamic method based
   on the basic and operational information of this building. The key
   temporal parameters were collected and predicted via grey prediction.
   And the electric mix structure was predicted via scenario analysis
   method. The dynamic life cycle carbon emissions of energy systems were
   evaluated in different scenarios by the combination of predicting
   results and historical data. The life cycle carbon emissions of the case
   building in temporal scenarios reduced approx-imately 23.4\% of that in
   static scenario. Also, optimal insulation layer thickness in temporal
   scenarios of and that in static scenario were 130 mm, 120 mm and 250 mm,
   respectively.},

   industry, and life cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to quantify its
   benefits. Through chemical analysis, this article demonstrates that the
   current LCA is not yet well-adapted to assess the circular economy of
   building materials and components. It is shown that current inventory
   data and models are insufficient because they do not consider the uptake
   and emission of chemicals during use, the migration of chemicals within
   the value chain across the multiple phases in the circular economy, and
   because current characterization models lack a large fraction of the
   potentially emitted chemicals from said uptake and emission identified
   in the tested building material samples. Thus, it is shown that impacts
   relevant for LCA in the circular economy of buildings remain unaddressed
   because they are currently either omitted in the LCA that covers a
   limited number of impact indicators, or are ostensibly covered in the
   LCA covering a full set of indicators but missed due to inadequate
   characterization models. To ameliorate this, a definition of embedded
   toxicity and its relationship to the toxicological footprint is
   presented and a method for measurement is proposed, illustrating how
   assessing embedded toxicity can yield information for facilitating safe
   building-material reuse. Finally, a suggestion for the improvement of
   life cycle impact assessment methods is proposed.},

Title = {Comparing the life cycle costs of a traditional and a smart HVAC control
   system for Australian office buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Many smart technologies have been introduced in buildings with the aim
   to reduce the energy and GHG emissions associated with their operation,
   particularly through improved control systems for regulating heating,
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Despite their energy
   saving potential, only a few studies have comprehensively assessed the
   costs associated with their practical implementation from a life cycle
   perspective. Accordingly, this study quantifies and compares the life
   cycle costs of a smart HVAC control system with that of a traditional
   control system, in the context of an Australian office building. For
   both systems, the required hardware are specified based on the
   characteristics of these systems and the layout of the serviced spaces
   in the reference building. The costs incurred over the period of
   assessment are quantified using the net present cost (NPC) approach. To
   evaluate the effects of these control systems on the operational energy
   costs of the building HVAC system, the control logics of both these
   systems are modelled through building energy simulations. The results
   show that, over the period of assessment, the smart control system
   incurred a higher total cost compared to the traditional control system.
   However, the findings from the simulations show that the HVAC energy
   cost savings achieved through the specification of the smart control
   system offset the additional cost incurred to deploy this system over
   the traditional control system. The smart control system resulted in
   HVAC operational cost savings between 9 \% and 10 \% compared to the
   traditional control system. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the
   total life cycle costs varied between -27 \% and +50 \%, with the
   discount rate and energy price increase rate being the most influential
   parameters.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the energy and economic uncertainty of
   residential apartments using a stochastic AC behavior model and
   evaluates the appropriateness of existing building standards/codes-based
   AC setting in predicting energy and life cycle economic performance of
   energy-saving measures (e.g. wall insulation) in hot summer and cold
   winter zone of China. Monte Carlo simulation, distribution fitting and
   statistical tests were used to conduct relevant analysis. Results show
   that cooling energy uncertainty at different temporal scales is
   significant ranging from 8.59\% (annual) to 70.22\% (hourly) while
   standards/codes-based AC setting does not provide uncertainty
   information. The widely used simple assumption that the relative values
   of the energy-saving effects in actual are the same as those in thermal
   simulation (standard-based AC setting) is incorrect and there is a
   significant overestimation of cooling energy saving by standard-based AC
   setting. Further life cycle economic analysis of adding wall insulation
   shows that standards/codes-based AC setting may overestimate net present
   value (NPV) by about 1243.82\% and lead to an inappropriate design
   decision when comparing different energy-saving measures. Therefore,
   existing building standards/codes-based AC setting may lead to biased
   energy and economic prediction of energy-saving measures and
   recommendations on future building standard and policy improvements are
   provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) has long been utilized for decision making
   about the sustainability of products. LCA provides information about the
   total emissions generated for a given functional unit of a product,
   which is utilized by industries or consumers for comparing two products
   with regards to environmental performance. However, many existing LCAs
   utilize data that is representative of an average system with regards to
   life cycle stage, thus providing an aggregate picture. It has been shown
   that regional variation may lead to large variation in the environmental
   impacts of a product, specifically dealing with energy consumption,
   related emissions and resource consumptions. Hence, improving the
   reliability of LCA results for decision making with regards to
   environmental performance needs regional models to be incorporated for
   building a life cycle inventory that is representative of the origin of
   products from a certain region. In this work, we present the integration
   of regionalized data from process systems models and other sources to
   build regional LCA models and quantify the spatial variations per unit
   of biodiesel produced in the state of Indiana for environmental impact.
   In order to include regional variation, we have incorporated information
   about plant capacity for producing biodiesel from North and Central
   Indiana. The LCA model built is a cradle-to-gate. Once the
   region-specific models are built, the data were utilized in SimaPro to
   integrate with upstream processes to perform a life cycle impact
   assessment (LCIA). We report the results per liter of biodiesel from
   northern and central Indiana facilities in this work. The impact
   categories studied were global warming potential (kg CO2 eq) and
   freshwater eutrophication (kg P eq). While there were a lot of
   variations at individual county level, both regions had a similar global
   warming potential impact and the northern region had relatively lower
   eutrophication impacts.},

Abstract = {This study examines the use of inferential statistics, specifically
   multivariate correlation and regression, as a means of interpreting LCA
   data. It is believed that these methods provide additional context in
   understanding data and results, and may serve as a way to present the
   uncertain results that are inherent to LCA.
   Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five
   service life models (N = 45). Three environmental indicators were used:
   global warming potential, atmospheric ecotoxicity, and atmospheric
   acidification from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical
   and Other Environmental Impacts assessment method. Multivariate
   correlation was performed using nine variables, including cumulative
   life cycle impact, major replacement, major replacement (frequency),
   minor replacement, major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2,
   and total transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). The same data set
   was used for the regression analysis, although the variables were
   limited to major replacement, minor replacement, major repair, and minor
   repair (N = 45, 225 data points). SPSS software was used for all
   statistical calculations.
   Multivariate correlation analysis showed strong, statistically
   significant correlations between cumulative life cycle impact and major
   replacement across all environmental indicators. Similarly, the
   regression analysis showed strong R (2) values between cumulative life
   cycle impact and major replacement, such that the influence of all other
   variables was considerably diminished.
   The use of inferential statistics provides useful information with
   respect to the strength and statistical significance of correlations
   between variables as in multivariate correlation, and allows for
   predictive capacity of impact, as demonstrated through regression
   analysis. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the added value
   of these analytical tools.},

Abstract = {Demolition waste represents a significant portion of the total generated
   waste and has a high importance from both a waste management and a
   resource efficiency perspective. The urban context is highly relevant to
   assess the environmental impact of the end-of-life stage of buildings
   and potential for future reduction to properly design corresponding
   demolition waste management strategies.
   The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the
   characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the
   potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of
   buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management
   strategies. The methodology combines a bottom-up material stock model
   based on geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial temporal
   database with life cycle assessment (LCA) for the evaluation of
   end-of-life scenarios.
   The approach was tested for the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg)
   and provided significant results on the quantity and the composition of
   the housing material stock. Two alternative scenarios involving
   recycling rates of respectively 50\% and 70\% for inert materials were
   assessed and an average reduction potential of 25.6\% on abiotic
   depletion potential and 9.2\% on global warming potential was estimated.

Abstract = {In this study, several developed models have been adopted to investigate
   deterioration induced by chloride ingress by considering uncertainty in
   order to estimate the initiation and rate of corrosion. Besides, the
   structural capacity and serviceability of RC buildings, i.e. the shear
   capacity, bending strength and width of cracking or spalling of columns
   and beams with corroded reinforcing bars, were also calculated using
   simple formulas developed from previous experiments. Based on the
   information of annual spalling/cracking and failure probabilities, the
   deterioration risk of an RC building attacked by chloride can be
   evaluated using the concept of reliability of a series system. In order
   to find the optimal maintenance plan, probabilistic effect assessment
   models for repair/retrofit strategies (five repair/retrofit strategies
   were selected) that consider the recurrence of deterioration in repaired
   areas and the deterioration proceeding in unrepaired areas were
   developed in this research. These models reflect the effects of the
   maintenance strategies on the failure and spalling probability directly
   and can be used to estimate the life-cycle performance and cost of RC
   buildings. Finally, on the basis of the minimal life-cycle cost, the
   optimal life-cycle maintenance strategy can also be identified by using
   the genetic algorithm; case studies were used to discuss the
   applicability of this system.},

Title = {An axiomatic method for goal-dependent allocation in life cycle

Abstract = {Purpose How to apply allocation in an life cycle assessment (LCA) is a
   long-running and controversial debate. Consensus seems to exist on the
   fact that the allocation procedure should follow logically from the LCA
   goal definition. This paper proposes to use an axiomatic method to (1)
   identify an allocation procedure for co-production, joint treatment, and
   recycling, that best responds to a specific LCA goal and (2) communicate
   the rationale applied by the LCA practitioner transparently. The method
   is illustrated via a case study. Materials and methods The specific goal
   definition for which a suitable allocation procedure is identified is to
   evaluate what impacts can be attributed to a product, which could inform
   a company about potential sources of reputation damage. Subjective
   assumptions that reflect our vision of ``what impacts can be attributed
   to a product{''} are described in definitions and axioms. Results and
   discussion Axioms are formulated that describe the system boundaries of
   the product system and the partitioning criterion. The derived
   allocation procedure corresponds to ``Allocation at the Point of
   Substitution,{''} which is applied in one of the system models of
   ecoinvent. Partitioning is based on market information, which
   corresponds to a cause-oriented perspective on ``what impacts can be
   attributed to a product.{''} Other LCA goal definitions and rationales
   could require different system boundaries or a different partitioning
   criterion. Conclusions and perspectives The axiomatic method presented
   in this paper supports the identification of a suitable allocation
   procedure for a defined LCA goal and the transparent communication of
   the rationale that backs up this procedure. Building forth on the
   approach of this paper, a collection of axioms and corresponding
   allocation procedures could be developed on which consensus might exist
   within the LCA community. Such goal-dependent allocation procedures
   could form the basis of future guidance on LCA.},

Title = {An integrated life cycle assessment of different facade systems for a
   typical residential building in Ghana},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study performs a comparative environmental and economic assessment
   of four different facade systems for low-cost residential buildings in
   Ghana. A framework is designed to incorporate BIM, Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) to perform a holistic comparison of a
   Shotcrete Insulated Composite Facade (Shotcrete ICF), Galvanised Steel
   Insulated Composite facade (G. Steel ICF) and Stabilised Earth Block
   Facade (SEBF) against the conventional Concrete Block and Mortar Facade
   (CBMF). BIM models are developed to compute the environmental and
   economic impacts of each facade. The results are then subjected to a
   comparative analysis for different life cycle stages. The SEBF is proved
   to be the most sustainable facade as it reduces cumulative energy demand
   (CED) by 39.13 \%, global warming potential (GWP) by 18.07 \% and LCC by
   47.87 \% compared to CBMF. The Shotcrete IFC and G. Steel IFC are found
   to increase CED but decrease GWP. Other than the SEBF, the ranking of
   all facades under different indicators changes through the scenario
   analysis. The findings of this study provide useful guidelines for
   selecting facade systems and reducing the environmental and economic
   impacts of low-cost residential buildings in Ghana.},

Title = {Life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of a traditional and a
   smart HVAC control system for Australian office buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, many novel smart technologies have been proposed to
   reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   attributed to the building sector. One such application of these
   technologies is the reduction of the Heating, Ventilation and Air
   Conditioning (HVAC) energy needs and GHG emissions using smart control
   systems. The environmental benefits of smart control systems during
   building operation have been explored in many studies, however, their
   embodied effects, associated with the extraction of raw materials,
   manufacturing and replacement are often overlooked. Accordingly, this
   study quantifies the life cycle energy needs and GHG emissions of a
   smart HVAC control system and assesses its potential for reducing the
   HVAC operational energy and GHG emissions in an Australian office
   building. A comparative assessment is performed, considering a
   traditional HVAC control system and an equivalent smart HVAC control
   system. The components of both the traditional and smart control systems
   are specified based on the characteristics of these systems as well as
   the layout of the serviced spaces in the reference building. The
   embodied energy and GHG emissions of both the traditional and smart
   control systems are quantified through a hybrid life cycle inventory
   (LCI) approach. To evaluate the effects of these control systems on the
   building HVAC operational energy, a building energy simulation is
   performed by applying the control logics of both systems. The results
   show that energy and GHG emissions savings in the HVAC operational
   offset the additional energy needs and GHG emissions of deploying the
   smart HVAC control system.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper seeks to identify the most environmental friendly way
   of conducting a refurbishment of Broendby Strand, with focus on PCB
   remediation. The actual identification is conducted by comparing four
   remediation techniques using urban metabolism fused with life cycle
   assessment (UM-LCA) in combination with information relating to cost and
   efficiency of the compared techniques. The methodological goal of our
   paper is to test UM-LCA as a decision support tool and discuss
   application of the method in relation to large refurbishment
   projects.MethodsTo assess the environmental performance of
   PCB-remediation techniques, the UM-LCA method was applied. By combining
   UM and LCA methodologies, the total environmental impact potentials of
   the remediation techniques were calculated. To build an inventory for
   each technique, we contacted and interviewed experts and studied
   existing literature, cases, and projects in order to compile information
   on practical details of the techniques. To process the collected
   inventory data, we used the simplified product system modeling software
   Quantis Suite 2.0 (QS2.0). In order to validate the results from the
   simplified software, we carried out the exact same analysis using a more
   complex toolOpenLCA 1.5. Based on the assessment results, we compared
   the remediation techniques and identified the techniques with the
   smallest and largest environmental impact potentials.Results and
   discussionThe results obtained are presented, and the technique with the
   smallest impact identified. A comparison between the two software tools
   applied is made, and differences between the two are discussed in
   detail. Further discussed is how possible inventory errors affect the
   results and if any assumptions should be considered as critical for the
   final results. Furthermore, are the remediation efficiencies of each
   technique and the cost of each method considered and compared. Finally,
   UM-LCA's ability to work as a tool for decision support is discussed and
   possible ways of implementing the method in sustainable decision-making
   is considered.ConclusionsIn this study, it is found that the most
   environmental friendly PCB-remediation technique is thermal desorption,
   whereas the technique with the largest environmental impact potential is
   sand blasting, due to the environmental impacts induced in relation to
   disposal of the building waste. It is concluded that the UM-LCA method
   can be applied as a tool for decision support, and if economic aspects
   are incorporated, the UM-LCA approach could be an essential approach for
   designing sustainable buildings.},

Abstract = {As the key for building the new power system and achieving the
   ``dual-carbon{''} goal, the development of electric vehicle industry is
   closely connected with the supporting and improvement of charging and
   swapping infrastructure. However, the difficult cost recovery and
   unbalanced regional development appeared due to the low utilization as
   well as nonstandard siting and sizing of charging and swapping
   infrastructure. In order to guide the investment and construction of
   charging and swapping infrastructure correctly and effectively, it is
   essential to conduct in-depth research with respect to siting and sizing
   of charging and swapping infrastructure at this stage. On the basis of
   Particle Swarm Optimization, this paper builds an optimization model of
   siting and sizing for the fast charging stations through dividing
   regions in accordance with the charging demand of electric taxi, the
   geographical information of inapplicable location and other factors. The
   case result indicates that the model proposed herein is capable of
   improving economic benefits of investment operators and guiding the
   investment and construction of AC charging piles by means of maximizing
   the net income of the charging station throughout full life cycle, and
   determining the geographic location of charging stations and the
   quantities of charging piles to be configured. After optimizing the
   location of charging stations, it can maximize life-cycle net incomes of
   675.86 million yuan and determine the optimized amounts of charging
   piles in each charing station are 159, 339 and 563, respectively.},

Title = {Proposed time-dependent approach to seismic loss evaluation through the
   life cycle of a structure},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {280-290},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, an efficient time-dependent approach to seismic loss
   evaluation is proposed to calculate the probability distribution
   function of the life cycle cost of a structure. In the current
   literature, the evaluation of seismic loss has almost exclusively
   focused on estimating the mean value of the life cycle cost which does
   not include the information about the full extent of seismic loss
   variability. The proposed method aims to employ the FEMA-P-58 approach
   in evaluating the probabilistic distribution of total seismic repair
   cost in the life cycle of a structure. This method also considers the
   effect of time-dependent phenomena on loss evaluation while it keeps the
   required computational effort at an affordable level. A Monte Carlo
   sampling technique is applied to consider all sources of uncertainties.
   In this approach, the appropriate response distribution of the structure
   is extracted from the incremental dynamic analysis results, and there is
   no need to repeat complex dynamic analysis calculations in each
   realization. To better demonstrate the proposed method, the life cycle
   cost of a 5-story steel special moment frame is investigated with
   various assumptions on its time-dependent specifications such as the
   monetary discounting effects, the influence of different discount rates
   and building depreciation over time.},

Abstract = {Life-cycle costing is an important part of every construction project,
   as it makes it possible to take into consideration future costs relating
   to the operation and demolition phase of a built structure. In this way,
   investors can optimize the project design to minimize the total project
   costs. Even though there have already been some attempts to implement
   BIM software in the Czech Republic, the current state of affairs does
   not support automated data flow between the bill of costs and
   applications that support building facility management. The main aim of
   this study is to critically evaluate the current situation and outline a
   future framework that should allow for the use of the data contained in
   the bill of costs to manage building operating costs.},

Title = {Streamlined environmental and cost life-cycle approach for building
   thermal retrofits: A case of residential buildings in South European
   climates},

Abstract = {Building retrofits are often motivated by the desire to improve the
   energy efficiency of a building. However, environmental burdens
   associated with additional materials used to accomplish energy
   efficiency are not usually taken into account. Life-cycle assessment
   (LCA) and life-cycle cost assessment (LCCA) approaches have been
   extensively applied to analyze building environmental impacts and costs.
   However, LCA and LCCA are time-consuming and resource-intensive and are
   usually performed in late design stages when significant reduction in
   total life-cycle impacts is costly to achieve. The aim of this article
   is to present an integrated, streamlined LCA-LCCA approach to building
   retrofits to provide feedback on environmental impacts and costs at
   early-design stage decisions. We propose a framework that fully
   integrates a streamlined embodied LCA, statistical-based operational
   energy, and cost models. This approach incorporates uncertainty to
   address the lack of information in early design stages by using the
   building attribute to impact algorithm approach, which includes
   structured under-specification and probabilistic triage. An automated
   process enables several scenarios to be assessed and compared as a means
   of better informing designers of the relative environmental impact of
   materials and dimensioning choices. It is demonstrated that by selecting
   very few attributes and then comparing several options, robust retrofit
   decisions can be made in early-design stages, thereby promoting a
   reduction in environmental impacts and costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Kindergartens play a crucial role in nurturing the physical, cognitive,
   and social development of children. Hence, designing kindergarten
   buildings requires the consideration of the unique requirements and
   behavior of children. Considering the rapid urbanization of China and
   its commitment to achieving the 3060 carbon goal, in this study, we
   examine the retrofitting of kindergarten buildings in China and propose
   a retrofit optimization method for kindergarten buildings that considers
   thermal comfort, daylighting, and life-cycle carbon emissions. Through
   this method, information on the thermal and daylighting comfort of
   occupants, weather data, occupant scheduling, and envelope and energy
   system of the kindergarten building to be retrofitted can be obtained
   through various approaches, such as video playback, field investigation,
   literature research, and consult drawings. On this basis, optimization
   variables are selected, and a physical model is established to guide the
   retrofit process. Afterward, a rapid comprehensive optimization
   framework based on parallel computing is adopted to obtain the
   comprehensive optimal design scheme for the building to be retrofitted.
   The proposed method is applied to a kindergarten building retrofit case
   in Nanjing, China, and the results show that the optimal comprehensive
   scheme results in a reduction in carbon emissions of 34,158.3 kg, an
   increase in the thermal comfort period of 2.7\%, and an improvement in
   daylighting comfort of 79.7\% over the benchmark scheme. The
   significance of this study extends beyond its potential for widespread
   application in kindergarten building retrofits. It contributes to
   advancing sustainable building design and environmental stewardship,
   creating healthier and more comfortable learning environments for
   children while mitigating the environmental impact of buildings.
   Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of considering children's unique
   needs and behaviors in building design, ultimately leading to better
   outcomes for their overall development.},

Title = {Feature selection for indoor temperature prediction in large-space
   buildings based on transfer entropy and life cycle cost},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Indoor temperature prediction as an essential reference for heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system tuning has boomed in
   recent years, with the development of information technology. But for
   data-driven techniques, inputs as key factors in prediction accuracy,
   learning efficiency and generalization capacity, did not pay enough
   attention. Existing research focused only on prediction accuracy by
   copying previous practices in other fields like medicine and hydrology,
   without considering prediction horizons and economic costs, which is
   meaningless and even may mislead the configuration of the monitoring
   system, especially for large-space buildings with long-span space,
   diverse zones and coupling parameters. In this work, a novel hybrid
   feature selection technique for indoor temperature prediction was
   developed. Herein, transfer entropy (TE) was introduced into filter to
   evaluate importance of features, where Max-min TE as a gauge was defined
   to cope with time delays in HVAC system; Then gated recurrent network
   was taken in wrapper as a bridge to transform evaluations in filter into
   contributions to prediction; Lastly, life cycle cost was employed as a
   referee to judge cost-efficient alternatives. The proposed technique was
   validated by time-series data collected from a library and system energy
   consumption baseline simulated with TRNSYS to suggest optimal feature
   subsets under different prediction horizons.},

Abstract = {Nearly half of the global annual energy supply is consumed by the
   building construction sector, indicating an enormous potential to
   minimize the carbon footprint. During its life cycle, a building
   consumes energy in the form of embodied and operational energy. Embodied
   energy (EE) is expended in processes during construction (ex: extraction
   of raw material, transportation, manufacturing, etc.). Operating energy
   (OE) is spent on operating and maintaining the building to ensure
   occupant comfort. Unlike OE, the methods used to calculate EE are
   complex, unstandardized, and time-consuming. Each EE calculation method
   utilizes different sources of data and system boundary definitions,
   therefore making it difficult to comprehensively evaluate building life
   cycle energy (LCE). Literature suggests that the disaggregated
   input-output based hybrid (IOH) approach is more accurate, complete, and
   reliable in comparison to the other EE calculation methods. In this
   study, we examine the EE-OE relationship by calculating EE factors for a
   newly constructed and renovated educational building. Next, we also
   compare the variation in EE factors across different life cycle
   inventory (LCI) methods (process-based, aggregated IOH, and
   disaggregated IOH). The results of this study indicate that using
   different LCI techniques to calculate EE causes massive variations in EE
   factors, which represent the EE expense of saving one unit of OE. The
   findings of our study and literature review show that the process-based
   approach underestimates EE, therefore the values of EE factors
   calculated using this approach need to be interpreted with caution.
   These results further elucidate the importance of standardizing the EE
   calculation method.},

Title = {Improving the decision-making for sustainable demolition waste
   management by combining a BIM-based life cycle sustainability assessment
   framework and hybrid MCDA approach},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 8},
Abstract = {Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition
   waste management (DWM) from a life cycle-thinking perspective. To this
   end, facilitating sustainability-oriented decision-making for DWM
   planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing
   multifaceted criteria. This study develops a building information
   modelling (BIM)-based DWM sustainability assessment approach to
   facilitate the life cycle assessment (LCA) and decision-making by
   coupling the enriched Industry Foundation Classes model with hybrid
   multi-criteria decision-aiding (MCDA) methods using Dynamo visual
   scripting. To streamline the data-intensive LCA process, this study
   enriched the BIM properties and accommodated them into the LCA data
   template to enhance data interoperability, thus achieving seamless data
   transfer. Moreover, hybrid MCDA methods are integrated into the
   decision-making workflow for DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study is
   employed to verify the applicability of the decision-aiding framework.
   The results unveil that the sustainability score ascended with the
   recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the highest recycling
   rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63. Conversely, a DWM
   alternative reflecting the `status quo' in China's recycling industry
   has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower than the baseline
   scenario with a 50\% recycling rate. It is worth noting that the `growth
   curve' of the sustainability score continuously flattens as the target
   recycling rate escalates. The increment in recycling rate from the
   `Australian standard' scenario to the optimal scenario is 18.4\%,
   whereas the sustainability score merely increases by 2.3\%, signalling
   that the former scenario arrived at an optimum point for maximising the
   cost-efficiency of DWM under the predefined framework and contexts.},

Title = {Use of GIS and BIM tools in determining the life cycle impact of urban
   systems. Case study: Residential buildings which apply the
   Eco-Efficiency Matrix in the city of Quito, Ecuador},

Abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on
   changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction,
   which generates approximately 33\% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere
   and con-tributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present,
   interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of
   various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact.
   Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently
   linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75\% of carbon
   emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban
   concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically
   visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement
   routes were located according to the types of transport used and the
   location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as
   points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several
   tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level.
   The impact of the building in the production, construction,
   de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use
   of the three tools -LCA, BIM and GIS -allowed us to establish that the
   highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high
   consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in
   Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental
   impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore
   essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix,
   which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.},

Abstract = {Arch bridges made of natural stone masonry nowadays rank among the
   oldest, structures still in service in the road and railroad
   infrastructure. Some of them with ages of more than 100 years, represent
   a historically very valuable building fabric. In Austria's railroad
   network alone there are around 1,000 arch bridges still in operation. In
   whole Europe the estimated number of masonry railroad bridges amounts to
   70,000. Nowadays increasingly more attention is paid to the maintenance
   and rehabilitation of existing arch bridges than on their
   reconstruction, as a result of financial reasons as well as monument
   conservation aspects. Since those bridges usually have been projected
   for very different loads, assessments concerning the current bearing
   capacity and the future utilization are required. A recalculation with
   conventional calculation methods is often insufficient as results can
   considerably deviate from the actual load capacity due to various
   influencing factors. The challenge therefore is to find and verify more
   accurate methods to determine the actual condition of such arch bridges.
   A point of interest is the combination of finite element modeling
   strategies of masonry with inspection and monitoring strategies of
   existing structures. Inspections enable the detection of ``damage{''},
   whereby damage is defined as changes in material as well as geometric
   properties of a structure. The applications of monitoring systems allow
   a continuous observation of a system over time. In case of long term
   observations, the output of this process is a periodically updated
   information regarding the ability of the structure to perform its tasks.
   Within the proposed contribution a generally valid methodology for the
   performance and lifetime assessment of masonry arch bridges based on
   nonlinear finite element analysis and monitoring data will be presented.
   Further two different approaches for the assessment of extreme values
   and probability of failure will be discussed. The two approaches will be
   applied to a railroad arch bridge located in Austria.},

Abstract = {Construction is a crucial sector in terms of worldwide environmental
   impacts. Building material production along with transport and
   demolition are no exception, because in the last decades, they have
   constantly increased their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Actions and
   initiatives are therefore important to tackle the relationship between
   buildings and climate change. Particularly, it is necessary to develop
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools useful to calculate the environmental
   impact of buildings and to make them accessible to designers and
   stakeholders acting in the building sector. The article aims to
   contribute to the international debate about environmental assessment
   indicators for buildings and the simplified LCA based tools. The
   Embodied Energy (EE) and the Embodied Carbon (EC) have been
   investigated. The former, related to primary energy content; the latter,
   associated with the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. EE and EC have
   been used as indicators for the development of a calculation tool named
   EURECA, for assessing the environmental impact of the building over its
   life cycle, as defined by the EN 15978:2011 standard. The Solar
   Decathlon Latin America and Caribbean's house designed and built by an
   international academic team has been an opportunity to check the
   indicators and the tool's effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Building-integrated concentrating photovoltaic (PV) systems are of great
   interest, offering several advantages for building and environment. The
   present study is an advancement towards the life cycle assessment (LCA)
   of a linear dielectric-based building-integrated concentrating PV system
   by means of multiple life-cycle impact assessment methods and
   environmental indicators (ReCiPe, Eco-indicator 99, ecological
   footprint, USEtox, ReCiPe-based and Eco-indicator-99-based payback times
   (PBT5), etc.), providing a detailed analysis. Two configurations (with
   and without reflective film) are examined, for different cities
   (Barcelona, Exeter and Dublin). By focussing on material manufacturing
   (system with reflective film), in general, ReCiPe
   (endpoint/single-score; points) results are in accordance to
   Ecoindicator 99 (single-score; points) findings and based on both
   methods PVs have the maximum contribution for ecosystems/ecosystem
   quality and human health. Moreover, based on USEtox results, there is a
   remarkable difference between the impact of the PVs and the impact of
   the other components. With regard to the PBT5, taking into account both
   configurations with/without reflective film, Barcelona presents the
   lowest ReCiPe and Eco-indicator-99 PBT5 ranging from 3.6 to 5.8 years.
   On the other hand, Exeter and Dublin show PBTs from 3.7 to 7.8 years.
   According to ReCiPe/endpoint results with characterization, for climate
   change/human health (system with reflective film) Barcelona shows 1.2 x
   10(-7) disability adjusted -life-years per kWh while Dublin and Exeter
   present a footprint of present about 1.8 x 10(-7)
   disability-adjusted-life-years per kWh. Results in terms of
   (species.yr)/kWh are also presented (ReCiPe/endpoint with
   characterization), for several scenarios. Regarding the two
   configurations, the findings based on multiple approaches verify that
   reflective film considerably improves the eco-profile of the reference
   system (configuration without reflective film). For example, by
   utilizing reflective film there is a reduction of ReCiPe-based and
   Eco-indicator-99-based PBT5 ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 years, depending on
   the scenario. Finally, results from the literature are presented along
   with. results of the present study and a critical discussion is
   provided. Conclusively, the proposed LCA model can also be applied to
   similar systems, providing useful information about their environmental
   profile and offering the possibility to select among different
   configurations the best from ecological/cleaner production point of
   view. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of ships with special consideration of ship
   scrapping},
Journal = {MATERIAUX \& TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Global trade is depending on the seaborne transport of goods. Over two
   thirds of the transport worldwide is carried by ships. After the
   financial crisis in 2008 the worldwide economy experienced turbulences
   which had a direct impact on the volume of trade. All of a sudden there
   was an overcapacity of ships cruising on the oceans of the world. Many
   of the older ships were decommissioned and scrapped. Numerous scrapyards
   are in South Asia, where the ships are dismantled under harsh working
   conditions and with no environmental protection measures. A lot of these
   scrap yards are merely beaches where the ships are beached
   (beach-breaking yards) and disassembled manually. International
   agreements and efforts exist to tackle this kind of end-of-life
   treatment of ships which is dangerous for humans and the environment.
   One example is the Basel Convention to control hazardous waste, to which
   disposed ships also belong. In 2009 the Hong Kong Convention was
   adopted, which aims at reducing the risks to human health, safety and to
   the environment during the recycling of ships. Just recently the
   European Commission has adopted the EU Ship Recycling Regulation to
   reduce the negative impacts linked to the recycling of EU-flagged ships.
   The Regulation sets out a number of requirements for European ships,
   European ship owners and ship recycling facilities. Confronting existing
   challenges of ship scrapping and the international activities to tackle
   these challenges a literature research is performed to assess in what
   way the end-of-life of ships has been covered in LCA studies. Based on
   these findings an own approach to an end-of-life (EoL) assessment is set
   up and illustrated by an example. In order to develop a comprehensive
   assessment of the EoL of cargo ships, a simplified model based on the
   mentioned preexisting information is created. All three phases: ship
   building, ship operation and ship scrapping are taken into account. Two
   scenario groups for the ship scrapping were defined, with different
   approaches to re-use and recycling. The overall contribution of the
   end-of-life phase to the life cycle (construction of the ship, Use, EoL)
   of a ship is ranged and evaluated. The results of the assessed scenarios
   confirm that the re-use and recycling process is environmentally
   preferable. However, the processes and human labour have not been taken
   into account yet. The overall impact on the lifecycle remains negligible
   within the assessed impact categories. A more significant impact of the
   EoL on the lifecycle might be seen if other impact categories, such as
   indicators for resource efficiency are taken into account.},

Title = {Developing a Framework for Dynamic Organizational Resilience Analysis in
   Prefabricated Construction Projects: A Project Life Cycle Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Prefabricated construction has recently played an increasingly
   significant role in social, environmental, and economic developments in
   the construction sector. Because prefabricated construction projects
   (PCPs) are interorganizational in nature, their successful delivery,
   especially under uncertain circumstances, relies on organizational
   resilience performance throughout the life cycle. The purpose of this
   study is to develop an ethnography-based methodological framework for
   the PCPs to evaluate, analyze, and improve the dynamic organizational
   resilience regarding efficiency, flexibility, and robustness from a life
   cycle perspective. A two-part framework is developed. The qualitative
   first part identifies the roles and relationships of participating
   stakeholders during each project phase, and the second quantitative part
   measures and analyzes the PCP's organizational resilience. A typical
   engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract PCP in China
   is used as a case analysis to assess the validity of this developed
   framework. The results show that the robustness and flexibility of the
   PCP should be improved. Such improvement can be achieved by managing and
   enhancing the workflow control and how stakeholders communicate. This
   scenario was examined via a comparative analysis of employing building
   information model (BIM) and decentralized collaboration platform (DCP)
   within the case project. Finally, this developed framework could be used
   as a practical decision-making tool for managers to improve the
   organizational resilience in the aspects of efficiency, flexibility, and
   robustness of PCPs in case unforeseen events are encountered. It
   contributes to the current knowledge body of PCPs by incorporating
   organizational resilience theory into its performance evaluation and
   improvements.},

Abstract = {Considering future seismic risk and life-cycle cost, the life-cycle
   seismic design of bridge is formulated as a preference-based
   multi-objective optimization and decision-making problem, in which the
   conflicting design criteria that minimize life-cycle cost and maximize
   seismic capacity are treated simultaneously. Specifically, the
   preference information based on theoretical analysis and engineering
   judgment is embedded in the optimization procedure. Based on reasonable
   displacement ductility, the cost preference and safety preference
   information are used to progressively construct value function,
   directing the evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm's
   search to more preferred solutions. The seismic design of a reinforced
   concrete pier is presented as an application example using the proposed
   procedure for the global Pareto front corresponding with engineering
   designers' preference. The results indicate that the proposed model is
   available to find the global Pareto front satisfying the corresponding
   preference and overcoming the difficulties of the traditional
   multi-objective optimization algorithm in obtaining a full approximation
   of the entire Pareto optimal front for large-dimensional problems as
   well as cognitive difficulty in selecting one preferred solution from
   all these solutions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to integrate stochastic approaches in the
   life cycle cost analysis of sewer pipes. It is generally accepted that
   costs are of the greatest interest to the decision maker. The selection
   procedure primarily depends on the material availability as well as
   empirical information. Afterward costs in the maintenance phase lack
   consideration, which is mainly constrained by data availability and
   analysis techniques. This study focuses on the rigid pipe and evaluates
   the comparable application of reinforced concrete pipe (RCP),
   non-reinforced concrete pipe (NRCP), and vitrified clay pipe (VCP) in
   sewer systems. The life cycle cost analysis is performed throughout the
   material manufacturing, construction and maintenance phases.
   Particularly, the Markov chain model is used to predict systems'
   conditions that are used as a guidance for management in the maintenance
   phase. Under a given strategy, the cost estimate is extended to the
   steady state, providing a new cost comparison perspective. In addition,
   methods to evaluate the model uncertainty are also presented. Applying
   the bootstrapping approach, the analysis reveals that the Markov chains
   model demonstrates decent robustness. In the case study of a 24-in. pipe
   application, results show that NRCP demands the least initial building
   cost, while RCP is more cost effective considering longer service life
   time. Cost comparison and specific examples are also presented to
   demonstrate practical applications. This integrated approach allows
   decision-makers and stakeholders to understand and compare economic
   costs during alternative selections in practice. The methodology
   developed may also be applied in the life cycle analysis of other
   critical infrastructure systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Hospital buildings provide healthcare services at the costs of
   significant amounts of energy consumption and carbon emissions, further
   exacerbating the environmental load. Because of the limited research on
   the life cycle carbon emissions of Chinese hospitals, this study
   conducted a detailed carbon-accounting and comparative study. Firstly,
   BIM and LCA were used to quantify the carbon emissions of the inpatient
   building in each stage of the life cycle. Secondly, the differences in
   carbon emissions by stage were compared on the basis of 20 cases of
   public buildings. The results show that the whole-life carbon emissions
   of the inpatient building was 10,459.94 kgCO2/m2. The proportion of
   operational carbon emissions was 94.68\%, with HVAC (52.57\%), equipment
   (27.85\%), and lighting (10.11\%) being the main sources. Embodied
   carbon emissions accounted for 4.54\%, and HRB400 steel and C30 concrete
   were the main sources of carbon emissions. Hospitals are second only to
   emporiums in terms of operational carbon intensity, being 1.71 and 1.41
   times that of schools and office buildings, with inpatient buildings
   being 3 and 1.7 times that of medical complexes and outpatient
   buildings, respectively. The future sustainable development of hospital
   buildings should promote efficient building performance and good
   environmental quality, both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon
   reduction.},

Abstract = {Investment decisions for buildings made today largely determine their
   environmental impacts over many future decades due to their long
   lifetimes. Such decisions involve a trade-off between additional
   investments today and potential savings during use and at end of life -
   in terms of economic costs, primary energy consumption, greenhouse gas
   emissions and other environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA)
   is suited to identify measures and action to increase the resource
   efficiency and the environmental performance of buildings and
   construction. This paper gives an overview of an ongoing international
   research project within the IEA EBC with the overall aim to harmonise
   LCA approaches on buildings and foster life cycle thinking in the real
   estate and construction sectors. The objectives of the project are i) to
   establish a common methodology guideline to assess the life cycle based
   environmental impacts caused by buildings, ii) to establish methods for
   the development of specific environmental benchmarks for different types
   of buildings, iii) to derive regionally differentiated guidelines and
   tools for the use of LCA in building design and tools such as BIM, and
   iv) to improve data availability by developing national or regional
   databases with regionally differentiated LCA data tailored to the
   construction sector. To ensure practical solutions a number of case
   studies will be used to test and illustrate the consensus approaches and
   research issues.},

Title = {Internet of Things for building facade traceability: A theoretical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Traceability is considered a crucial requirement to enable Circular
   Economy (CE). Product and process life-cycle data can facilitate
   circular asset management preserving the asset's value over time and
   reducing resource consumption. Many scholars point out how the loss of
   traceability data, lacking information reliability, and unstructured
   data are still barriers to the widespread application of CE. In the
   building facade sector, an increased interest on traceability is
   dictated by a growing demand for environmental product certifications.
   However, these aspects are often limited to collect data at supply chain
   stage, thus neglecting a huge amount of information produced during the
   asset service life. To foster an accessible and life-cycle oriented
   asset traceability, this research investigates the Internet of Things
   (IoT) as a potentially disruptive technology for supporting information
   management. The objective of this work is twofold: (i) to identify what
   facade life-cycle information is needed to promote CE and (ii) to
   clarify the enabling role of IoT in tracking, storing, and sharing such
   information. Through a scoping review combined with interviews to
   professionals, a theoretical framework structured on four key elements
   (stakeholders, information list, information management tools, and IoT)
   is proposed to fill the literature gap and support facade industry in
   the circular transition. Further research will have to be conducted to
   face the digital-physical integration issues and develop business models
   able to fully exploit traceability information value.},

Title = {A Method to Include Life Cycle Assessment Results in Choosing by

   Seismic Retrofit in Peruvian Primary Schools},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technology that
   improves visualization, understanding, and transparency in construction
   projects. Its use in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA\&C), while
   still scarce, is developing in combination with multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) methods, such as the choosing by advantages (CBA)
   method. Despite the holistic nature of MCDM methods, the inclusion of
   life cycle environmental metrics is lagging in construction projects in
   LA\&C. However, recent studies point toward the need to optimize the
   synergies between BIM and life cycle assessment (LCA), in which a method
   like CBA could allow improving the quality of the decisions. Therefore,
   the main objective of this study is to integrate LCA and CBA methods to
   identify the effect that the inclusion of environmental impacts can have
   on decision-making in public procurement, as well as comparing how this
   final decision differs from an exclusively LCA-oriented interpretation
   of the results. Once the LCA was performed, a set of additional criteria
   for the CBA method were fixed, including transparency, technical, and
   social indicators. Thereafter, a stakeholder participative workshop was
   held in order to gather experts to elucidate on the final decision. The
   methodology was applied to a relevant construction sector problem
   modelled with BIM in the city of Lima (Peru), which consisted of three
   different construction techniques needed to retrofit educational
   institutions. Results from the LCA-oriented assessment, which was
   supported by Monte Carlo simulation, revealed a situation in which the
   masonry-based technique showed significantly lower environmental impacts
   than the remaining two options. However, when a wider range of
   technical, social, and transparency criteria are added to the
   environmental indicators, this low-carbon technique only prevailed in
   those workshop tables in which environmental experts were present and
   under specific computational assumptions, whereas teams with a higher
   proportion of government members were inclined to foster alternatives
   that imply less bureaucratic barriers. Finally, the results constitute
   an important milestone when it comes to including environmental factors
   in public procurement in LA\&C.},

Abstract = {The rural household biogas program in China has been regarded as an
   effective approach to address energy shortage issues and to reduce
   carbon emission in rural areas. After more than fifty years of
   development, it has neither succeeded in rural energy substitution nor
   achieved other social and environmental goals, although available
   studies have shown otherwise. The reason behind this disparity largely
   lies in inaccurate adoption of the operational cycle, i.e., the fact
   that the actual operational time of the biogas digester was often
   overestimated. Presented In this paper, an EIO-LCA model using the
   Chinese Economic Input-Output table of 2007 was built to estimate
   carbon-dioxide (CO2) emission during the life cycle of a typical 8 m(3)
   household biogas digester and their sources with regard to economic
   sectors. The life cycle of a biogas digester can be divided into three
   stages: construction (including pond building and pen, toilet and stove
   alterations), operation (including maintenance and biogas combustion)
   and disposal. The results show that the net CO2 emission of a biogas
   digester is 1558.91 kg after one year of operation, which corresponds to
   an actual CO2 emission of 2878.30 kg (of which direct and indirect
   emissions are 1558.90 and 1319.40 kg, respectively) and an emission
   reduction by fuel substitution and fertilizer conservation of 1078.59
   and 240.80 kg, respectively. Therefore, the model indicates that a
   biogas digester should be run for at least 2.77 years to have a net CO2
   emission reduction benefit. The model also indicates that comprehensive
   utilization of biogas and its byproducts is very important for carbon
   emission in rural areas. Most of the indirect emissions were derived
   from construction materials, accounting for 88.18\%. Moreover, the
   smelting and pressing of ferrous metals in the 43-step production chain
   of construction materials accounted for 22.48\% of the indirect
   emissions. This gives us a novel perspective to develop emission
   reduction policies. Taken together, the results obtained in this study
   provide substantial information for policy-making on biogas promotion
   and management as well as renewable energy development in rural China.

Title = {An open building information modelling based co-simulation architecture
   to model building energy and environmental life cycle assessment: A case
   study on two buildings in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg},

Abstract = {Given the complexity and interconnection of different aspects involved
   in building evaluation, one of the most relevant, and challenging,
   research topics is the integration of different domain models (such as
   thermal comfort, indoor environmental quality and occupant comfort) to
   effectively describe and inform improvement strategies for the behaviour
   and performance of a building and building stock. Currently, this
   problem is unsolved with only one study attempting to integrate building
   energy simulation and life cycle assessments (separately, both practices
   are utilised to facilitate the design and management of buildings,
   traditionally consultancies offer building energy simulation services -
   most commonly for regulatory purposes - and more recently life cycle
   impact assessments), whilst no work has attempted this integration in a
   dynamic manner. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic,
   open building information modelling based co-simulation architecture.
   This architecture is the first to tightly couple and integrate
   EnergyPlus and Brightway2, in a way that does not rely upon heuristics
   or simplified tools. Furthermore, it is the first building energy
   simulation and life cycle assess-ment co-simulation to enable
   time-differentiated (dynamic) results and the first to be enabled only
   by open technologies. The architecture has been validated against two
   case-study non-domestic buildings located in the United Kingdom and
   Luxembourg, demonstrating its applicability to the construction and
   operational life cycle phases of buildings. The work presented in this
   paper has shown how a time-differentiated co-simulation approach across
   energy and lifecycle domains enables a more holistic analysis of whole
   buildings with greater accuracy and granularity.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel vision of paperless and visual lifecycle
   building management tools based on the coupling between Building
   Information Models (BIM) and Augmented Reality (AR) called Lifecycle
   Building Card. As the use of BIM increases within the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industries, new opportunities emerge to
   help stakeholders and maintenance operators to leverage the BIM dataset
   for lifecycle issues using realtime environments and simulation. In
   particular, a tighter coupling of BIM with computer vision techniques
   could enable innovative lifecycle management tools based on AR concepts.
   In this context, this work explores the possibilities and derives
   theoretical and practical concepts for the use of BIM enhanced by AR for
   supporting maintenance activities in buildings. An implementation of a
   wireless spatially aware display is presented as a first step toward the
   stated vision.},

Title = {A critical analysis of the integration of life cycle methods and
   quantitative methods for sustainability assessment},
Journal = {CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 29},
Abstract = {The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its corresponding
   methodologies gained considerable attention within the realm of
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability assessment.
   Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration
   along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques
   and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this
   literature review is to investigate the extent to which these
   methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives
   concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was
   restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout
   the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a
   broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including
   Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy
   Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods,
   economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of
   144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and
   quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were
   identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies
   relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical
   methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint
   application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability
   assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel
   approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information
   modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle
   methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing
   sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent
   outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the
   hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each
   method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be
   conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining
   these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures
   for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning
   sustainability assessment.},

Abstract = {Construction projects have numerous variable factors affecting the value
   of life cycle-cost (LCC) and there is interaction between these factors,
   leading to complicated process. Therefore the current LCC models suffer
   from the absence of a standardized and a simple methodology of both the
   collection data and estimation LCC. Identification of the significant
   cost factors affecting the output of LCC is important step before
   embarking upon the collection of progress information. Furthermore,
   components of construction differ in their cost and time-importance, and
   thus management effort must be equivalently distributed. The concept of
   cost significant items (CSIs) is the best method to simplify estimation
   methodology as well as the collection data of construction projects. In
   general, The CSIs concept aims to determine the small number of items
   which represent a constant percentage of the LCC of construction
   projects. Therefore, this paper aims to present the explanation of each
   stage of LCC, the current classifications of asset components, the CSIs
   concept and previous practice of the significant cost items on the
   construction sector.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and Product Carbon Footprints
   (PCFs) have a significant potential for contributing to
   consumption-based approaches to climate change. This paper provides an
   important building block towards a theoretical model of the factors
   accounting for variations in the availability of life cycle data across
   countries. It does so by positing a mechanism linking industry
   associations' institutional role within environmental policy processes
   to the availability of product life data and by empirically validating
   it. Methods Interviews, qualitative document analysis, web scraping,
   quantitative text analysis, set-theoretical causal reasoning, and
   process tracing. Results and discussion Environmental policies that
   stipulate industry-government deliberations and assign a coordinating or
   mediating role to industry peak associations can stimulate the exchange
   of environmental information among industrial sectors. The policy
   instruments of determination of `best available techniques' (BAT)
   towards standard setting, negotiated collective agreements and carbon
   pricing all contribute towards the institutionalisation of organised
   information exchange within industry. This lowers transaction costs for
   the monitoring, reporting and verification of sectoral environmental
   data and can thus be conducive to the creation of sectoral life cycle
   assessment data, with positive knock-on effects on the availability of
   firm- and product-specific LCA labels. Conclusions Industry
   associations' institutional role within environmental policy processes
   can partially explain cross-national variations in the availability of
   product life cycle inventories.},

Abstract = {Indian manufacturing industries are now more focused on the adoption of
   new business models over traditional business models to achieve
   sustainability in business practices. Now the industries are assessing
   their environmental impacts to promote sustainability and life cycle
   assessment applications. This study focused on the semi-structured
   interview with the Indian additive manufacturing experts from the
   Southern and northern region of India. The study was conducted on email
   interviews, in-depth phone calls and a multiple-choice questionnaire
   survey circulated through emails. The interviewees represented the
   different stakeholders in the Indian additive manufacturing industries
   with varying knowledge of life cycle assessment including the additive
   manufacturing product manufacturers, consultants for AM industries,
   research institutes and academia. The experts suggested that there is a
   need for good understanding the different factors in additive
   manufacturing industries which will help them to lower their carbon

Title = {Life cycle cost-based optimization framework for seismic design and
   target safety quantification of dual steel buildings with
   buckling-restrained braces},
Journal = {EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING \& STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 14},
Abstract = {This study proposes an efficient risk-targeted framework for integrated
   optimal seismic design and quantifying target safety of Special
   Moment-Resisting Frames (SMRFs) with Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRBs)
   in the typical dual steel buildings. This framework provides an
   automated design procedure formulated as a constrained single-objective
   optimization problem to achieve the minimum Life Cycle Cost (LCC) within
   the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and can be the basis of
   current seismic codes for target safety calibration. LCC includes
   initial construction cost and lifetime seismic losses such as repair
   cost, repair time, and casualties. FEMA P-58 methodology is employed for
   the LCC analysis of the building under possible earthquakes during its
   lifetime, which is able to take into account potential uncertainties in
   the hazard-response-damage-loss relationship. An appropriate cost model
   is developed to estimate the initial and repair cost of the studied
   BRBs. Minimum requirements of ASCE and AISC codes are considered as
   design constraints. Nonlinear response history analysis through the
   Endurance Time (ET) method is utilized to estimate the structural
   responses versus seismic intensity. Three 4-, 8-, and 12-story steel
   buildings with dual seismic force-resisting system consisting of SMRF
   and BRB (called steel SMRF-BRB) are selected as the case study. Each
   building is optimally designed with two approaches: (1) LCC-based design
   within the proposed framework and (2) code-based design to minimize
   initial construction cost. Comparison of optimized buildings with the
   two design approaches in terms of structural responses and seismic
   consequences demonstrates that fulfilling the minimum code requirements
   at a given seismic hazard level is not sufficient to minimize lifetime
   seismic losses of steel SMRF-BRBs. This is because the optimal designs
   obtained from the code-based approach are associated with damage
   concentration, irreparability, and high collapse probability, especially
   in seismic events more severe than the design level. The proposed
   LCC-based approach provides useful information for improving the
   lifetime seismic performance of steel SMRF-BRBs.},

Abstract = {Interest in intrinsically low-energy construction materials is becoming
   mainstream, and bio-based materials form a key part of that group of
   materials. The goal of this study was to analyse the environmental
   impact of applying a sol-gel coating on hemp shiv, in order to improve
   the durability of this innovative bio-based material, using a
   regionalised LCA model, taking into account regional specific
   peculiarities. This study analysed the environmental performance of
   using bio-based materials in the building envelope compared with
   traditional synthetic construction materials, and compared the impact of
   a regionalised approach with a global approach. The carbon footprint of
   treated hemp shiv in a wall with a U-value of 0.15 W/m(2).K was compared
   to untreated hempcrete and a reference cavity wall with the same
   U-value. Considering the environmental damage caused by the production
   of hemp shiv, nitrogen fertiliser was the hotspot. The LCA results
   showed that, using innovative bio-based materials in construction,
   treated hemp shiv with sol-gel can decrease the carbon footprint of a
   building envelope through carbon sequestration. Using the more accurate
   site-specific information in life cycle inventory and impact assessment
   methods will result in more consistent and site-appropriate
   environmental results for decision-making.},

Abstract = {The residential sector is one of the most significant energy consumers
   and therefore contributes significantly to climate change. A study of
   not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated
   consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to
   reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retro-fitting existing
   buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse
   gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For
   this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located
   in the city of Vitoria, in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The
   analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages.
   Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials
   that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed
   operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also
   verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical
   Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential
   Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance
   was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit
   measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building,
   namely, a 15\% reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of
   10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some
   international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in
   the operational stage of both buildings, in both labelling and energy
   consumption.},

Title = {Environmental performance of social housing in emerging economies: life
   cycle assessment of conventional and alternative construction methods in
   the Philippines},

Abstract = {The environmental impact of the social building stock is relevant,
   particularly in emerging economies. Life cycle thinking is not yet
   established, however. Locally available, alternative building concepts
   could potentially reduce the environmental impact of the construction
   segment. This paper examines the environmental performance of
   ``as-built{''} low-cost housing for an example of the Philippines, and
   the potential to reduce its environmental impact through use of three
   alternative building technologies: cement-bamboo frames, soil-cement
   blocks, and coconut board-based housing.
   Life cycle assessment models are implemented and evaluated with software
   SimaPro, using the single-impact indicators global warming potential
   (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) and the multi-impact indicator
   Impact2002+. According to EN 15978, the life cycle phase product and
   construction process (A), use stage (B), end-of-life (C) and
   supplementary information beyond the building life cycle (D) have been
   assessed. Theoretically calculated inflows from standard construction
   procedures used in phase A have been verified with 3 years of empirical
   data from implemented construction projects. For phases B, C and D,
   attention was given to service life, use-phase, allocation of waste
   products, biogenic carbon and land-use assumptions. Scenarios reflect
   the actual situation in the emerging economy. Processes, such as heat
   recovery from thermal utilization, which are not existing nor near to
   implementation, were excluded.
   For an assessment of the phases A-B-C-D with GWP, a 35\% reduction of
   environmental impact for soil-cement blocks, 74\% for cement-bamboo
   frame, and 83\% for coconut board-based houses is obtained relative to a
   concrete reference house. In absolute terms, this relates to a reduction
   of 4.4, 9.3, and 10.3 t CO2 equivalents over a service life of 25 years.
   CED showed higher impacts for the biogenic construction methods coconut
   board and cement-bamboo frames of +8.0 and +4.7\%, while the soil-cement
   technology was evaluated -7.1\% compared to GWP. Sixteen of 17 midpoint
   categories of Impact2002+ confirmed an overall reduction potential of
   the alternative building methods, with the midpoint category land
   occupation being the exception rating the conventional practice over the
   alternatives.
   It is concluded that the alternative construction technologies have
   substantial potential to reduce the environmental burden caused by the
   social housing sector. The service life of the alternative technologies
   plays a vital role for it. LCA for emerging economies needs to
   incorporate realistic scenarios applicable at their current state or
   belonging to the most probable alternatives to ensure valuable results.
   Recommendations for further research are provided.},

Title = {Life cycle inherent toxicity: a novel LCA-based algorithm for evaluating
   chemical synthesis pathways},
Journal = {GREEN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2016},

Pages = {3257-3264},

Abstract = {Green chemistry has long called for a life cycle approach in designing
   and assessing new syntheses. In evaluating hazardous chemical use, most
   green chemistry metrics only consider those chemicals directly
   associated with the synthesis and miss upstream hazards that can
   contribute to or even dominate overall impacts when evaluated using life
   cycle assessment (LCA). Conversely, LCA metrics are wholly dependent on
   emissions and do not capture potential risks posed by inherently
   hazardous chemicals. Life cycle inherent toxicity i{*} is a proposed
   novel metric that adapts the computational framework of LCA by attaching
   measures of inherent hazard to the intermediate chemical flows, rather
   than considering only emissions. Thus, it captures toxicity associated
   with the entire cradle-to-gate of a chemical, rather than just direct
   chemical inputs into a synthesis, and is a function of upstream use of
   hazardous chemicals, rather than only emissions. Values of i{*} are
   calculated for 181 organic chemicals from the ecoinvent LCI database.
   Statistical testing revealed no significant correlation between life
   cycle inherent toxicity and conventional toxicity, suggesting that the
   proposed metric provides novel information that can be used in
   conjunction with current green chemistry metrics. Outliers are
   investigated where the target chemical is much more toxic than its
   upstream building blocks (e.g., phosgene) and, conversely, where
   upstream chemical toxicity dominates (e.g., aniline). Values of i{*} are
   weakly correlated with values of conventional life cycle toxicity from
   the USEtox LCIA model, again suggesting that the new metric provides
   additional knowledge. A similar computational approach can be applied to
   examine other types of chemical hazards, such as corrosivity.},

Title = {Improving the Decision-Making for Sustainable Demolition Waste
   Management by Combining a Building Information Modelling-Based Life
   Cycle Sustainability Assessment Framework and Hybrid Multi-Criteria
   Decision-Aiding Approach},

Abstract = {Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition
   waste management (DWM) from a life cycle thinking perspective. To this
   end, facilitating sustainability-oriented decision-making for DWM
   planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing
   the trade-offs among multifaceted criteria. This study develops a
   BIM-based DWM sustainability assessment approach to facilitate the life
   cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) and decision-making by
   integrating LCSA-related properties and hybrid Multi-Criteria
   Decision-Aiding (MCDA) methods into a BIM environment using Dynamo
   visual scripting. A dynamic linkage is developed in the streamlined
   BIM-based LCSA process, where the enriched Industry Foundation Class
   (IFC) models are coupled with custom LCSA data templates to achieve
   seamless data exchange between the BIM platform and external LCA tools.
   Subsequently, hybrid MCDA methods convert the assessment results into
   DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study verifies the applicability of the
   BIM-based framework. The results unveil that the sustainability score
   ascended with the recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the
   highest recycling rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63.
   Conversely, a DWM alternative reflecting the `status quo' in China's
   recycling industry has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower
   than the baseline scenario with a 50\% recycling rate. It is worth
   noting that the `growth curve' of the sustainability score continuously
   flattens as the target recycling rate escalates. The increment in
   recycling rate from the ``Australian standard{''} scenario to the
   optimal scenario is 18.4\%, whereas the sustainability score merely
   increases by 2.3\%, implying that the former scenario arrived at an
   optimum point for maximising the cost-efficiency of DWM under the
   predefined settings.},

Abstract = {The fatigue safety assessment of critical details in steel bridges is
   dominated by several uncertainties mainly related to load modelling. The
   use of integrated weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems in roadway bridges
   allows to collect all the necessary information for tracking actual
   traffic conditions. Based on WIM data, the uncertainty associated to the
   evaluation of the probability of fatigue failure is reduced, allowing
   the optimal scheduling of repair and maintenance activities and thus
   improving safety and economic savings. The paper presents a methodology
   for estimating fatigue life cycle cost (LCC) of roadway bridges equipped
   with a WIM system that considers uncertainties in measurement and
   modelling errors. The procedure allows the quantification of the
   economic gain enabled by WIM systems, useful in assessing the
   cost/accuracy trade-off for a given WIM system. It is found that the
   continuous use of a WIM system may improve the rate of decrease of the
   structural reliability index, compared with temporally limited use of
   WIM data. The periodic update of the reliability index and of the
   probability of failure based on WIM measurements results in a rather
   accurate estimation of the fatigue life cycle cost, which is crucial in
   identifying the payback time of the WIM system.},

Abstract = {The life cycle environmental profile of energy-consuming products, such
   as air conditioning, is dominated by the products' use phase. Different
   user behavior patterns can therefore yield large differences in the
   results of a cradle-to-grave assessment. Although this variation and
   uncertainty is increasingly recognized, it remains often poorly
   characterized in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Today, pervasive
   sensing presents the opportunity to collect rich data sets and improve
   profiling of use-phase parameters, in turn facilitating quantification
   and reduction of this uncertainty in LCA. This study examined the case
   of energy use in building cooling systems, focusing on global warming
   potential (GWP) as the impact category. In Singapore, building cooling
   systems or air conditioning consumes up to 37\% of national electricity
   demand. Lack of consideration of variation in use-phase interaction
   leads to the oversized designs, wasted energy, and therefore reducible
   GWP. Using a high-resolution data set derived from sensor observations,
   energy use and behavior patterns of single-office occupants were
   characterized by probabilistic distributions. The interindividual
   variability and use-phase variables were propagated in a stochastic
   model for the life cycle of air-conditioning systems and simulated by
   way of Monte Carlo analysis. Analysis of the generated uncertainties
   identified plausible reductions in global warming impact through
   modifying user interaction. Designers concerned about the environmental
   profile of their products or systems need better representation of the
   underlying variability in use-phase data to evaluate the impact. This
   study suggests that data can be reliably provided and incorporated into
   the life cycle by proliferation of pervasive sensing, which can only
   continue to benefit future LCA.},

Title = {The Effects of Using a Trombe Wall Modified with a Phase Change
   Material, from the Perspective of a Building's Life Cycle},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {The increasing costs related to the use of primary energy carriers, and
   greater social awareness related to the need for energy saving,
   necessitate the use of renewable energy sources, including solar
   radiation. The Trombe wall (thermal storage wall-TSW) is an indirect
   passive solar energy system solution, aimed at obtaining, storing, and
   transferring thermal energy into buildings. However, there is no
   comprehensive information on the impact of the use of such solutions on
   environmental performance in the life cycle of buildings, especially
   those located in temperate climates. The aim of this paper is therefore
   to determine the environmental impact of the construction of barriers
   using phase change materials (PCM) from the perspective of the life
   cycle of a model building conforming to the current Polish energy
   standard (EP < 70 kWh/(m(2)center dot yr)). The subject of the research
   is the structure of a TSW using phase change materials and a reference
   wall with a maximum overall heat transfer coefficient of 0.2 W/m(2)K. A
   comprehensive computational model of a residential building located in
   Rzesz \& oacute;w, Poland, was created, taking into account the thermal
   parameters of the analyzed structure of the wall and its operation under
   real, specific climatic conditions, as well as the environmental
   characteristics. High-quality input data (based on real, long-term
   measurements) were used to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment of the
   analyzed variants. As a result, the energetic and environmental
   efficiency of the analyzed thermal storage wall, from the perspective of
   the whole building's life cycle, were assessed. According to the
   analyzed data, a TSW modified with paraffin enables the reduction of the
   energy requirements for heating by 11.3\%, and the payback period of the
   environmental load does not exceed 1 (GWP) and 5 (IMPACT2002+) years,
   which were lower than the monitored period of operation.},

Abstract = {Today, built facilities consume nearly 40\% of the global energy and
   produce about 30\% of CO2 emissions and solid waste. To decrease these
   rates, the evaluation, simulation and optimisation of energy efficiency
   of products for built facilities and facility components should be
   performed in various real-life scenarios before their actual use in
   practice. This paper presents a suggested Virtual Energy Laboratory
   where the involved multiple players can monitor the energy efficiency of
   a facility in all phases of the building life cycle by examining
   simultaneously various climatic, usage and design variations. To enable
   such simulation studies the Virtual Laboratory will provide for a huge
   number of parallel computations with varying simulation parameters from
   product data catalogues, climate data, user profiles and BIM model data
   using cloud technology. Moreover, it will also allow examining energy
   relevant product components like HVAC equipment or facade elements in
   different virtual building scenarios by simultaneously running
   simulations of the same component on different BIM data or climatic
   conditions. The paper describes the first steps of the Virtual
   Laboratory realisation including the developed principal software
   architecture and a first rapid prototype implementation. The presented
   work is done in the frames of the EU projects HESMOS (2010-13) and ISES
   (2011-2014).},

Title = {Developing a systematic framework for integrating life cycle carbon
   emission assessment in urban building energy modeling},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {260},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted in recent years on the
   environmental evaluation of building lifecycles, spanning construction,
   usage, and end-of-life phases. This holistic approach shows promise in
   assisting cities to achieve decarbonization goals, given the significant
   carbon emissions attributed to buildings in urban areas. Prior efforts
   have successfully utilized Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) tools
   to assess city-scale building energy consumption and explore energy
   efficiency scenarios. However, the integration of Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) with UBEM, a robust environmental assessment approach, remains
   underexplored. The combination of LCA and UBEM can provide a
   comprehensive understanding of a building's environmental impact,
   considering energy performance as well as broader considerations such as
   materials, construction processes, and waste management. Despite the
   evident benefits, there exists a research gap in fully harnessing the
   potential of integrating LCA and UBEM methodologies. Further
   investigation is thus warranted to unlock the synergies between these
   approaches, establishing an integrated framework that enhances
   sustainability assessments and informs decision-making in the built
   environment. A systematic approach is essential to address the
   challenges associated with the development of a city-scale environmental
   tool. This entails defining the challenges, identifying key components,
   establishing a structured framework, and testing and refining it through
   iterations. The defined framework should be implemented in modeling
   tools that offer a compatible environment. To address this need, this
   study proposes a systematic approach to the development of a framework
   for the integration of LCA into UBEM tools. Firstly, a structured
   procedure is defined to facilitate the systematic creation of the
   integrated framework. This procedure serves as a guide for developers to
   adopt a comprehensive and organized approach in addressing the
   challenges of combining LCA and UBEM methodologies. Subsequently, a
   workflow is designed to accommodate the implementation of any
   improvement practices within the defined systematic process of
   integrating LCA into UBEM tools. Applying the developed workflow in a
   real case study in Montreal, Canada, reveals that embodied carbon
   emissions can actually be higher than operational emissions, when the
   energy supply is renewable (hydropower). The outcomes of this research
   are expected to provide guidance for future studies on Urban Building
   Environmental Assessment (UBEA), facilitating a structured approach to
   advance and improve the field.},

Abstract = {Background, aim, and scope Today, the effective integration of life
   cycle thinking into existing business routines is argued to be the most
   critical step for more sustainable business models. The study tests the
   suitability of an input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) approach
   in screening life cycle impacts of energy-using products in companies.
   It estimates the life cycle impacts of three products and assesses the
   suitability of such approach in a company environment.
   Materials and methods The multiple case studies evaluate the suitability
   of an IO-LCA method in a company environment. A comprehensive life cycle
   cost and impact study of three product systems (building ventilation
   system, information and communication technology (ICT) network product,
   and welding machine) is conducted and the life cycle phases with highest
   economical and environmental contribution are determined. Scenario
   analysis is performed in order to assess the sensitivity of the results
   to major changes in the studied systems. Finally, the usability of the
   IO-LCA approach for environmental evaluations in companies is assessed
   by collecting data on workload and interviewing the participating
   workers and managers.
   Results The results showed that the use phase with operating energy was
   environmentally important in all evaluated energy-using products.
   However, only in one case (ICT network product) the use was the single
   most significant life cycle phase. In two other cases, the sourcing was
   equally important. The results also indicated that the IO-LCA approach
   is much easier to adapt by current management of companies because it
   automatically links life cycle costs to environmental indicators and, by
   order of magnitude, reduces the workload in companies.
   Discussion It appears that the IO-LCA approach can be used to screen
   environmentally significant life cycle phases of energy-using products
   in companies by utilizing readily available accounting or other
   documented data. The IO-LCA approach produced comparable results with
   the ones published in traditional process-based LCA literature. In
   addition to the main results, some practical benefits of using the
   IO-LCA could also be suggested: the approach was very fast to use and
   would thus allow an easier adoption of environmental evaluations in
   companies as well as wider environmental testing of products in early
   conceptual design phase.
   Conclusions The results indicated that the IO-LCA approach could clearly
   offer added value to the environmental management of companies. The
   IO-LCA was found to provide a very fast access to the key life cycle
   characteristics of products. Similarly, it offered practical means to
   integrate life cycle thinking into existing business routines and to
   activate the decision makers in companies by giving them easily
   comprehendible results.
   Recommendations and perspectives The results would suggest that similar
   environmental IO tables, besides the US ones used here, would have value
   and should be collected for other major geographical and economical
   regions. The tables would enable a much larger share of companies to
   manage their environmental issues. It also seems that, because the user
   profile is so dominant in the case of energy-using products, more
   studies, both theoretical (How to valuate the future behavior in
   environmental studies?) and empirical (What really creates value for
   users?), should focus on the behavior of users.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the major concerns worldwide and greenhouse gas
   emissions plays an important role in increasing the temperature of the
   earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, the construction industry is one of
   that presents a considerable environmental impact as it consumes large
   amounts of natural resources and energy. Aiming to investigate the
   environmental impacts, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology evaluates
   products and services showing the similarities and differences in
   evaluating midpoint and endpoint impact categories. This study reviews
   LCA from a building perspective and empowers the decision-making process
   and sustainable building design in the construction sector. The novelty
   is to estimate the operating energy performance and evaluate the
   endpoint impacts of building materials at an early designing stage,
   considering two methods of construction; concrete construction and steel
   construction. This work follows the methodological framework of LCA
   based on ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines within the available database,
   using Autodesk Green Building Studio application in Autodesk Revit and
   Open LCA software based on two assessment methods: IMPACT 2002+ and ILCD
   2011. A case study of a multi-story office building is applied to
   achieve the objectives of this work. The building is structured at four
   levels of subsystems and associated construction materials: basic
   structure, walls, finishing, and windows. Results indicate that using
   steel construction instead of concrete construction is more
   environmentally friendly in such types of buildings. It encourages the
   application of innovative techniques in the production process to
   protect natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and protecting the
   built environment.},

Abstract = {The UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative has been promoting the development
   and dissemination of a life cycle management capability maturity model
   (LCM CMM) to fully operationalize and eventually mainstream LCA into all
   facets of business, including product development, marketing, and
   strategic decision-making business processes. The capability framework
   defines a logical sequence of skill building based on the experiences of
   sustainability leaders that can speed learning for companies with less
   mature programs. Business improvement projects are designed to
   incrementally expand the span of concern from company objectives, to
   value chain viability, and ultimately to societal needs, while
   broadening the base of information and engaging a wider set of
   stakeholder views.
   The UNEP/SETAC sponsored pilot tests of the LCM CMM in Cameroon, Uganda,
   South Africa, India, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The results from the
   pilot conducted by Secretaria Distrital de Ambiente (SDA) and a network
   of 22 companies in Bogota, Colombia, are presented to illustrate how the
   capability approach can be applied and highlight lessons learned to
   promote further dissemination of life cycle practices.
   The companies were able to apply the concepts to develop accurate,
   representative assessments of organizational maturity and to identify
   reasonable improvement projects that delivered some financial value in
   the short term, addressed a management system gap identified in the
   maturity assessment, and could be completed within the schedule deadline
   of the contract (6 to 9 months). The projects included an LCA of
   cleaning products, collaboration among three companies to find a better
   solution for managing a waste stream of coffee ``silver skins,{''} a
   streamlined assessment of acrylic products, an LCA of disposable
   polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) cups, and a qualitative
   screening of operations of a transit company. The paper discusses how
   the results of the studies were used to identify specific improvement
   projects tailored to the specific needs and priorities of each company.
   The pilot projects showed that the capability maturity approach had
   intuitive appeal and the companies were able to apply the concepts to
   their organizations with limited technical support and identify an
   appropriate improvement project with LC relevance. This suggests there
   should be less emphasis on LCA as a tool to identify projects and more
   as a method to gain insights for effective implementation of
   business-relevant projects. One key question is how to sustain the
   energy and ongoing improvements fostered by this pilot program.},

Abstract = {In the last twenty years, the exploitation of non-renewable resources
   and the effects of their applications on environment and human health
   were considered central topics in political and scientific debate on
   European and worldwide scale. This kind of resources have been used in
   different sectors, as energy systems, technological research, but also
   in private/public buildings and production of consumer goods, involving
   significantly domestic and ordinary life of every human being. Studies
   about the effect of this exploitation carried out discouraging results,
   in terms of climate changes and energy sustenance; this determined a
   progressive approach process to a new concept of development, able to
   couple the qualitative standard of modern life with the respect of
   planet and its inhabitants. Starting from this reflection, scientific
   community moved towards research on alternative resources and developed
   a new way to conceive planning process and technical innovations, in
   order to exploit renewable energies and recycled materials, promote
   energy savings and reduce environmental pollution.
   In this context the present paper aims at evaluating benefits relating
   to different solutions of thermal insulation in building envelope. In
   fact a high grade of insulation ensures better comfort conditions in
   inner spaces, reducing energy consumptions due to heating and cooling
   conditioning. The paper presents the results of a detailed Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) of the reflective foil ISOLIVING, conceived and
   produced by an Italian company.
   The Life Cycle Assessment methodology allows to consider all stages of
   the life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to the product's
   disposal, in an optics ``from cradle to grave{''}. In particular, the
   study takes into account the production phase of the reflective foil
   ISOLIVING, the installation phase, the transport of all components to
   the production site and also the end of life scenario of the material.
   The possibility to collect many detailed information about the
   production phase adds value to the study.
   The analysis is carried out according to UNI EN ISO 14040 and UNI EN ISO
   14044, which regulate the LCA procedure. The LCA modeling was performed

Title = {Holistic Approach for Assessing Buildings' Environmental Impact and User
   Comfort from Early Design: A Method Combining Life Cycle Assessment,
   BIM, and Active House Protocol},

Abstract = {Due to our increasing dependence on resources and energy, climate change
   is among the most tangible issues we are facing today. The construction
   industry has been identified as a key sector to intervene in, but
   mitigation strategies must focus on more than just operational energy.
   As current climate policies recommend, designers should consider the
   broader framework of environmental impacts characterizing the entire
   building lifecycle. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considers the mentioned
   aspects. Nevertheless, the complexity of LCA and the criticalities of
   related tools prevent the application of the approach during decisive
   early stages. Additionally, LCA allows the estimation of environmental
   issues, but fails to describe other dimensions of sustainability. The
   article proposes an evaluation method to support decision-making during
   the design of sustainable buildings. The method exploits the LCA tool
   and the assessment framework provided by a Green Sustainable Building
   Certification (Active House) integrated with BIM. The approach was
   applied and proven through a case study: a residential single-family
   building in northern Italy, comparing two technological options. The
   study confirmed the effectiveness of the multicriteria evaluation
   framework that, from the early design stage, can be used to measure the
   environmental impact of buildings alongside implications for the final
   users' comfort.},

Title = {Overcoming challenges in life cycle assessment of smart energy systems -
   A map of solution approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Abstract = {Current research underlines the benefits of digitalization to integrate
   renewable energy sources (RES) efficiently and to coordinate generation
   and supply. This development towards smart energy systems (SES) includes
   emerging use cases at the distribution grid level, e.g., smart charging
   strategies for electric vehicles or energy management systems in
   buildings. An environmental assessment of such, however, is challenging.
   The standardized Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches seem
   insufficient since SES are emerging systems at the interface of
   digitalization and energy with multiple intended and unintended
   environmental effects. This article aims to derive solution approaches
   for LCA professionals that investigate use cases enabled by information
   and communication technology (ICT), specifically in SES. To identify
   challenges during the first two phases of an LCA and solution
   approaches, we examine seven recent research projects and conduct a
   real-time Delphi workshop with LCA experts in the field of SES. As a
   result, the article provides approaches on setting up an LCA, filling
   data gaps, and methods to draw upon the long-term impacts of use cases
   in SES. Key findings include a modified taxonomy of potential
   environmental effects. Results show that systemic effects in SES have
   potentially the highest impact on the LCA, followed by effects caused by
   user behavior. Assessing these effects of `higher-order' poses an
   increased complexity. Determined solution approaches include combining
   the standardized LCA with energy system modeling or surveys on user
   behavior. Overall, this article reveals orientation strategies and
   recommendations to guide LCA professionals toward a holistic
   environmental assessment of use cases in SES.},

Abstract = {The assessment of ecosystem services (ES) is covered in a fragmented
   manner by environmental decision support tools that provide information
   about the potential environmental impacts of supply chains and their
   products, such as the well-known Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   methodology. Within the flagship project of the Life Cycle Initiative
   (hosted by UN Environment), aiming at global guidance for life cycle
   impact assessment (LCIA) indicators, a dedicated subtask force was
   constituted to consolidate the evaluation of ES in LCA. As one of the
   outcomes of this subtask force, this paper describes the progress
   towards consensus building in the LCA domain concerning the assessment
   of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems and their associated services for
   human well-being. To this end, the traditional LCIA structure, which
   represents the cause-effect chain from stressor to impacts and damages,
   is re-tasted and expanded using the lens of the ES `cascade model'. This
   links changes in ecosystem structure and function to changes in human
   well-being, while LCIA links the effect of changes on ecosystems due to
   human impacts (e.g. land use change, eutrophication, freshwater
   depletion) to the increase or decrease in the quality and/or quantity of
   supplied ES. The proposed cascade modelling framework complements
   traditional LCIA with information about the externalities associated
   with the supply and demand of ES, for which the overall cost-benefit
   result might be either negative (i.e. detrimental impact on the ES
   provision) or positive (i.e. increase of ES provision). In so doing, the
   framework introduces into traditional LCIA the notion of ``benefit{''} (
   in the form of ES supply flows and ecosystems' capacity to generate
   services) which balances the quantified environmental intervention flows
   and related impacts (in the form of ES demands) that are typically
   considered in LCA. Recommendations are eventually provided to further
   address current gaps in the analysis of ES within the LCA methodology.

Abstract = {In the era of the great development of information technologies and
   telecommunications, a natural need to develop and implement a unified
   system of digital building information modelling has arisen. The rapid
   development of design technology in the field of architecture,
   engineering and construction leads to the continuous adaptation of the
   conceptual apparatus for building information modelling (BIM). BIM
   technology adopts a new definition as a universal tool for describing
   various elements of intelligent virtual 3D model of a building combining
   a series of sequential steps related to the investment, such as
   requirements of design, construction, operation and demolition
   optimizations and preparations. In the paper, the authors propose
   directions of research in the field of BLM (Building Lifecycle
   Management). (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {BIM-based life cycle environmental performance assessment of
   single-family houses: Renovation and reconstruction strategies for aging
   building stock in British Columbia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {The building sector accounts for 40\% of the energy use and one-third of
   the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Buildings deteriorate with
   age, which leads to a decrease in their energy performance. Therefore,
   it is significant to improve the energy performance of aging building
   block although it is challenging. The two main decision paths for
   municipalities are renovation and reconstruction. This study
   investigated the above options for the older housing stock in a densely
   populated urban centre in British Columbia, Canada. A scenario-based
   analysis approach was taken to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions of
   six different renovation and reconstruction scenarios. The total life
   cycle emissions were calculated for each scenario including the embodied
   and operational emission, and the emissions from building construction
   and maintenance. A BIM-LCA combined approach was used to assess the
   embodied GHG emissions with the SimaPro software. HOT2000 software was
   used to model the operational GHG emissions. The results show that in
   the reconstruction scenarios, around 40\% of the emissions are from the
   material manufacturing stage. The embodied emissions generated from the
   reconstruction scenarios are 5-6 times higher than the renovation
   scenarios. The life cycle GHG emissions of the existing house can be
   reduced by applying renovations, with the emissions saving gradually
   increasing with the level of retrofitting. The passive house
   reconstruction scenario delivers the greatest benefit in terms of life
   cycle emissions reduction compared to all other scenarios. In terms of
   the GHG emission intensity per unit area, the newly-built houses in
   scenarios 5 and 6 also have lower life cycle GHG emission per square
   meter than the renovated existing houses in scenario 1-4 after 15 and 10
   years to breakeven respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that
   when considering the older existing building stock, a careful weighing
   of options must take place before making the decision on replacing them
   with new construction. However, it is also important to consider the
   economic and social aspects before making decisions to renovate or
   replace existing houses. The study outcomes will support city planners
   and urban development planners to make decisions on BC aging building
   stock development, especially in high population density neighbourhoods.

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to provide a lifecycle building
   sustainability evaluation method to guide different stakeholders in how
   to apply sustainable practices and maintain the expected sustainability.
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) is selected to be a platform to
   integrate all the information to improve interoperability. Green
   standards are embedded in the BIM model and a rule-based system is
   developed to automatically evaluate the design and the building
   performance. Data are collected by using a Real-Time Location System
   (RTLS) and are used to update the BIM model. The as-built model is
   checked to see if it matches the sustainability aspects regarding the
   construction processes. During operation, energy consumption data are
   collected and analyzed. The performance of the building is checked to
   see if the designed features reach the sustainability goals. By
   integrating the BIM, RTLS, and other information, a prototype system of
   lifecycle sustainability evaluation is developed and tested.},

Title = {Sensitivity Analysis of Environmental Process Modeling in a Life Cycle
   Context: A Case Study of Hemp Crop Production},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a methodological approach allowing
   to assess the influence of parameters of one or more elementary
   processes in the foreground system, on the outcomes of a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) study. From this perspective, the method must be able
   to: (1) include foreground process modeling in order to avoid the
   assumption of proportionality between inventory data and reference
   flows; (2) quantify influences of foreground processes' parameters (and,
   possibly, interactions between parameters); and (3) identify trends
   (either increasing or decreasing) for each parameter on each indicator
   in order to determine the most favorable direction for parametric
   variation. These objectives can be reached by combining foreground
   system modeling, a set of two different sensitivity analysis methods
   (each one providing different and complementary information), and LCA.
   The proposed method is applied to a case study of hemp-based insulation
   materials for buildings. The present study will focus on the
   agricultural stage as a foreground system and as a first step
   encompassing the entire life cycle. A set of technological
   recommendations were identified for hemp farmers in order to reduce the
   crop's environmental impacts (from -11\% to -89\% according to the
   considered impact category). One of the main limitations of the approach
   is the need for a detailed model of the foreground process. Further, the
   method is, at present, rather time-consuming. However, it offers
   long-term advantages given that the higher level of model detail adds
   robustness to the LCA results.},

Abstract = {Phase change materials (PCMs) hold considerable promise for thermal
   energy storage and reduction of temperature swings in building space,
   and can reduce reliance on fossil fuel sources for both heating and
   cooling. Previous studies have evaluated the use of PCMs for energy
   storage and provided some limited information on the embodied energy of
   the PCM; however, an important factor that has not fully been addressed
   until now is the environmental impact of preparation of organic PCMs.
   This study presents life cycle assessments (LCAs) of two organic,
   biosourced PCMs for their applications, focusing on embodied energy and
   CO2 emissions.
   Dodecanoic acid produced from palm kernel oil was considered as a PCM
   for use in a solar thermal water heating application, and ethyl
   hexadecanoate produced from algae was considered for thermal buffering.
   The functional units were defined as 1 t of dodecanoic acid PCM and 1 kg
   of encapsulated ethyl hexadecanoate PCM, respectively. The LCA
   encompasses all phases in the PCM production: growth and harvesting of
   the feedstocks, extraction of the oil, treatment of the oil, and
   separation of singular components. The two PCMs were evaluated in terms
   of the payback times for their embodied energies and embodied CO2 under
   a modeled use phase.
   The energy payback time for dodecanoic acid in a solar thermal
   application was found to be less than 2 years. Although production of
   dodecanoic acid is a net CO2 emitter, use of this PCM in a solar thermal
   system can recoup the CO2 of production in less than a year. Ethyl
   hexadecanoate produced from algae, considered for use in a thermal
   buffering wallboard product, would require at least 30 years of use
   before its energy savings would match its embodied energy, mostly due to
   the drying step in the production of the PCM. However, ethyl
   hexadecanoate is a strong sequester of CO2 at 7.6 t per ton of ethyl
   hexadecanoate.
   Dodecanoic acid produced from palm kernel oil for use in a solar thermal
   hot water system appears to be a viable PCM. Its payback time, both for
   energy and carbon emissions, is under 3 years. On the other hand, the
   high embodied energy of ethyl hexadecanoate produced from algae gives a
   prohibitively long payback time for use in domestic thermal buffering
   applications.},

   systems: Formalism and framework for a modular approach},

Abstract = {The emphasis on the sustainable urban water management has increased
   over the last decades. In this context decision makers need tools to
   measure and improve the environmental performance of urban water systems
   (UWS) and their related scenarios. In this paper, we propose a versatile
   model, named WaLA (Water system Life cycle Assessment), which reduces
   the complexity of the UWS while ensuring a good representation of water
   issues and fulfilling life cycle assessment (LCA) requirements. Indeed,
   LCAs require building UWS models, which can be tedious if several
   scenarios are to be compared. The WaLA model is based on a framework
   that uses a ``generic component{''} representing alternately water
   technology units and water users, with their associated water flows, and
   the associated impacts due to water deprivation, emissions, operation
   and infrastructure. UWS scenarios can be built by inter-operating and
   connecting the technologies and users components in a modular and
   integrated way. The model calculates life cycle impacts at a monthly
   temporal resolution for a set of services provided to users, as defined
   by the scenario. It also provides the ratio of impacts to amount of
   services provided and useful information for UWS diagnosis or comparison
   of different scenarios. The model is implemented in a Matlab/Simulink
   interface thanks to object-oriented programming. The applicability of
   the model is demonstrated using a virtual case study based on available
   life cycle inventory data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study explored which envelope solutions in retail buildings led to
   cost-optimal levels considering the Energy Performance of Building
   Directive and Portuguese regulation. For such, energy simulations were
   run in BIM software based on the analysis of a case study in Portugal.
   Typical alternative solutions were tested against the original case
   study, and solutions with considerably lower U-value considering the
   code for commercial buildings (0,7 W/m2 degrees K for walls and 0,5
   W/m2.degrees K for roofs). To assess the cost-effectiveness of
   alternative envelope solutions, the Payback Period, the Net Present
   Value and the Internal Rate of Return at 15 years and 50 years were
   assessed. Results indicate that solutions with lower U-values are
   related to 2-5\% savings in energy consumption and can be cost-effective
   at 15 and 50 years, namely vacuum insulation panels of 2.5 cm and
   sandwich panels of 8-12 cm. This leads to the conclusion that lowering
   present code U-values can be cost-effective, but it will result in
   additional initial costs.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the desire to improve the sustainability of the
   construction industry, Sri Lanka is still plagued by the low-level
   adoption of essential methods such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in
   building and infrastructure delivery. It is indispensable to investigate
   enablers for facilitating LCA because identification of enablers is a
   crucial step in the implementation of LCA. This study aims to analyze
   internal and external enablers for facilitating LCA for the Sri Lankan
   construction industry from the perspective of five stakeholder
   categories (academia, government, construction industry, society and
   environmentalists) and also aims to develop strategies to strengthen the
   enablers. Design/methodology/approach An explanatory research design was
   used. The five stakeholder categories identified above, whose
   contribution is essential for implementing LCA in Sri Lanka, were
   selected for data collection. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews
   were held representing each stakeholder category. The Repertory Grid
   Interview (RGI) technique was utilized and data analysis was performed
   using content analysis. Findings The results revealed that ``ability to
   identify opportunities for environmental improvements as an extremely
   important internal enabler for all stakeholder categories{''} and ``the
   positive growth in the country to achieve environmental
   sustainability{''}, ``the availability of standardized LCA guides and
   handbooks{''} as extremely important external enablers for all
   stakeholder categories for facilitating LCA in the Sri Lankan
   construction industry. Further, strategies including making people aware
   of the LCA concept and development of the LCA database, etc. were
   proposed to strengthen the enablers. Practical implications Knowledge
   generated through this study would enable the abovementioned
   stakeholders to make informed decisions to promote the implementation of
   LCA in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further, the results of
   this study have raised awareness of the issues that Sri Lanka will need
   to solve to expand the LCA applications. Originality/value So far,
   research on LCA has not looked into enablers that can facilitate the
   implementation of LCA in the Sri Lankan construction industry. This
   research provides a comprehensive view of the internal and external
   enablers for facilitating LCA from the perspective of five stakeholder
   categories and identifies enablers that led the abovementioned
   stakeholders to pursue the implementation of LCA in the Sri Lankan
   construction industry. The study also proposes strategies for
   strengthening the enablers.},

Title = {Integrating G2G, C2C and resource flow analysis into life cycle
   assessment framework: A case of construction steel's resource loop},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {143-152},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to model
   life cycle impact of materials that integrates both Cradle-to-Grave
   (C2G) and Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C) approaches. The new approach, also
   known as the resource loop, has the capability to capture both C2G and
   C2C lifecycles of most products, processes or policies. The C2C LCA
   model represents the footprint of a product, process or policy that
   never ends (i.e., recycled or reused). It reflects the footprint of a
   product, process or policy that terminates at the end of its useful life
   (i.e., disposed or landfilled). In this paper, Material and Energy Flow
   Analysis (MEFA) is integrated into the C2C LCA model to enhance the
   model's capability to capture and integrate material and energy
   information internal and external of LCA. The flows are relabeled
   ``leaks{''} and ``feeds{''}, of which the material and energy could leak
   out of or feed into the life cycle system. The ``leaks{''} and
   ``feeds{''} reflect the flows of materials and energy in and out of the
   life cycle process. They can also be integrated with the life cycles of
   other product, process or policy. Such integration is a step closer
   toward a more comprehensive LCA model for a finished product that
   contains multiple material and energy flows (e.g., a building). Resource
   loop (RL) reflects the material and energy flows and loops of one or
   more complex systems more accurately. The RL incorporates leaks and
   feeds that reflect the reality of a product's lifecycle. Through data
   collected from selected sources, the paper illustrates the use of the
   construction steel RL. For every 1 kg of construction steel product made
   and disposed, 0.74 kg was found to remain in the loop through reuse or
   recycling. The remaining 0.26 kg ends up in landfills representing
   unrecoverable ``leaks{''}. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) can play an important role in
   providing insights for decision-makers regarding potential
   market-mediated resource/environmental consequences stemming from
   changes in product systems. However, the consistent application of CLCA
   encounters challenges due to the absence of common guidelines. This
   systematic review studied different sets of literature to develop a
   methodological framework for CLCA of plant protein extraction through
   fractionation, using Canada as an example. Given that economic models
   are integral components of CLCA, this systematic review offers a
   comprehensive survey of the economic models employed in 18 CLCA studies,
   shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses. Notably,
   the study identifies the use of both Computable General Equilibrium and
   Partial Equilibrium models for enabling the analysis of large-scale and
   long-term changes. The estimation of land use changes (both direct and
   indirect) is an integral part and economic models are instrumental in
   quantifying indirect land use changes. For characterizing the common
   modelling practices in the agri-food sector, 33 CLCA studies were
   reviewed to extract information on the decision context, time horizon,
   identification of marginal/substitutable markets, uncertainty and
   sensitivity analyses, etc. `Increased supply' and `increased demand' are
   both found to be important decision contexts. It is a common practice to
   identify marginal markets based on assumptions, literature, and other
   sources along with employing economic models for some cases. However,
   economic models in the agri-food studies were used more often for
   estimating land use change impacts. To elaborate the case study of plant
   protein extraction (i.e., pea fractionation), some of the alternative
   uses of the co-products of pea fractionation processes as a basis for
   determining probable marginal markets were identified. Building upon
   these findings, the review culminates in the proposal of a detailed
   methodological framework for CLCA applied to pea fractionation,
   incorporating considerations of marginal markets that revolve around
   utilizing co-products like pea starch and pea fibre. Future research
   could focus on identifying marginal markets relevant to the Canadian
   landscape, thereby enhancing the applicability and relevance of CLCA
   within this region.},

Abstract = {The battery-protective control strategy, vehicle-to-building (V2B)
   interactions, and economic policy regarding grid feed-in tariff are
   promising techniques for enhancing the lifecycle-based techno-economic
   performance. However, the current literature indicates limited progress
   in the techno-economic feasibility of positive building-vehicle systems,
   with considerations on battery cycling aging, degradation of hybrid
   renewable generations, and dynamic grid-responsive control strategy. In
   this study, an interactive building-vehicle system was mathematically
   formulated with multidirectional energy interaction paradigms, such as
   building-to-vehicle, grid-to-building, building-to-grid, and
   grid-to-vehicle. The roles of the V2B interaction levels, grid feed-in
   schemes, and energy management strategies in techno-economic
   performances were quantitatively characterised, from the perspectives of
   the net present value (NPV), discounted payback time (DPT), and net
   direct energy consumption. Novel energy management strategies were
   proposed for battery relative capacity improvement in response to the
   dynamic renewable-demand signal and grid information. Furthermore,
   uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed on the renewable
   system cost, battery cost, interest rate, and escalation rate of the
   electricity price. The results indicated that the ignorance of battery
   cycling aging results in an overestimation on NPV from 2.404 x 10(8)
   (0.310 x 10(8) US\$) to 3.005 x 10(8) HK\$ (0.388 x 10(8) US\$).
   Furthermore, compared to traditional rough estimation on battery aging
   (with the NPV at 2.446 x 10(8) HK\$ and the DPT at 4 years), the dynamic
   model in this study can provide more accurate and reliable battery
   relative capacity, together with conservative assessment on
   techno-economic feasibility (the NPV at 1.860 x 108 HK\$ (0.240 x 10(8)
   US\$) and the DPT at 5 years). In comparison with the grid feed-in
   tariff policies in most European countries, the implementation of the
   latest grid feed-in tariff in Hong Kong can increase the NPV from -7.633
   x 107 (-0.985 x 10(8) US\$) to 2.303 x 10(8) HK\$ (0.297 x 10(8) US\$)
   for the positive building-vehicle system. An interactive
   building-vehicle system was formulated, together with advanced
   management strategies for lifecycle-based techno-economic performance
   enhancement. Comparative analyses among scenarios with different control
   strategies, V2B interaction levels, and grid feed-in tariff schemes were
   performed to verify the reliability of the proposed technique for
   positive building-vehicle systems.},

Abstract = {Aligning the sustainability in construction process can be achieved
   through material selection process with low impact on environment and
   human health. Today, biocomposite materials are investigated and
   developed to replace with none, and less eco-friendly materials used in
   the construction industry leading to emergence of next generation of
   sustainable and green building materials. This paper aims to develop a
   model of fully hybrid bio-based biocomposite based on Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA), and comparing it with fully petroleum-based composite,
   which are common conventional building materials. The methodology
   framework of this research is determined based on ISO 14040 and 14044.
   Also, the ReCiPe as the common method in SimaPro software is chosen for
   appraising and comparing LC impact assessment (LCIA). This research
   highlights the negative effect of these kinds of building materials with
   providing single scores coming from three gauges including Human Health,
   Ecosystems and resources. It is observed that substituting the
   biocomposite with the fully petroleum based composite has led to a
   decline of about 30\% in single score outcome. The significance of this
   research is related to important judgement information to policy makers
   and the prospective manufacturers in the commercialization phase of this
   new biocomposites as sustainable and green building materials.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an innovative approach based on a
   virtual model, which allows to manage all the information about the
   building. This approach is applicable to all the phases of the building
   process, but many surveys show the lack of BIM implementation in the use
   e maintenance phases. The BIM use in the management phase represents a
   unexpressed potentiality, a differentiating factor compared to Product
   Lifecycle Management (PLM), a holistic approach able to oversee the
   whole life cycle of a product and the information connected with it,
   widespread and consolidated in the manufacturing sector. Starting from
   this assumptions, in an empirical study, the paper presents a
   qualitative investigation into the current situation of the processes
   management of the constructed heritage in a French real estate company.
   The case study proposes the integration of the PLM and BIM approaches,
   that could be defined as Building Lifecycle Management (BLM), in order
   to close the gap of the traditional method.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment based environmental impact estimation model for
   pre-stressed concrete beam bridge in the early design phase},

Abstract = {The late rise in global concern for environmental issues such as global
   warming and air pollution is accentuating the need for environmental
   assessments in the construction industry. Promptly evaluating the
   environmental loads of the various design alternatives during the early
   stages of a construction project and adopting the most environmentally
   sustainable candidate is therefore of large importance. Yet, research on
   the early evaluation of a construction project's environmental load in
   order to aid the decision making process is hitherto lacking. In light
   of this dilemma, this study proposes a model for estimating the
   environmental load by employing only the most basic information
   accessible during the early design phases of a project for the
   pre-stressed concrete (PSC) beam bridge, the most common bridge
   structure. Firstly, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the
   data from 99 bridges by integrating the bills of quantities (BOQ) with a
   life cycle inventory (LCI) database. The processed data was then
   utilized to construct a case based reasoning (CBR) model for estimating
   the environmental load. The accuracy of the estimation model was then
   validated using five test cases; the model's mean absolute error rates
   (MAER) for the total environmental load was calculated as 7.09\%. Such
   test results were shown to be superior compared to those obtained from a
   multiple-regression based model and a slab area base-unit analysis
   model. Henceforth application of this model during the early stages of a
   project is expected to highly complement environmentally friendly
   designs and construction by facilitating the swift evaluation of the
   environmental load from multiple standpoints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {As a disruptive information and communication technology (ICT) in the
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry,
   building information modeling (BIM) enables project teams to manage a
   project via a model-based cooperative approach. Although it has a
   widespread impact on the industry, the systematic implementation of BIM
   in projects faces challenges. This study integrated BIM into the
   lifecycle of a building project with the introduction of a conceptual
   framework constituted by BIM Information Flow, BIM Model Chain, BIM
   Workflow, BIM Institutional Environment, and BIM-based Project
   Management Information System (PMIS). This conceptual framework
   identifies the key areas for integrating BIM into the project lifecycle
   and explains how BIM works for project management practice. Through an
   ethnographic action research approach, the study developed a BIM roadmap
   for the project lifecycle by systematically implementing BIM in the
   building project. The major findings and pieces of evidence derived via
   the implementation support the conceptual framework. The following
   discussions explain how BIM disrupts the project from the view of
   organization design and clarify the contributions of this study in
   project management, as well as BIM adoption and integration. Finally,
   the conclusions focus on the development of this research, the role of
   the conceptual framework to underlie the BIM roadmap, and the research
   limitations. Recommendations are provided toward future research works.},

Title = {An integrated optimization and sensitivity analysis approach to support
   the life cycle energy trade-off in building design},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},

Abstract = {The building design process plays a central role in efforts to implement
   energy-efficient practices. However, unilateral design choices based
   solely on reducing operational energy use can significantly increase a
   building's embodied energy and life cycle energy use as there is a
   trade-off between embodied and operational energy. To support such
   trade-off problems, multi-objective optimization represents a useful
   approach that produces a set of optimal solutions from where a solution
   can then be selected and progressed within the design process. Selecting
   one solution from the set of optimal solutions can however be a
   challenging task as each solution has the potential to be chosen as the
   optimum. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore how
   solutions from a multi-objective optimization approach can be analyzed
   further to provide information to decision-makers when selecting the
   optimal design solution. An approach is proposed where the integration
   of post-optimization sensitivity analysis into a multi-objective
   optimization approach aims to support decision-makers in analyzing the
   optimal solutions provided by the optimization process. The
   applicability of approach is demonstrated using a case of a multifamily
   apartment building located in Sweden, where the aforementioned trade-off
   is explored for a set of energy efficiency measures. Thereby, a diverse
   range of optimal solutions that could result in up to 4520 GJ life cycle
   energy (LCE) savings relative to the case building's initial design was
   ini-tially identified using the multi-objective optimization. These
   solutions were then subjected to a sensi-tivity analysis where the
   results indicated that in general the lowest and highest sensitivity in
   terms of LCE use belonged to the insulation thicknesses in roof and
   walls, respectively. Furthermore, the thick-ness of exterior floor
   insulation yielded the greatest variation in the sensitivity. The
   findings of case study indicate that the post-optimization sensitivity
   analysis can add valuable information that complements the results
   obtained using a multi-objective optimization approach. Consequently, it
   can support decision-making on how to progress with the design in terms
   of what design parameters have a negligi-ble or significant impact on
   the objectives when they are varied, thus facilitating prioritization.

Title = {Deciphering Building Information Modeling Evolution: A Comprehensive
   Scientometric Analysis across Lifecycle Stages},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has catalyzed transformative shifts
   across various industries, which has sparked broader research interests
   in the BIM lifecycle. However, studies that specify the stated
   requirements for different technologies and methodologies from the
   perspective of the BIM lifecycle and analyze research hotspots and
   future research trends at each stage are scarce. Employing scientometric
   theories and methods, this study conducts an in-depth comparative
   analysis of BIM lifecycle stages. The analysis encompasses several
   aspects like annual research output and knowledge flows, in the aim of
   unveiling disparities in the technological requirements, defining
   research boundaries, and illuminating lifecycle research trends.
   Findings indicate an ongoing surge in research across all BIM lifecycle
   stages with technologies like digital twins and artificial intelligence
   becoming prevailing trends. The cooperative design of BIM components,
   virtual-real world coordination, interactions among buildings,
   individuals, and environments, as well as the in-depth integration of
   BIM with the multifaceted fields of urban management have emerged as
   focal points in the planning, construction, management, and maintenance
   of BIM, respectively. Future BIM lifecycle research will necessitate
   interdisciplinary collaboration, emphasizing technological integration,
   common data environment (CDE) information sharing, open-source
   BIM/historic building information modeling (HBIM) system, and impactful
   exploration in areas like urban construction and historical
   preservation.},

Abstract = {The market of Adaptive Building Skins has been growing at a slow but
   incremental speed, as these technologies ensure better indoor climatic
   comfort and more efficient energy management than traditional solutions.
   Nonetheless, if we acknowledge the building as a system of physical
   qualities oriented to overall environmental performance, the resource
   optimization has to be extended to considering a wider range of
   environmental impacts along the entire building life cycle. For this
   purpose, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method is recognized by
   stakeholders as the most world-renowned standardized tool for weighting
   environmental impacts. The aim of this study is to scrutinize the state
   of the art of LCA among stakeholders enrolled in the design and
   manufacturing of building and adaptive facades in the Italian market.
   Data have been collected throughout interviews and an online survey
   focusing on investigating the knowledge and experience level of
   participants. Results not only draw the attention to develop new market
   models by implementing sustainable building protocols concerning
   adaptive technologies, but also provided a positive assessment on the
   usability degree of a parametric design mapping based on a systemic and
   life-cycle-oriented approach to achieve environmental scopes and
   introduce competitive factors and boost innovation in the Italian
   building industry.},

Title = {Moving automated compliance checking to the operational phase of the
   building life-cycle: analysis and feasibility study in the UK},

Abstract = {Construction regulations ensure a base level of safety of built assets.
   Formal checking of built assets against regulations happens at defined
   points in their life-cycle, and often there is limited automation
   involved. The movement towards digitising and automation elements of
   physical site inspections paves the way towards a whole life-cycle
   approach for compliance checking. This paper explores whole life-cycle
   compliance checking. It does this by extending current checking
   processes which are common in the design and construction phases into
   the operational phase of the building life-cycle, proposing that the
   best way to achieve this is through automated/semi-automated data
   capture and analysis. To test the feasibility of this concept, this
   paper will review existing academic literature, analyse existing
   regulations and conduct proof of concept testing. This paper has found
   that the concept of whole-lifecycle compliance checking is becoming
   increasingly important to better monitor and assure high risks elements
   of the built environment. When applied to the operational phase, it,
   however, becomes impractical and expensive when relying on solely manual
   inspections. Furthermore, there is a significant quantity of viable use
   cases for this approach and that there are viable technologies to
   leverage them.},

Abstract = {The concept of a successful building project should be implemented
   across the project's lifecycle phases to obtain maximum profits without
   compromising the standard. Although BIM implementation in developing
   countries is limited, much research has focused on BIM drivers. However,
   there is less evidence to thoroughly investigate the influence of BIM
   barriers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study addresses
   barriers to BIM implementation in building projects in developing
   countries. It investigates the influence of BIM barriers on awareness of
   BIM during the project lifecycle. Thus, a comprehensive literature
   review is required to build a conceptual model. Subsequently, the
   Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was
   developed using a questionnaire survey tool. Data were collected from 90
   building experts in Nigeria. The model's outputs highlighted that cost
   and standards, process and economic, technology and business, and
   training and people are the most critical barriers to BIM implementation
   that should be avoided. Furthermore, the model prediction revealed that
   eliminating BIM barriers has a minor impact on sufficient knowledge
   throughout the building project lifecycle. The findings provide the
   basis for policy making in developing countries concerning the
   successful completion of projects by avoiding BIM barriers; it will
   likewise enhance the success of building projects through BIM.},

Abstract = {The adoption of digital technologies in the construction sector is seen
   by many as a catalyst for the ecological transition, through the
   optimization of resource and energy use. However, the environmental
   impact of the digital infrastructure supporting projects is not well
   known. In the example of life cycle management of linear
   infrastructures, the increased use of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors
   for maintenance/operation has been followed by a diversification of
   technologies for Building InformationModeling (BIM), Building Life cycle
   Management (BLM), equipment and exchange formats. The variety of
   computer terminals, hardware storage and communication equipment are
   extended by that of software tools and free or proprietary solutions.
   The main objective of this paper is to establish a methodology based on
   environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental
   impacts of a digital service in Infrastructure LifecycleManagement
   (ILM). Relying on a case study of a bridge monitoring system implemented
   for the A71 near Orleans, France, we propose to model the assessed
   system as four interacting sub-systems: data acquisition, network and
   communication, consultation, and data storage. Based on such modelling
   and related data, a preliminary assessment highlights the contribution
   of data storage in the environmental impacts of the overall system.},

Title = {Techno economic and life cycle assessment of olefin production through
   CO2 hydrogenation within the power-to-X concept},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {469},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The paper deals with exhaustive process modelling, techno-economic and
   life cycle assessment (TEA/LCA) of olefin (ethylene and propylene)
   production through captured CO2 and electrolytic hydrogen. Olefins are
   important building block chemicals with several applications and carbon
   capture and utilisation (CCU) can provide a sustainable production
   route. The proposed system involves direct air capture (DAC) of CO2;
   proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis for hydrogen
   production, methanol synthesis, methanol to olefins (MTO) upgrade, and
   power generation from off-shore wind turbines. This study proposes a new
   integrated process as the first attempt to holistically assess a whole
   CCU assembly aiming at olefins production. Processing modelling has been
   implemented using the Aspen plus V12.1 and MATLAB R2022a software to
   solve the mass and energy balances of each unit operation. The modelling
   results showed a carbon efficiency of 72.3\% to ethylene and propylene.
   In addition, the process is designed and integrated in such a way that
   no external heat supply is required. A specific energy consumption (SEC)
   of 150 MJ/kg olefins (41 kWh/kg) has been estimated. A minimum selling
   price of 3.67 pound per kg of olefins is required for the proposed
   process to break-even. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the
   major cost driver is the cost of electricity. In addition, the life
   cycle assessment (LCA) has exposed that the proposed synthesis route of
   olefins has the potential to reduce the global warming potential (GWP)
   by 47\% compared to fossil- based production. The outcomes of this study
   can be beneficial to engineering conceptual studies, policy makers and
   contribute new information to the CCU academic community.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technique in the
   construction industry. It is regarded as an effective approach for green
   building development; however, its effectiveness has not been
   sufficiently investigated from a lifecycle perspective. To bridge this
   research gap, this study investigates BIM application value in different
   phases of a green building through a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   method. To begin with, an assessment framework was developed with the
   consideration of balancing the estimation accuracy and the data size.
   Then, the validity of the developed model was verified from both
   theoretical and practical perspectives. Finally, the effectiveness of
   BIM was tested using the proposed framework. Results showed that the
   overall score of the tested project was four in the five-point Likert
   scale, with an average relative error less than 1\%. From a value-based
   perspective, it is revealed that the application value of BIM
   represented a descending order throughout the lifecycle of the tested
   project. In addition, it is found that the functional value obtained the
   highest score, whereas social value was at the bottom. The findings of
   this study can help decision makers to detect the weaknesses of BIM
   implementation during green building development.},

Title = {Towards fully BIM-enabled building automation and robotics: A
   perspective of lifecycle information flow},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has seen
   a continuous growth in the application of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) over the last two decades while building automation and robotics
   is also gaining ground in the meantime. With more joint applications of
   both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for
   robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be
   fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper
   presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative
   analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building
   automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in
   Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior
   knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics
   in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and
   feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of
   lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three
   typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing,
   assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the
   potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally,
   a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed
   to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR
   framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are
   discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. (C) 2021

   Efficient Building Lifecycle},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Energy Efficient Building (EEB) design, construction, and operations
   require the development and sharing of building information among
   different individuals, organizations, and computer applications. The
   Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) web service is a solution to enable an effective exchange of data.
   This paper presents an investigation into the core RESTful web service
   requirements needed to effectively support the EEB project lifecycle.
   The requirements include information exchange requirements, distributed
   collaboration requirements, internal data storage requirements, and
   partial model query requirements. We also propose a RESTful web service
   design model on different abstraction layers to enhance the BIM
   lifecycle in energy efficient building design. We have implemented a
   RESTful Application Program Interface (API) prototype on a mock
   BIMserver to demonstrate our idea. We evaluate our design by conducting
   a user study based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results
   show that our design can enhance the efficiency of data exchange in EEB
   design scenarios.},

Abstract = {The stages of pre-project preparation and design development are the
   fundamentals to the further implementation of an investment and
   construction project. The success of construction and commissioning of
   facilities depends on the smooth completion of these stages. The
   duration of stages depends on the competence and coordination of
   interaction between participants of an investment and construction
   project, rational decision making by the project manager and a number of
   other factors. Identifying these factors and finding rational planning
   options in terms of the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development is a highly relevant task. With this in mind, the authors
   have developed an organizational and management model of a rational
   procedure to be implemented by the project manager at the stages of
   pre-project preparation and design development for a facility to be
   constructed. The model takes into account the influence of negative
   factors. The authors have also developed a method for selecting rational
   solutions at the stages in question. The analysis of the research
   literature and regulatory documents was performed for this purpose. The
   method of expert evaluations, elements of numerical analysis,
   mathematical processing of practical results and methods of mathematical
   modeling were applied. As a result, the authors have developed an
   organizational and management model for a rational combination of
   procedures at the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development for a facility to be constructed and derived a formula
   determining the duration of implementation of each stage and a technique
   designated for selecting rational solutions at the stages in question.
   The findings of this study can simplify project planning and process
   management at the stages of pre-project preparation and design
   development in terms of information modeling.},

Abstract = {Purpose The built environment is taking enormous leaps towards its
   digitalization. Computer-aided tools such as building information
   modeling (BIM) are found in the forefront of this evolution, playing a
   critical role in creating the foundations for the upcoming development
   of smart low-carbon cities. However, the potential of BIM is still
   untapped - links will need to be created among the available and
   forthcoming methodologies under one integral operational system. The
   purpose of this paper is to present an integrated BIM-based life
   cycle-oriented framework for achieving sustainable constructions at the
   pre-construction phase. The developed framework represents an example of
   the approaches that the construction industry will need to adopt to
   integrate the different tools under an integrated smart city context.
   Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach follows the
   development of four same-volume different-configuration
   three-dimensional BIM designs, which are coupled with life cycle
   assessment (LCA) tools for establishing sustainable building design.
   Findings The results of this paper indicated that the choice of building
   design and shape can play a significant role in reducing the embodied
   energy and embodied carbon of buildings, achieving a reduction of up to
   15\% compared to a reference building of same volume and gross floor
   area. Originality/value The originality of this paper is found in its
   approach application by coupling three-dimensional BIM models with LCA
   data, the use of reinforcement detailing in an nD BIM study and the
   employment of country-specific LCA databases.},

Title = {Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimal lifecycle
   management of complex structures},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A fundamental issue in the development and engineering industries is the
   efficient management of complex structures during their entire
   lifecycles. Traditional fragmented techniques have been used, and this
   has led to instances of poor communication and subpar performance,
   particularly in the context of repair and restoration initiatives.
   Building information modeling (BIM) emerged as a ground-breaking
   strategy that offers a digital representation of a building's attributes
   and facilitates effective collaboration among several stakeholders. The
   current study examines how BIM impacts complex building management
   throughout the course of a structure's existence. It focuses on how BIM
   helps to advance maintenance procedures, environmental initiatives, and
   project effectiveness. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), structural
   equation modeling (SEM), and literature research are the three phases of
   the study's methodology. A thorough investigation was carried out in
   Pakistan's Rawalpindi and Islamabad region utilizing a quantitative
   technique. The poll of 159 participants produced intriguing findings.
   The process of EFA serves to verify constructs and questions, ensuring
   their reliability and validity. On the other hand, SEM is used to assess
   the structural relationships between variables and their impact on BIM
   based lifecycle management. The findings suggest that the application of
   BIM is favorably influenced by each phase of a project, namely Design,
   Construction, Operation and Maintenance, Renovation and Retrofitting,
   and End-of-Life Decisions. This highlights the need to implement a
   complete BIM strategy across all stages of a project's lifespan, which
   may enhance facility management, decrease expenses, and promote
   sustainability. The results of this study have significant consequences
   for professionals and politicians, highlighting the crucial need to
   provide incentives and regulations to promote the use of BIM in building
   projects.},

Abstract = {The growing application of the BIM (Building Information Modelling)
   methodology shows that the BIM (Building Information Model) needs some
   agreed limitations in its universe of discourse in order to remain
   manageable and to solve the interoperability with other worlds, like the
   Building Automation System (BAS) modelling. The fast developing domain
   of energy-efficient design and operation of buildings has put strong
   pressure on such developments because the vast quantity of information
   and data models not originally belonging to the AEC/FM domain need to be
   made interoperable with the BIM model. We propose an interoperability
   method based on description logic ontology whose core is provided by a
   Link Model containing rules and constraints, not only to connect
   dynamically any kind of models, but also to allow sound quality control
   of the links by supporting knowledge-based management methods protecting
   the end-user from possible errors by the exponentially growing possible
   links with the increase of the level of needed detail.},

Title = {Optimization and BIM-based lifecycle assessment integration for energy
   efficiency retrofit of buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {A retrofit plan for improving the energy efficiency of an existing
   building can contribute to a sustainable built environment. This study
   presents a novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization,
   6D-Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Life Cycle Assessment to
   enhance existing buildings' energy efficiency through applying energy
   retrofit measures. This framework aims to (1) integrate life cycle cost,
   and environmental impacts analysis (2) identify energy-efficient
   alternatives for buildings' energy retrofit (3) make the decision-making
   process straightforward for decision-makers and investors (4) discover
   the primary energy efficiency agents that impose the most energy waste
   on existing buildings. This study contributes to the body of knowledge
   by applying effective retrofit measures and alternative material choice
   and empowers decision-making by analyzing life cycle cost and
   environmental impacts of building envelopes by combining mathematical
   optimization, BIM, and LCA. The BIM energy model compares the cooling
   and heating loads of the building's components before and after applying
   retrofitting measures. The results show that inefficient buildings'
   envelopes and evaporative coolers play a significant role in energy
   consumption. A developed mathematical optimization model estimates the
   economic benefits of energy efficiency upgrades to minimize the total
   life cycle cost of a building during its lifetime. Moreover, it provides
   an optimum energy retrofitting scenario that leads to reductions of
   24\%-58.2\% in energy consumption. In conclusion, the Life Cycle
   Assessment Comparison between the building before and after retrofitted
   measures demonstrates that over 45\% of global warming impacts could be
   reduced in the well-established building.},

   wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system},

Abstract = {Building clean and modern multi-energy complementary systems is a direct
   path to decarbonization in energy sector. The introduction of hydrogen
   energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy
   complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key
   issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen
   multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to
   finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system,
   consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process,
   and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the
   planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the
   following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation
   based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on
   probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration
   optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes
   the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective.
   The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization
   from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the
   system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon
   emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained
   only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional
   distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in
   this study decreased by 82.75 \%. In addition, considering that the
   system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can
   reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 \% but only increase costs by
   about 29.4 \%. The computational results justify the proposed
   optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the
   system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference
   for practice.},

Abstract = {Photovoltaic system is a technology for the production of electricity
   from renewable sources that is rapidly expanding thanks to its
   capability to reduce the energy consumption from traditional sources and
   to decrease the air pollution. During the operational phase, there are
   no emissions and the only input is represented by solar power. However,
   it should be noted that, considering the entire life cycle of a plant,
   photovoltaic systems, like any other means of electricity production,
   give rise to emissions, that focus especially in the manufacturing stage
   and installation of components.
   The present work aims at evaluating the environmental impact, and
   therefore the actual sustainability of this technology, examining a
   ground-mounted 1778.48 kW(p) photovoltaic plant, realized by
   TerniEnergia S.p.A. and located in Marsciano (Perugia, Italy). The
   analysis is conducted using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA), which allows to consider all stages of the life cycle, from the
   extraction of raw materials to the plant's disposal ({''}from a cradle
   to grave perspective{''}). In particular, the study takes into account
   the soil preparation, the installation of fence and electrical
   substations of low and medium voltage, the mounting of support
   structures, also with reference to hot dip galvanizing process, the
   production of modules, their installation, the wiring apparatus and the
   network connection. The transport of all components to the installation
   site is considered for each stage that is examined. The end of life
   scenario of the plant is also evaluated. The possibility to collect many
   detailed information in the construction site, during the building
   phase, adds value to the study. The analysis is carried out according to
   UNI EN ISO 14040 and UNI EN ISO 14044, which regulate the LCA procedure.
   The LCA modelling was performed using SimaPro software application and
   using Eco Indicator 99 methodology. The results of the analysis allows
   to calculate some important parameters like EPBT (Energy Pay-Back Time),
   EROEI (Energy Return on Energy Invested), CO2 emissions and GWP100
   (Global Warming Potential). Finally, the environmental impact of
   photovoltaic plant is compared to that of some traditional energy
   production systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Conceptual Framework of Information Flow Synchronization Throughout the
   Building Lifecycle},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction industry's reliance on traditional methods and
   fragmented workflows results in significant information loss,
   inefficiencies, increased costs, and errors. This study addresses these
   issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building
   information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow
   throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that
   synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national
   and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and
   analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a
   conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and
   interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting
   open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for
   effective information exchange. By implementing an information model
   (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit
   processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory
   compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated
   information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction
   practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research
   illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize
   the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and
   fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust
   framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency
   and accuracy of construction processes.},

Abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) to support
   various tasks of building lifecycle management (BLM) has been reported
   in a range of studies. However, during its lifetime, a building is an
   important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must
   not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its
   participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what
   way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its
   surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been
   reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building
   lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a
   building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however
   potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet
   been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of
   application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM
   processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings,
   site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby
   facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical
   framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM
   and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all
   stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable
   decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management
   of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established
   that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated
   solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective. (c) 2021 American

Title = {Modelling the Impact of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   Implementation Drivers and Awareness on Project Lifecycle},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO)
   industry is generally slow in adopting emerging technologies, and such
   hesitance invariably restricts performance improvements. A plethora of
   studies have focused on the barriers, Critical Success Factors (CSFs),
   lifecycle and drivers independently, but none have explored the impact
   of BIM drivers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study
   empirically explored the impact of BIM drivers and awareness on the
   project lifecycle using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Initially,
   a conceptual model was developed from an extensive literature review.
   Thereafter, the model was tested using primary questionnaire data
   obtained from 90 construction professionals in Lagos, Nigeria. Emergent
   findings indicate that Building Information Modelling (BIM) drivers have
   a high impact on BIM awareness at the operation stage of the project
   lifecycle. The SEM model has an average R-2 value of 23\% which is
   moderate. Consequently, this research contributes to the existing body
   of knowledge by providing invaluable insight into the impact of BIM
   drivers on BIM awareness in the project lifecycle. Knowledge acquired
   will help industry stakeholders and government to develop appropriate
   policies to increase BIM uptake within contemporary practice.},

Title = {The Role of Embodied Carbon Databases in the Accuracy of Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) Calculations for the Embodied Carbon of Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Studies conducted by major national and international scientific bodies
   have indisputably concluded that the increase in anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) since the mid-20th century has led to
   irreversible changes in the climate. Data has shown that the
   contribution of the building sector accounts for 39\% of these
   emissions. Reducing GHG emissions associated with the construction phase
   of buildings, or embodied carbon (EC), will prevent GHG emissions from
   entering the atmosphere earlier, reducing the negative impacts. However,
   to achieve any meaningful reduction, there is a need for consistency and
   accuracy in the calculations. The accuracy of these calculations is
   primarily tied to the accuracy of embodied carbon factors (ECF) used in
   the calculations, values determining the environmental impact of a
   product or procedure per unit weight. The emissions of any product can
   be calculated by performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). While the
   requirements for carrying out an LCA have been standardised in ISO14044,
   the lack of a definitive national ECF database in the UK means that EC
   calculations can vary drastically based on the chosen database. An LCA
   has been carried out on a standard Lidl supermarket design within the
   A1-A3 boundary. For the calculation, the ECFs were sourced from two
   different databases, using the GHG conversion factor data published in
   2020 by the UK Department of Energy \& Climate Change and data published
   in 2019 by the Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE). The latter is
   currently accepted as the most consistent database for carbon factors in
   the UK. This study showed that using a more detailed database compared
   to using a more general database could result in a 35.2\% reduction of
   embodied carbon, while using more detailed data from a single database
   can reduce it by a further 5.5\%. It is necessary to establish the most
   accurate baseline for embodied carbon so that any carbon reduction
   attempts can be as effective as possible.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the opportunities of using digital building
   platforms based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) to increase
   occupational health and safety (OHS) in building design, construction,
   operation and deconstruction. The data collection followed a
   mixed-method approach with a systematic mapping review and focus group
   discussions with industry practitioners from the Swedish construction
   and real estate industry. Use cases were identified from both venues, as

Abstract = {Residential building construction is resource-intensive and
   significantly impacts the environment by embodied and operational carbon
   emissions. This study has adopted a parametric building information
   modelling (BIM)-based approach for a residential building to analyse its
   lifecycle carbon performance and to evaluate the optimisation potential
   through alternative material use and design. The study looks at a
   residential development project, applying an automatic calculation and
   analysis tool of upfront embodied carbon and BIM-based lifecycle energy
   simulation to predict carbon emissions from operating the built spaces.
   A parametric BIM model has been established to aid energy simulation and
   operational carbon assessment across a 50-year building lifetime,
   considering 1.5 degrees C Net-Zero World and 3 degrees C Hot House World
   climate scenarios. Various improvement opportunities for future
   residential development projects, from material selection to operational
   efficiencies, are explored. This includes quantitative analysis on
   architectural-structure design, low-carbon construction materials (e.g.,
   cement substitutes, steel scraps, and green hydrogen steel), and novel
   design for construction approaches (such as modular integrated
   construction), with discussion around their impacts on optimising the
   building lifecycle carbon performance. This study provides a deeper
   understanding and insights into the lifecycle performance of residential
   buildings to facilitate further exploration of achieving a more
   sustainable and low-carbon built environment.},

Abstract = {To achieve the UK's net-zero carbon transition by 2050, new homes need
   to be designed to high energy efficiency standards and minimise life
   cycle carbon emissions. This study develops a method that integrates
   building energy modelling (BEM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools,
   IES Virtual Environment (IES VE) and One Click LCA, to conduct a life
   cycle assessment of the operational and embodied carbon impacts of a
   typical terraced building shell in an eco self-build community housing
   (ESBC) project, using Water Lilies as a case study. It evaluates and
   compares the 60-year life cycle carbon impacts of six design options
   that apply different insulation materials to the case study building
   shell. The results are based on grid-connected Future Energy Scenarios
   (FES) that have different carbon intensities predicted over time and the
   microgrid-connected Water Lilies Community Energy (WLCE) scenario that
   is operationally net-zero carbon. Depending on the FES, embodied carbon
   accounted between 59 and 80\% of total emissions compared to 20-41\%
   from operational carbon across design options. The results show that
   operational carbon is highly sensitive to the percentage of renewables
   in the energy mix of the grid, which is difficult to predict, and can
   significantly influence the design choice. As such, future researchers
   should account for predicted changes to the carbon intensity of the grid
   by applying a similar method to that proposed. Overall, the integration
   of IES VE and One Click LCA provided a more streamlined life cycle
   assessment to help inform early design decisions by enabling energy
   consumption simulation in BEM to assess operational carbon emissions and
   the automated transfer of building materials from the BEM model to the
   LCA tool to assess embodied carbon emissions. The limitations included
   the unavailability of material-specific data in early design stage
   plans, the inability to automatically transfer the timber frame
   structure from IES VE to One Click LCA, and the uncertainty of future
   energy trends.},

Abstract = {Given the fragmented nature of the architecture, engineering,
   construction, and operation (AECO) industry, building lifecycle
   management (BLM) involves bringing together multidisciplinary teams and
   integrating lifecycle processes of buildings. Despite the increasing use
   of information technologies and software tools by property owners,
   several barriers in BLM implementations remain, such as information
   silos, low data interoperability, poor cross-party coordination, and the
   mismatch of existing commercial solutions and user requirements. To deal
   with these practical challenges, this study develops a BIM-enabled BLM
   system for property owners using a semi-custom approach. For this, a
   three-tier architecture of the BIM-enabled BLM system is designed. Next,
   the system is developed based on a real-life project in the Grid State
   of China. This case scenario verifies the system and further confirmed
   the proposed three-tier architecture. The developed architecture and
   system have theoretical and practical implications for property owners'
   BLM implementations. This proposed semi-custom approach provides
   guidelines for AECO industry digital transformation.},

Abstract = {The importance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in construction
   and facility operation is unquestionable, but there is a clear
   discrepancy between the data included in as-built BIM models and the
   expected use specified by customers. This disparity presents significant
   obstacles in properly using BIM for facility management and operational
   operations. The main goal of this research is to suggest inventive and
   pragmatic approaches that successfully address the discrepancy between
   the actual BIM model data, with a specific emphasis on COBie dataset,
   and the intended BIM applications outlined by stakeholders in the
   Employer's Information Requirement (EIR) for facility management and
   operation. The study methodology is based on a comprehensive examination
   of current literature, demo case studies, as well as standards
   pertaining to BIM data, COBie.Type, and EIR requirements. The results of
   this study consist of a collection of standards, procedures, and
   suggested practices specifically designed to improve the utilization of
   as-built BIM model data for facility management and operation. These
   will closely correlate with the BIM applications stated by the client.
   Furthermore, the project seeks to enhance industry norms and practices,
   promoting enhanced cooperation and information sharing among
   stakeholders. This research has also investigated the efficiency of
   Solibri Model Checker (SMC) to validate the COBie type and component
   information provided by COBie.},

Title = {Sustainability-Based Lifecycle Management for Bridge Infrastructure
   Using 6D BIM},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {A number of bridge infrastructures are rising significantly due to
   economic expansion and growing numbers of railway and road
   infrastructures. Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional
   design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction
   processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has
   been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and
   process the integration of information in a shared environment. This
   paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle
   asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a
   case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model
   information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint
   analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this
   paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon
   emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of
   the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment
   to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance.
   This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to
   bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D
   BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and
   reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages
   through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can
   promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied
   for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle
   asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time
   structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among
   working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various
   stakeholders.},

Title = {Whole Life Carbon Assessment of Buildings: The Process to Define Czech
   National Benchmarks},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in addressing
   human-induced impacts on the environment, with a particular focus on
   transitioning to sustainability and achieving carbon neutrality.
   However, the current implementation of Whole Life Carbon (WLC) and Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the construction sector in the Czech Republic
   is hindered by several challenges. These include gaps in stakeholders'
   knowledge, limited availability of LCA data on construction products and
   buildings, insufficient market incentives, and low institutional
   capacity. This study, conducted as part of the INDICATE project, aims to
   streamline the process of WLC calculation and establish a consistent
   national assessment method specific to the Czech context. The project
   encompasses various phases, i.e., a case study collection of office,
   multi-family, single-family, education, and logistic hall buildings,
   followed by the development of a comprehensive unified materials
   database, classification of building parts and uniform work with the
   bill of quantities, stakeholder engagement, an LCA of case studies with
   a sensitivity analysis, and WLC policy suggestions, including the
   quality of the project data, simplifications, and a benchmarks
   definition. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is calculated throughout
   the entire life cycle of each considered building, utilizing the EU
   Level(s) methodology incorporated in the OneClick LCA software. By
   adhering to these newly developed methodological steps, benchmarks for
   multi-residential buildings are shown. The same methodology could be
   replicated by stakeholders in other countries to enhance their
   evaluation processes and ensure consistent results across their
   projects.},

Abstract = {Building information Modelling (BIM) lies at the centre of construction
   industry's interest nowadays, with a revolutionary impact on the ways
   that professionals work, collaborate and conduct business. The
   application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with
   numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes
   across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and
   how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper
   performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape
   currently available for the construction industry across the various
   project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap
   analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different
   software application areas, software architecture, interoperability
   possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive
   statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented
   across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further
   hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated
   solutions addressed to advanced computer users. To this end, the paper
   aims to inform the industry's stakeholders, policy makers and software
   vendors, while shedding light on the extent that sophisticated BIM
   solutions can be disseminated to the market.},

Abstract = {The existing cloud calculation information park model is incomplete and
   cannot be used for the full lifecycle management. Thus, it is necessary
   to study and establish a more comprehensive cloud calculation
   information park model. The building information model, the supporting
   production information model, and the supporting process information
   model are established by the research of cloud calculation information.
   In order to express these models accurately, the parametric concept is
   proposed. Therefore, by combining with the corresponding building
   information, the cloud calculation information park is realized in the
   whole lifecycle. The maximize return is obtained by the suitable
   operation and maintenance.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the characteristics of the environmental impacts of
   apartment buildings, a typical housing type in South Korea, as part of a
   research project supporting the streamlined life cycle assessment
   (S-LCA) of buildings within the G-SEED (Green Standard for Energy and
   Environmental Design) framework. Three recently built apartment building
   complexes were chosen as study objects for the quantitative evaluation
   of the buildings in terms of their embodied environmental impacts
   (global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication
   potential, ozone layer depletion potential, photochemical oxidant
   creation potential, and abiotic depletion potential), using the LCA
   approach. Additionally, we analyzed the emission trends according to the
   cut-off criteria of the six environmental impact categories by
   performing an S-LCA with cut-off criteria 90-99\% of the cumulative
   weight percentile. Consequently, we were able to present the cut-off
   criterion best suited for S-LCA and analyze the effect of the cut-off
   criteria on the environmental impact analysis results. A comprehensive
   environmental impact analysis of the characteristics of the six
   environmental impact categories revealed that the error rate was below
   5\% when the cut-off criterion of 97.5\% of the cumulative weight
   percentile was applied, thus verifying its validity as the optimal
   cut-off criterion for S-LCA.},

Abstract = {Estimates of the environmental impacts of constructing and operating
   buildings are critical for improving the sustainability of construction.
   To identify the best design, a holistic approach is necessary,
   considering emissions, energy use, direct costs, potential earthquake
   costs, etc. Accordingly, this paper addresses a multitude of lifecycle
   impacts associated with the manufacturing, construction, operations,
   damage, and demolition of buildings. All impacts are translated into a
   common utility, measured in dollars. A collection of cost models is
   developed, and detailed building models are created from BIM, i.e.,
   building information modelling. A comprehensive analysis is conducted
   for a six-story building. Results show that the steel material option
   results in the lowest construction cost. The wood option results in the
   lowest cost of emissions, while the concrete option contributes the most
   to climate change. Earthquake damage accounts for about 3\% of the total
   expected cost, but the worst-case earthquake cost exceeds the building
   value.},

Abstract = {With the recent digitization of the construction industry, the
   management of a project, from the idea to the use phases, is now based
   on the Building Information Modelling System (BIM). While the use of BIM
   begins to show its effectiveness in building construction, it does not
   satisfy yet linear infrastructure domain. One of the requirements is to
   manage the infrastructure project data around a common information
   system, as defined by the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) definition.
   Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear
   infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways.
   The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is
   promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle
   management must now consider all phases of the project, especially
   Operations and Maintenance (O\&M), where the use of the 3D model is no
   longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the
   Infrastructure. To facilitate the digital transition when projects are
   split into several phases, the linear infrastructure must be represented
   by one and only one Digital Twin during its life cycle. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {The transportation infrastructure plays an important role in affecting
   the development of the national economy, which has developed rapidly in
   recent years. However, the cost of transportation projects is huge, and
   the traditional project process management causes a waste of time and
   resources. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is widely used in the
   building industry, but also can be used in the whole life cycle of
   transportation projects to improve the project efficiency. SWOT analysis
   is an important tool to assist the development of enterprises by
   analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. In
   this paper the authors use SWOT analysis to investigate the BIM
   application across the whole lifecycle of transportation projects and to
   provide advice for their future development accordingly. The result
   shows that although BIM can save time, money and resources, facilitate
   management and information exchange, and has a wide application
   prospect, there are still some technical and normative problems.
   Interaction between different specialties, information aggregation and
   fusion, and new regulations to deal with new technologies are all the
   problems to be resolved.},

Abstract = {AECO is struggling with data loss, inefficient processes and low
   productivity in asset management. The remedy to these problems seems to
   be the idea of Digital Twin (DT). However, the frameworks proposed so
   far do not always support a solution to these problems. This paper
   conducts an extensive literature review to develop a conceptual
   framework for the Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase for building
   facilities. The conceptual framework takes into account the increasingly
   popular Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   technologies. The foundation, however, is Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) technology. The presented framework, after appropriate
   modifications, can also be applied to infrastructure facilities or city
   fragments. The paper presents limitations and directions for further
   research. The DT paradigm has been adopted and its adoption is ongoing.
   Its implementation will progress in the coming years. The advantages and
   benefits are certainly more numerous than the barriers and risks posed
   by the use of DT.},

Title = {A Proposal for Streamlining 3D Digital Cadastral Data Lifecycle},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In urban areas, managing the lifecycle of land and property data related
   to interlocked and intertwined structures and infrastructure services is
   a grand challenge for cadastral systems. Addressing the physical and
   legal complexities of vertically stratified ownership arrangements is a
   major step towards the modernization of cadastral systems. The research
   problem that this study addresses is the lack of a simplified and
   effective approach for modelling, storing, visualizing, and querying 3D
   cadastral data for multi-story buildings. This research primarily leads
   to the development of an approach based on Building Information
   Modelling (BIM), as well as state-of-the-art ETL (extract, transform,
   load), database and visualization technologies for 3D cadastral data
   lifecycle management in current practices. The proposed steps for
   recording, preserving, and disseminating 3D cadastral data are crucial
   in shifting current 2D cadastral systems towards 3D digital information
   systems. The results showed improvements in data creation, storage,
   conversion, and communication when upgrading from a 2D to 3D digital
   cadastre. Therefore, this study confirmed that streamlining the
   lifecycle of cadastral data using 3D environments would mitigate issues
   associated with the current fragmented 2D cadastral datasets used in the
   multi-story developments.},

Title = {Lifecycle Exchange for Asset Data (LEAD) A proposed process model for
   managing asset dataflow between building stakeholders using BIM open
   standards},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to outline the problems
   associated with asset information management using the Construction
   Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) standard and to analyse
   the causes of industry failure to successfully adopt the standard. Based
   on this analysis, the paper will propose a process model, namely,
   Lifecycle Exchange of Asset Data (LEAD) to manage asset dataflow between
   all building stakeholders from design to construction and ultimately to
   the facility management team. This model aims to help the construction
   supply chain to produce complete and high-quality asset data that
   supports the operation phase of the built environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of relevant studies provided a
   theoretical background for this study. The authors then collected and
   analysed COBie data from five live construction projects using building
   information modelling (BIM) projects from different design and
   construction companies. The process model is based on an industry
   placement within Bouygues UK construction company, which was a Tier 1
   building contractor in London in the period from December 2016 to
   December 2018. The researcher used an inductive approach observing
   current practises in two construction projects to produce ``LEAD{''}
   model. Then a focus group was conducted with industry experts to discuss
   and refine the process model.
   Findings - Analysis of literature and data collected in the course of
   this study revealed that although COBie is a BIM Level 2 standard in the
   UK, there is currently a low success rate in producing complete and
   accurate COBie data in the UK construction industry. This low rate is
   because of COBie's rigid data syntax/structure, complexity and ambiguity
   of its data exchange process, which suggests that COBie may not be the
   future of the industry. Based on these findings, the study proposed a
   process model, namely, ``LEAD,{''} to improve COBie output and also to
   be used with project-specific information requirements.
   Practical implications - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
   paper is one of the first to focus solely on asset data exchange process
   using COBie standard and highlights the problems the industry faces in
   this remit. The study is based on industry placement for two years, so
   the analysis is based on actual and current industry problems. Current
   industry practices also informed the ``LEAD{''} model, and the model
   provides a step-by-step guidance in producing and exchanging BIM asset
   data in all stages of the building lifecycle.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a detailed analysis of the most
   common problems associated with COBie as an asset data exchange
   standard. Understanding these problems is of high value for industry
   practitioners to avoid them in projects. The paper also proposed a novel
   process model that can be used either to improve COBie quality or can be
   used with any project-specific data requirements.},

Abstract = {Built environment data is of varying nature embedding various forms of
   sensitivities with potential legal, contractual, intellectual property,
   and security implications. The paper presents a governance approach for
   managing multi-actor, multi-discipline, and total lifecycle data,
   informed by a wide industry consultation conducted in the UK between
   March and September 2011. The study identifies a number of barriers in
   engaging with Building Information Modelling (BIM) efforts with a view
   of facilitating collaboration around a common and integrated project
   specification. A governance model is proposed that addresses the
   identified adoption blockers underpinned by a ``mixed approach{''}, that
   factors in various modes of information delivery, ranging from
   paper-based documents to object-based information conveyed by IFC
   (Industry Foundation Classes). A demonstrator system is developed and
   used to validate our BIM governance concepts. Our governance model is
   discussed in the context of the recent UK government BIM industry
   consultation document supported by a research and development (R\&D)
   roadmap taking into account current industry structure and its various
   levels of stakeholders' maturity, capability and readiness.},

Abstract = {A Multi-purpose utility tunnel (MUT) is one of the civil infrastructures
   in urban areas, which accommodates several networks, such as electrical
   cables, gas, water, and sewer pipes, inside a tunnel. There are several
   benefits of MUTs compared to buried utilities. However, MUTs are not
   widely used at the time being due to the high initial construction cost
   and the need for coordination among utility owners. Building information
   modeling (BIM) is becoming the main coordination tool for building
   projects. BIM has been extended to civil infrastructures, such as
   bridges, roads, and sewer networks. However, BIM extension for MUT
   information modeling (MUTIM) is yet to be developed.
   This paper aims to investigate a method for extending BIM to MUT
   projects taking advantage of similar developments for other
   infrastructure systems. In addition, a systematic approach for MUTIM use
   cases is proposed. Five use cases of MUTIM were mentioned in this paper:
   (1) design review for checking compliance with standards and
   constructability; (2) 3D coordination for clash detection and
   resolution; (3) ergonomic design for human accessibility and comfort
   during construction, inspection and maintenance activities; (4) phase
   planning for construction and maintenance scheduling using 4D
   simulation; and (5) quantity takeoff for cost estimation. The first two
   MUTIM use cases are discussed in detail.
   A case study is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach. The presented MUTIM approach can improve MUT projects design
   and coordination efficiency, and reduce project cost, which are the main
   barriers for promoting MUTs.},

Abstract = {Substantial impacts through BIM implementation may be achieved
   throughout all stages of the construction process. The paper measures
   BIM use throughout the project lifecycle, confirming BIM is most often
   used in the early stages with progressively less use in the latter
   stages. This research demonstrates via 92 responses from a sample of BIM
   users that collaboration aspects produce the highest positive impact.
   The process aspects are more important than the software technology. BIM
   necessitates investment in software and training however, smaller
   practices can afford it. Stakeholder financial benefits are ranked
   concluding that clients benefit most financially from BIM followed by
   Facilities Managers. Despite this, over 70\% do not provide a 3D model
   and Cobie dataset at the conclusion of a project. Identification of Key
   Performance Indicators currently being used for BIM is provided and
   findings indicate a lack of industry expertise and training providing an
   opportunity for education providers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Recently, the application of the BIM technique to infrastructure
   lifecycle management has increased rapidly to improve the efficiency of
   infrastructure management systems. Research on the lifecycle management
   of infrastructure, from planning and design to construction and
   management, has been carried out. Therefore, a systematic review of the
   literature on recent research is performed to analyze the current state
   of the BIM technique. State-of-the-art techniques for infrastructure
   lifecycle management, such as unmanned robots, sensors and processing
   techniques, artificial intelligence, etc., are also reviewed. An
   infrastructure BIM platform framework composed of BIM and
   state-of-the-art techniques is then proposed. The proposed platform is a
   web-based platform that contains quantity, schedule (4D), and cost (5D)
   construction management, and the monitoring systems enable collaboration
   with stakeholders in a Common Data Environment (CDE). The lifecycle
   management methodology, after infrastructure construction, is then
   completed and is developed using state-of-the-art techniques using
   unmanned robots, scan-to-BIM, and deep learning networks, etc. It is
   confirmed that collaboration with stakeholders in the CDE in
   construction management is possible using an infrastructure BIM
   platform. Moreover, lifecycle management of infrastructure is possible
   by systematic management, such as time history analysis, damage growth
   prediction, decision of repair and demolition, etc., using a regular
   inspection database based on an infrastructure BIM platform.},

Abstract = {Dealing with and maintaining high-quality standards in the design and
   construction phases is challenging, especially for on-site construction.
   Issues like improper implementation of building components and poor
   communication can widen the gap between design specifications and actual
   conditions. To prevent this, particularly for energy-efficient
   buildings, it is vital to develop resilient, sustainable strategies.
   These should optimize resource use, minimize environmental impact, and
   enhance livability, contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and
   climate change mitigation. Traditional post-occupancy evaluations, which
   identify defects after construction, are impractical for addressing
   energy performance gaps. A new, real-time inspection approach is
   necessary throughout the construction process. This paper suggests an
   innovative guideline for prefabricated buildings, emphasizing digital
   `self-instruction' and `self-inspection'. These procedures ensure
   activities impacting quality adhere to specific instructions, drawings,
   and 3D models, incorporating the relevant acceptance criteria to verify
   completion. This methodology, promoting alignment with planned
   energy-efficient features, is supported by BIM-based software and
   Augmented Reality (AR) tools, embodying Industry 4.0 principles. BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) and AR bridge the gap between virtual
   design and actual construction, improving stakeholder communication and
   enabling real-time monitoring and adjustments. This integration fosters
   accuracy and efficiency, which are key for energy-efficient and nearly
   zero-energy buildings, marking a shift towards a more precise,
   collaborative, and environmentally sensible construction industry.},

Title = {Synchronizing BIM cost models and bills of quantities for lifecycle
   audit trail cost management},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 9},
Abstract = {PurposeAudit trail cost management is crucial for ensuring
   accountability and enhancing quality assurance in construction
   management. Despite limited practical studies on audit trail management
   from a cost perspective; this study developed a lifecycle-based audit
   trail cost management framework. It used synchronized Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) cost models and Bills of Quantities (BoQs) to
   address the existing gap.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed
   a descriptive case study approach of a real-life hospital project in
   China. Data triangulation was achieved through interviews, observations,
   documents, and relevant artifacts.FindingsThe study identified three key
   factors contributing to cost variances between BIM cost models and BoQs:
   differences in measurement rules, model precision, and professional
   errors, particularly evident during the preliminary estimate stage.
   Notably, significant cost savings of approximately RMB 5.811 million
   were achieved during the detailed estimate stage. During the
   construction phase, a synchronized approach was deployed to improve
   precise payment verification and modifications to the BIM model. In the
   post-construction phase, the synchronized as-built BIM models and BoQs
   served as primary references to facilitate the resolution of operational
   discrepancies.Practical implicationsThe research contributes to the
   literature by proposing a synchronized approach of BIM cost models and
   BoQs. This approach enhances traceability and accountability of project
   information, catering to the digitalization needs of the construction
   industry.Originality/valueThis study unveils a pragmatic approach to
   enhancing transparency and accountability in audit-trail cost management
   by synchronizing BIM cost models and BoQs at various project stages. The
   synchronized approach offers a promising direction for future research
   and implementation of audit trail frameworks to enhance cost management
   in construction.},

Title = {BIM-centered high-speed railway line design for full infrastructure
   lifecycle},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the field of civil engineering, specifically within railway projects,
   the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become
   imperative. However, the sector's adherence to traditional methods for
   infrastructure design and management has delayed the widespread adoption
   of BIM. This paper describes a BIMcentered methodology applied to a
   real-world High-Speed Railway Line (HSRL) project. Through an extensive
   examination of HSRL design parameters and the integration of various
   BIM-based tools, a 3D parametric design model is generated. This model
   serves as the foundation for evaluating up to five design alternatives,
   considering technical and economic aspects. Furthermore, a degradation
   model is proposed to assess alternative performance over the
   infrastructure's full lifecycle under specific rail traffic assumptions.
   This facilitates a rapid evaluation of alignment design's impact on
   maintenance costs. The paper draws two main conclusions with potential
   benefits for both private companies and railway administrations:
   Firstly, BIM proves feasible and advantageous despite some
   interoperability challenges, highlighting the need for continued
   advancements in BIM software compatibility. Secondly, the proposed
   approach can potentially lead to up to 40\% cost savings in maintenance
   for railway administrations.},

Abstract = {Purpose Integrated project delivery (IPD) and building information
   modeling (BIM) has begun to be used in real estate development projects
   over the past decade to improve collaboration, communication and
   efficiency. However, the use of BIM and IPD in projects does not always
   imply that the information is well used and managed. This study aims to
   explain how information management should be carried out in BIM and IPD
   projects, what activities should be managed by the information manager
   and which stakeholder should play this role and why?
   Design/methodology/approach This study provides a framework on the
   subject by conducting a comprehensive systematic review in the field of
   real estate development, BIM, IPD and information management. In this
   context, the Web of Science and Scopus databases have been
   systematically reviewed, n = 45 out of a total of n = 1,356 articles and
   additionally, the BIM documents and standards prepared by public
   institutions and organizations and industry reports have been examined
   in detail.
   Findings The framework for information management roles was established
   by reviewing the literature. According to this framework, information
   management activities of information managers are listed in the table
   that covers all phases of real estate development. The owner should
   undertake this role as it is the entity that oversees the built asset
   from planning to the management of that facility.
   Originality/value In terms of acquiring information management roles,
   there is no research on BIM and IPD projects and who will take over this
   role. This study desired to close this gap in the literature.},

Abstract = {Creating Digital Twin models for already existing substations is one of
   the big challenges for the Transmission and Distribution (T\&D)
   electrical industry - to reach the goal of digitalization of the assets.
   The Digital Twin follows all changes and represents the physical twin in
   a digital model - can be used for simulating, analysis of data,
   understanding of problems, monitoring and simulation of real-world
   conditions. To get a Digital Twin with innovative methods and less
   effort, the Scan to Twin principle is introduced, by creating - out of
   point clouds - a smart Building Information Modeling (BIM) model and
   Digital Twin with connections to other databases, as a real Virtual
   Reality (VR) substation simulation model. This paper describes the
   process of how to get the models, step by step, with a real use-case of
   an existing substation project of a transmission operator. The paper
   introduces a newly developed VR client solution connected to a BIM
   engineering solution to create - in a few clicks - VR models of existing
   substation BIM models.},

Abstract = {Purpose The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change
   the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset
   data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of
   things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this
   revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated
   workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site
   manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information,
   interoperability, transparency and ``big data{''} management are the
   main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst
   organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by
   utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or
   human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management
   of the data generated are not safe or reliable.
   Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in this paper
   addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present.
   Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility
   to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in
   all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these
   technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such
   as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment,
   will support information traceability from the strategic definition to
   end of life. Findings The framework of this study presents an excellent
   opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of
   new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established
   platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of
   digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the
   supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work
   together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of
   these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and
   digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic
   supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to
   stakeholders and users. Practical implications This study provides an
   exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite
   manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire
   life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value This paper
   contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use
   in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for
   future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these
   technologies and their workflows.},

Title = {Assessing the impact of overcoming BIM implementation barriers on BIM
   usage frequency and circular economy in the project lifecycle using
   Partial least Squares structural Equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis},

Abstract = {The construction sector is one of the fastest-growing in the world and
   significantly contributes to economic growth. To maximize profits
   without sacrificing quality, the concept of a successful building
   project should be applied throughout the different stages of a project's
   lifecycle. Although the implementation of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) has been lacking to a large extent in developing nations, a lot of
   studies have been done on BIM usage, awareness, barriers and drivers.
   However, no research has been done on the impact of the BIM barriers
   onBIM usage frequency in the project lifecycle. The research assesses
   the extent of influence of overcoming BIM implementation barriers
   (BIMIBs) on the BIM usage frequency (BF) at the different stages of the
   building lifecycle in the developing world. The study created a
   conceptual model based on a thorough literature review after which, a
   questionnaire survey which collected data from 103 professionals in the
   Ghanaian construction industry was used to perform a Partial Least
   Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The structural
   model adapted 14 attributes across 4 major BIMIBs namely Organizational
   (OB), Cost (CB), Technical (TB) and People (PB) related barriers as well
   as 7 attributes across 3 phase factors namely the PreConstruction (UP),
   Construction (UC) and Post Construction (UPC) phases. In order of
   significance, the study identified TB, PB, OB and CB as the most
   critical BIM implementation barriers that require urgent attention in
   the developing world with path coefficient values of 0.359, 0.314, 0.238
   and 0.199 respectively. Also, with a path coefficient value of 0.848,
   the PLS-SEM results revealed a positive and substantial influence of
   `overcoming BIMIBs(U)' on BIM usage(U) in the project lifecycle among
   professionals in the AEC industry of the developing world. Furthermore,
   the study discovered that, BF at UP ranked first followed by UC and UPC
   with scores of 0.894, 0.855 and 0.803 respectively. Lastly, the
   conceptual, empirical, managerial and theoretical implications of the
   model prediction were examined. Increasing the delivery of
   waste-efficient BIM-enabled projects within the built environment by
   overcoming the identified critical BIMIBs in the developing world is a
   major contribution of the study to the idea of the circular economy. In
   addition, the study's findings will serve as a guide for researchers,
   professionals, and academics in the developing world as they work to
   overcome BIM barriers and to promote BIM usage throughout the project
   lifecycle.},

Abstract = {Productivity in the construction industry (both houses and
   infrastructure) has not been improving as expected, while other
   industries have been able to improve their productivity significantly.
   The appropriate use of building information modelling (BIM) technologies
   brings several benefits and advantages to construction projects. The
   main challenges of project efficiency emerge in the form of numerous
   requests for information during the construction project, which are
   considered to be waste in the processes. This highlights the need for a
   practical process model to plan the information flow for BIM-based
   projects. The main aim of this study is to propose a model to plan the
   flow of project information among primary stakeholders especially in
   infrastructure projects. Our main findings are firstly, the foundation
   for data management starts from defining unified one data for the
   product and the for the process. Unified data means one single
   repository of data - all stakeholders use the same unified data. It is
   also essential that data responsibilities and ownership are defined.
   Secondly, we found that the biggest challenges are that the data needs
   are not planned beforehand, resistance to change, difficulty receiving
   existing data and data must be modified before use. As a whole, it seems
   sometimes that the technology on data transfer is more important that
   what has been transferred and why. Finally our construction, the life
   cycle model for data flow originates from one data to all stakeholders,
   single data repository must be updated along the lifecycle of the object
   covering also the operations and maintenance, where the data has to be
   updated through the whole life-cycle. This new approach is intended to
   enable the early involvement of maintenance stakeholders in designing
   product data for a project lifecycle perspective. The model helps to
   change the current information flow and gain the benefits that a
   BIM-based process can offer. This study is based on case studies and is
   qualitative in nature and naturally needs more validation.},

Abstract = {4D modeling has been an applied research area for around two decades
   since the first seminal works in the nineties. In the last years, a
   number of case studies have been published both for demonstrating the
   various applications of 4D and for assessing technological propositions.
   However, in most papers only little place is given to the particular
   content of 4D models. In parallel, following the growing implementation
   of Building Information Modeling, 4D modeling process is usually
   recognized as a ``BIM use{''}. In BIM implementations and protocols, the
   Level Of Development of datasets is a fundamental issue. This paper
   describes the application of two distinct ``4D uses{''} conducted on a
   single pilot project. They aim to assess the levels of graphical and
   temporal details required for the implemented uses. The authors finally
   discuss the diversity of 4D uses with 4D models, both planned or ad-hoc,
   as well as the logical understanding related to 4D LOD. (C) 2015 The

   perform and operate as intended during building lifecycle. Such
   assessment activities are typically multi-phase and multi-disciplinary,
   and generate large amounts of information that need efficient
   management. During the lifecycle of one building, multiple assessment
   methods are employed semi-concurrently and with a great deal of
   information overlap between successive phases. This information is
   semantically rich and context-dependent, reflecting the local
   perspective that it exists within. Usage of separate and disconnected
   tools for each method results in information fragmentation and
   redundancy, posing problems for well-informed decision making. The
   objective of this research is to develop an integral reference model,
   CLIP (Computational support for Lifecycle Integral Performance
   assessment), that aims to improve the efficiency and quality of existing
   performance assessment practices. The model provides flexible, modular,
   and extensible data structures and algorithms for the representation,
   transformation, integration, and visualization of performance
   information. The initial results support the CLIP model's ability to
   deal with the local volatility and variation in the processes and
   information content that is being managed, while requiring further
   refinement and extension work to achieve a customized solution to fit in
   different contextual settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Railway turnouts or so-called `switches and crossings' are complex
   systems by nature of design and construction. Railway turnouts are used
   to change direction of trains from one to another. They require
   high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid
   degradation and component failures that could result in train
   derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency
   and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing
   practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research
   establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle
   management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3) has integrated
   6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and
   Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D
   embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life
   cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to
   improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design,
   manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation,
   operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better
   project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of
   railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on
   economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among
   them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver
   its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical
   communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors,
   accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction
   duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency,
   supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher
   operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The
   results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor
   towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing
   stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of
   life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation
   among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management
   team. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Challenges in the extraction and use of earth resources and spaces are
   encountered given a growing worldwide population, rising infrastructures
   development, and widespread climate change. In Australia, mining and
   construction are two major bases for economic growth while both being
   traditional hazardous and heavy industries. A nation-wide infrastructure
   upgrade featuring large-scale underground development is underway, the
   geological uncertainties and localisation difficulties of already laid
   infrastructure are associated with challenges not seen in building
   construction. A safer and competent subterranean transport solution is
   yet proposed in the context of sustainable developments. In light of
   this, geotechnical analysis as a fundamental subject for developing and
   maintaining safe and sustainable use of underground space has huge
   potential to be undertaken more intuitively considering the advancements
   in information management and visualisation. The PhD work examines the
   state-of-the-art applications, limitations and future opportunities of
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other computational techniques
   in the digitisation of tunnelling and underground construction. The
   visualisation and interoperability facilitated by data-driven processes
   are especially important to underground construction that engages
   interdisciplinary and multi-environment interaction.},

Abstract = {The problem of data integration throughout the lifecycle of a
   construction project among multiple collaborative enterprises remains
   unsolved due to the dynamics and fragmented nature of the construction
   industry. This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on
   China's special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built
   BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised
   application model that correlates project engineering data and project
   management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social
   networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised
   single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that
   integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the
   adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms
   that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data
   are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation
   and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List
   series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file
   versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real
   applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not
   only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a
   consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction
   project. This system will reduce costs for construction firms by
   providing effective and efficient means and guides to complex project
   management, and by facilitating the conversion of project data into
   enterprise-owned properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Integrating BIM and Blockchain across construction lifecycle and supply
   chains},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Construction industry has a complex structure with multiple parties
   involved, which often leads to ``adversarial relationships{''}, ``risk
   avoidance{''}, and a ``lack of trust{''}among the different actors. This
   culture is further compounded by a ``linear workflow{''}that often
   results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste.
   Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a
   decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have
   access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the
   different stages of the project, and even automate some processes
   increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework. This study
   highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it
   can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing
   multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent
   way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the
   likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper
   explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and
   supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to
   streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource
   traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a
   detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction
   industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore,
   this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and
   Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the
   smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus
   providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this
   integration.},

Abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems have been used in
   different applications in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction,
   Owner and Operator (AECOO) industry. Applications are mainly designed
   for specific lifecycle stage of the facility and serve the needs of only
   one of the stakeholders. This would increase the cost and the labor for
   adding and removing tags and eliminate the chance of using shared
   resources. In this paper, the usage of tags permanently attached to
   components is proposed where the memory of the tags is used during the
   lifecycle by different stakeholders for data storage and handover. A
   Building Information Model (BIM) database is used for tackling the
   interoperability issues allowing different users to access and share the
   data. To securely and efficiently store data on RFID tags in ifcXML
   format, multi-level encryption together with role-based access control
   is applied on the data stored on RFID tags. Each user is assigned a
   certain role and can only access the part of data for which he has
   authorization according to a predefined role and the Access Control
   Policy. To explore the technical feasibility of the proposed approach, a
   case study considering both facilities management and emergency
   management has been implemented and tested at Concordia University. (C)

Abstract = {Within the global economy, the built environment makes a major
   contribution to economic activity and has a significant impact on
   sustainability. In addition, the built environment plays a significant
   social role as it influences where we live along with how we work,
   entertain, and learn. Even though the built environment plays such a
   significant social and economic role, it has been slow in adopting
   emerging technologies to make the way we design, build, utilize, and
   decommission more efficient while having less of a negative impact on
   the environment. This paper explores how we can integrate data science
   and Cyber Physical Systems into the built environment to achieve greater
   efficiencies. This paper introduces some of the industry challenges
   along with an overview of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper
   includes qualitative interview data that is driving the development of a
   working model that integrates emerging technologies to achieve budget,
   schedule, and sustainability efficiencies. Finally, the paper discusses
   how it is envisaged that integrating these technologies will improve
   decision-making within the built environment lifecycle.},

Title = {Impact factor analysis affecting the operation of asset lifecycle by

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 5},
Abstract = {PurposeCurrently, owners find it difficult to manage their assets
   throughout their project life cycle. The fact that asset information
   models (AIMs) are mandatory as deliverables for building information
   modeling-driven projects makes it a key requirement for the client to
   understand in detail those factors affecting asset operation. Hence,
   because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most significant market in
   the Middle East, this study aims to investigate those factors where
   blockchain and AIMs could impact the asset management (AM) life
   cycle.Design/methodology/approachResearchers used a hypothesis-based
   approach over a systematic literature review and a workshop (descriptive
   statistics) to understand the current challenges in AM. Later, a second
   workshop was run to understand the impact factor analysis affecting the
   operation of the asset life cycle by using asset information modeling
   and blockchain technology over a multiquantitative
   method.FindingsResults found that factors affecting the operation of
   assets could be the improvement of trust and stakeholder's influences;
   the availability of handover process products' accurate data;
   manufacturers providing detailed product models; increasing the speed of
   preparing holistic and integrated AM systems; improving collaboration
   between stakeholders; and returning clients' investments
   faster.Originality/valueUnderstanding the factors affecting AM life
   cycle based on the utilization of AIMs and blockchain then allows
   investors and their team members to work in a secure and collaborative
   environment that helps them to pre-identify certain risks and improve
   decision-making in a more effective way, as is required by ISO55000.},

Abstract = {In the IntUBE project, we proposed an energy-information integration
   platform to model energy information throughout the whole building life
   cycle. This ``platform{''} approach, however, limited the energy
   information to the domains established by the data repositories and
   constrained the relations between data to their contents. In a later
   project, REPENER, we have overcome these limitations by adopting the
   Linked Open Data approach to create a semantically-based energy
   information system. In this paper we present the structure of the system
   and the results obtained in the first implementation phase.},

Title = {A Computing Model for Lifecycle Health Performance Evaluations of
   Sustainable Healthy Buildings},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {As hazardous substances generated indoors are becoming a greater social
   issue, sustainable healthy buildings are being increasingly spotlighted.
   Sustainable healthy buildings refer to those buildings that maintain a
   certain level of health performance for their lifecycle. The health
   performance can be evaluated in terms of time, space and health factors.
   Previous studies on healthy buildings have mostly focused on pollutant
   emissions from materials and evaluation indicators, and the studies
   conducted on performance evaluations have been limited to specific areas
   such as indoor air quality (IAQ). However, it is necessary to assess the
   lifecycle health performance of health factors including IAQ,
   temperature, humidity, noise and lighting. In addition, a computing
   model is required to easily and promptly calculate the health factors
   and share health performance evaluation results during the planning,
   design, construction and operation and maintenance (O \& M) phases. The
   purpose of this study is to propose a computing model for lifecycle
   health performance evaluation (LHPE model) of sustainable healthy
   buildings. The LHPE model consists of a lifecycle health performance
   tree (LHT) model, a process model and an information model. The LHPE
   model is intended to be used as a tool to draw out the comprehensive
   health performance of buildings with ease and quickness, when the
   evaluation indicators of the factors are completed in the near future.},

Abstract = {The simulation of building efficiency and cost is a crucial driver to
   contemporary building design today. This paper presents the development
   of a software tool to simulate the lifecycle costs of building
   construction and maintenance. It is a part of the nD modelling tool
   development and also based on the overall system architecture of the nD
   modelling tool. nD modelling aims to integrate a number of design
   dimensions into a holistic model, which would enable users to portray
   and visually project the building design over its complete lifecycle.
   The overall architecture of the nD modelling tool is based upon IFC
   models, which are visualized in an integrated and interactive user
   interface. Thus, this tool can inherit design information through IFC
   models, which may be converted from the design drawings generated in
   various CAD systems. This lifecycle costing tool provides users with the
   options of different building materials and constructing methods on
   individual building components. Designers can make their decisions based
   on the lifecycle cost performance of these materials and constructing
   methods. The detailed maintenance costs across the building lifecycle
   and the cost components are clearly illustrated in charts and tables.
   Some key parameters of lifecycle costing can also be modified, and the
   dynamic changes of the lifecycle costs can also be revealed in the
   charts and tables promptly. Finally, the evaluations and conclusions of
   this tool also are discussed and drawn.},

   the design and the management process. The building activity generates a
   great number of data and information of various kinds. The management
   and the communication of these data by the various participants is
   complex. Our design and management methods use IFC files to facilitate
   the sharing process for a better qualification and validation of data.

Abstract = {The development of real estates in relation to the design process is
   increasingly based on sustainable aspects in order to ensure the value
   of real properties at an early stage. Due to this aspect, a holistic
   cost-analysis is important, which combines production and user costs for
   the life-cycle cost calculation on the one hand and the identification
   of the expected return and yield during the operating phase on the other
   hand. An automatic combination of the information included in a digital
   model with other complementary indicators is required for an early stage
   cost-analysis. As a result, specifications for the building construction
   and operational aspects may be planned in advance in order to create an
   economically built and operated property ensuring a sustainable value of
   the property. Main purpose of this article is to present this approach
   relating to the stage of development by using building information
   modeling techniques.},

Abstract = {This research examines how Holistic Building Design (HBD) affects
   Lifecycle Management of Building Structures in the ever-changing
   construction market. HBD includes adaptability, environmental
   sustainability, maintenance, and disaster preparation. It is a key idea
   in the present boom in resilient and sustainable building techniques. A
   surprising dearth of quantitative empirical research on HBD's impact on
   LMBS considering the field's growing importance. This study uses a
   quantitative method to explore the relationship between essential HBD
   components and LMBS outcomes especially Extended Service Life (ESL) and
   Optimized Performance and Value (OPV) are critical factors to address
   this information gap. The quantitative study polled 171 construction
   industry professionals and utilized Structural Equation Modelling to
   examine the data. This approach was selected for its ability to explore
   complex relationships between variables and constructs. HBD components
   Adaptability and Retrofitting (AAR), Environmental Considerations and
   Sustainability (ECS), Maintenance and Inspection Programs (MIP), and
   Resilience and Disaster Preparedness (RDP) profoundly influenced the
   Enhanced Service Life (ESL) and Optimized Performance and Value (OPV)
   elements of LMBS. Building adaptation and retrofitting, maintenance and
   inspection programs, and other activities increased building value and
   lifespan. These findings have major theoretical and practical
   implications. The work potentially fills a research gap by providing
   actual evidence on HBD-LMBS linkages. Practically, the results advise
   construction industry specialists to use HBD ideas for sustainable
   building management. Finally, our work illuminates the vital roles of
   HBD components in LMBS and paves the way for ecologically friendly
   building approaches.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is responsible for more than 40\% of the
   carbon emissions in the United States. These emissions are generated by
   energy, water, and materials consumed at different stages of the
   construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal processes and during
   the recycling and reusing of construction components as materials or
   biomass. Carbon-emission modeling is a complex procedure of process and
   footprint integration for different components either directly and
   indirectly associated with a service, product, material, or system at
   different phases. Prior research focused on each phase separately and/or
   supplemental information from alternative sources because of the lack of
   available data and information. Even though there are comprehensive
   lifecycle models covering every phase of a project, these models do not
   integrate existing models. The purpose of this study was to develop a
   comprehensive framework of building lifecycle carbon-emission modeling
   that would integrate existing models, information, and data. This
   research integrated prior models and methods, incorporated multitier
   mechanisms, and developed flexibility within the model so that
   reliability would be improved for measuring, tracking, and quantifying
   carbon-and environmental-related features, factors, and variables. This
   paper discusses the first phase of the research, model development, and
   testing. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {The challenge that sustainable buildings movement faces is, ``how to
   maintain the intended sustainable performance with regards to low energy
   use, indoor comfort and projected operating costs savings over the long
   term use of the building{''} Rapid decline in sustainable performance of
   a few high-profile buildings affects credibility of the High Performance
   buildings initiatives, reinforces doubts amongst climate-change
   non-believers and slows down the enthusiasm of the investors. Examining
   the lifecycle performance and costs, raising the awareness of building
   owners and tenants, adopting the best operational and maintenance
   practices by trained and skilled operating staff, and incorporating
   measurements, verification and automation technologies to automatically
   track and optimize the performance of all key buildings systems needs to
   become an essential part of property management culture to avoid
   pitfalls.
   Emergence of Building Energy Labeling Program and Building Information
   modeling techniques coupled with energy use sub- metering can alert of
   issues during commissioning, building occupancy, tenant-fit ups,
   building-use changes or of decline in performance due to poor operations
   and maintenance management. Building Heating, Ventilation and Air
   Conditioning systems are significant users of energy as well as their
   operations and maintenance impacts the health and security of tenants.
   Therefore, proper design, configuration, commissioning, operations and
   maintenance of such systems continues to offer opportunities for
   reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, and any lapses in monitoring
   and correcting deficiencies creates shortfall in sustainable performance
   over the life of a building. As the largest single landlord in the
   United States, the Federal Government oversees about 500,000 federal
   buildings. With additional resources being made available under the
   Recovery Act funding, new tools are emerging to allow monitoring and
   control of energy use.
   This paper outlines various qualitative and quantitative measures that
   can be practiced to improve and sustain performance of all building
   systems and infrastructure elements. Amongst all the measures, having
   trained and motivated operations and maintenance staff involved from
   concepts stage through design, construction, commissioning, and
   operations not only facilitates meeting the original design intent, but
   also allows to make adaptive changes with changes in occupancy,
   functionality, codes, standards or security requirements. Such general
   practices can assure sustenance of energy and environmental performance
   over the life cycle of systems and buildings. This paper also emphasizes
   how industry professional and trade organizations can guide towards
   standards and guidelines that can be more easily assimilated by the
   operations and maintenance staff and can help modify human behavior
   towards not only designing, but maintaining a more socially and
   environmentally responsible built-environment.},

Abstract = {There are various types of ancillary building facilities of highway,
   including management facilities (management sub-center, toll station,
   maintenance, highway administration, overloading management, tunnel
   management, bridge management, and rescue station) and service
   facilities (parking area and service area), which are distributed on
   both sides of highways according to the line selection and function
   requirements of highway; however, because of the concept of
   ``ancillary{''} and scale, they are completely out of step with the
   development trend and requirements of the times. In spite of small scale
   and land area, ancillary building facilities of highway have their own
   system and consume more resources and energy than urban buildings from
   building construction, operation and maintenance, demolition, and
   disposal of building materials. If they aren't designed in a reasonable
   way, they will emit more carbon dioxide and damage the natural
   ecological environment along the highway. Since building is a product
   with a long lifecycle, the study on the carbon emission of buildings
   needs to explore the characteristics of each stage in the lifecycle of
   buildings, so as to find out the scheme having the least impact on
   environment and achieve low energy consumption, low emission, and even
   zero emission. According to the characteristics of building activities
   in the full lifecycles of different types of ancillary building
   facilities of highway, this paper studies how to build a BIM model from
   design and construction to operation and maintenance of buildings with
   BIM technology and then establish a full-lifecycle carbon emission model
   of buildings by using the theory of full-lifecycle assessment, in order
   to determine the zero-carbon design method for ancillary building
   facilities of highway.},

Abstract = {The current lifecycle management of construction projects has long been
   plagued by the dilemma of ``lack of information{''} and ``information
   explosion{''}. This paper aims to develop a closed-loop lifecycle
   management system that can enable a consistent stream of information for
   use and reuse of all stakeholders. The framework integrates the
   state-of-the-art smart construction, construction automation and
   internet of things (IoT) technologies to help fragmented practitioners
   access and manage the information via a standardized interface among
   various applications throughout the whole lifecycle. Within the
   closed-loop lifecycle management system for IoT-based smart
   construction, digital technologies such as 3D laser scanner, drone,
   building information modelling (BIM), augmented reality (AR), Auto-ID,
   global positioning system (GPS), wireless sensor network (WSN),
   robotics, mobile digital devices, and web-based applications are used to
   collect proactive data from different stages. Further, the data are
   stored, shared, processed, and utilized in one unified platform for all
   stakeholders to support better decision- making and interaction
   throughout a project lifecycle. The framework is a guideline of
   real-time visualized tracking and operation, real-time environment
   supervision, real-time feedback and alarm, cloud backup, and data
   analysis demonstration which enable smart construction from head to toe.},

Abstract = {The data warehouse has played a very important role in the
   transformation of the state owned telecommunications company in South
   Africa. This transformation process concentrated firstly on targets set
   by government during the exclusivity period and secondly, on the
   preparation for competition. A new Double Wave Data Warehouse lifecycle
   model was developed and followed to fulfil the immediate need for
   information through the building of a DW and BI solution in the company.
   It consisted of two iterations for the development of a DW and 131
   solution. Wave one concentrated on the rapid implementation of a
   Business Critical Information Solution. In this regard management
   information on bad debts and debtors days were considered as Business
   Critical Information Solution needs. Wave 2 concentrated on modelling
   the ongoing requirement into a permanent dimensional model.},

Title = {Analysis of FM involvement during project Lifecycle phases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 9},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to analyze the facilities managers' involvement
   over the project life cycle phases (PLP), based on theoretical
   knowledge, consensus from empirical assessment of facilities managers
   and consultants' practices.Design/methodology/approachA literature
   review was undertaken to determine the different tasks that facilities
   managers typically handle, identify project phases and their underlying
   activities in which facilities managers would be involved. This was
   followed by targeting a group of consultants to build a consensus, upon
   the identified involvement of facilities managers, over the PLP, while
   measuring the level of involvement from a representative group of
   facilities managers in Saudi Arabia. A matching between the perceptions
   and practice has been performed to serve as recommendations for future
   research on improving the practice in Saudi Arabia.FindingsThe
   involvement of facilities managers in the PLP is relatively low,
   according to the consultants' perceptions. Consultants perceive that
   facilities managers should be involved in more professional activities,
   which would ultimately improve projects' delivery to clients.Practical
   implicationsThe involvement of facilities managers over the PLP ensures
   effective delivery of projects and reduces the multiplicity of
   challenges at the operation and maintenance phase. The viewing of
   facility managers' involvement adds to the effectiveness of their role
   within the building industry.Originality/valueThis paper investigates
   the consultants' perception of the involvement venues for facility
   managers to perform activities which are evaluated to be
   ``mandatory,{''} ``advantageous{''} or ``not necessary.{''} The study
   reflects the state of facilities management practice, and the consensus
   of consultants toward the role of the facility managers through the PLP.},

Abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an emerging technology in the
   building industry. Many researchers have demonstrated how to enhance
   material control or production management with RFID. However, there is a
   lack of integrated understanding of lifecycle management. This paper
   develops and demonstrates a framework to Information Lifecycle
   Management (ILM) with RFID for material control. The ILM framework
   includes key RFID checkpoints and material types to facilitate material
   control on construction sites. In addition, this paper presents a
   context-aware scenario to examine multiple on-site context and RFID
   parameters. From tagging nodes at the factory to reading nodes at each
   lifecycle stage, this paper demonstrates how to manage complex
   construction materials with RFID and how to construct integrated
   information flows at different lifecyde stages. To validate key material
   types and the scenario, the study reports on two on-site trials: read
   distance test and on-site simulation. Finally, the research provides
   discussion and recommended approaches to implementing ILM. The results
   show that the ILM framework has the potential for a variety of
   stakeholders to adopt RFID in the building industry. This paper provides
   the understanding about the effectiveness of ILM with RFID for material
   control, which can serve as a base for adopting other IT technologies in
   the building industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {559-583},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study attempts to expand knowledge of product lifecycle
   management (PLM) and supporting systems. Its objective is threefold:
   first, to identify and assess the impact of two key PLM building blocks
   on new product performance. Second, to use the aforementioned PLM
   building blocks to highlight the distinctive nature of PLM and
   closed-loop PLM systems. Third, to demonstrate that the closed-loop PLM
   system provides more new product benefits than the PLM system and that
   the usage of the closed-loop PLM system is positively related to new
   product development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research hypotheses were tested on
   data collected from 87 manufacturers in the transportation equipment
   manufacturing industry in one Canadian province.
   Findings - The findings show that only ten manufacturers have adopted a
   closed-loop PLM system. As expected, the results show that the two key
   PLM building blocks, namely operational integration and information
   system (IS) usage, are positively related to new product development.
   Findings also show that the level of forward operational integration is
   similar in the closed-loop PLM system and in the PLM system, while the
   level of backward operational integration, the usage of the PLM system
   and new product development are higher in the closed-loop PLM system.
   Finally, the results demonstrate that the usage of the closed-loop PLM
   system is positively related to new product development.
   Originality/value - This contribution should give academics and
   practitioners alike a better understanding of the role and benefits of
   PLM and its supporting systems (the PLM system and the closed-loop PLM
   system).},

Title = {Influence of key role players on productivity outcomes in the
   residential building lifecycle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {528-551},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to answer the `what' and `how' questions about
   the key role players' influence on the overall productivity outcomes in
   the lifecycle of residential buildings procured through the traditional
   route.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mix of exploratory and descriptive
   research methods was used to obtain feedback from 179 role-players
   involved in various phases of the residential building lifecycle (RBLC)
   in New Zealand. Empirical data were analysed using content analysis,
   multi-attribute method and Friedman's two-way analysis of variance.
   Findings - Results showed that designers, building owners, main
   contractors and project managers were the greatest influencers of the
   productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The priority drivers of these key
   role-players' influences on the RBLC productivity outcomes comprised
   poor brief interpretation, inclination to lowest tender, inadequate
   prior risk analysis and miscommunication of owner's requirements and
   preferences to service providers, respectively. By taking proactive
   steps to redress their productivity inhibiting acts/omissions as
   identified in this study, the various role-players could contribute to
   significant improvement of productivity outcomes in the building
   lifecycle.
   Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to interview all
   participants that made up the representative random samples from each
   role-player group due largely to workload related excuses. As a result,
   the findings and the conclusions may not be generalised beyond the study
   scope. However, the study achieved its purpose, as the main intent was
   to provide hypothetical constructs that could guide further
   confirmatory/experimental studies for residential buildings as well as
   for other building types.
   Practical implications - A succinct and easy-to-follow model was
   developed as implementation pathway for operationalising the key
   findings of the study in the industry. The model highlights the
   Owner-Architect-Contractor Influence Triangle (OACIT) as the 20 per cent
   of the solutions that could deliver 80 per cent of the productivity
   improvement in the RBLC.
   Originality/value - This study re-examines productivity issues not only
   from a life-cycle perspective but also from the perspectives of the
   majority of the key role-players. In addition, the OACIT concept offers
   a novel productivity improvement tool; it stresses that productivity in
   the traditionally procured building lifecycle could be optimised if the
   architect could focus greater attention on brief articulation and the
   issuance and review of design and specification information. Also, the
   owner should adopt productivity-enhancing procurement and contract
   strategies and emphasise more on value-addition and less on lowest
   tender price.},

Abstract = {For performing design tasks in a process plant construction project
   using a three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design system, it is
   necessary to build a library to save catalogs containing information on
   3D shape, specifications, and ports for bulk materials, such as pipes
   and fittings, or custom-built equipment, such as large equipment and
   skids. Furthermore, a library must be effectively reused as the building
   process requires considerable time and cost. In this study, a system
   architecture that manages the entire lifecycle of a catalog is proposed
   for generating, saving, and managing a neutral catalog for components
   and for converting to a native format of a commercial system needed by
   users. Subsequently, detailed technologies required to implement such
   architecture are discussed. Lastly, experiments on building, searching,
   and exchanging are conducted for approximately 3000 catalogs provided by
   company P in Korea to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   architecture for lifecycle management of a component catalog.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to clarifying how the implementation of product
   lifecycle management systems allow firms to improve market
   responsiveness due to the lack of understanding the mediating
   mechanisms. Empirical research that studies the mechanisms underlying
   the impact of product lifecycle management systems on market
   responsiveness has been scarce. To address the research issues, this
   study draws on dynamic capability view and the notion of information
   technology - business capability - organizational performance links to
   develop a theoretical model and employs empirical research methods to
   evaluate the model. The research results reveal that product lifecycle
   management system implementation allows firms to increase market
   responsiveness through the two enhanced partner management capabilities,
   namely relationship-building capability and coordination capability. By
   clearly identifying the underlying mechanism of product lifecycle
   management system-enabled market responsiveness, this study advances the
   current understanding of how product lifecycle management system
   implementation enables firms to improve market responsiveness.},

Title = {Exploring lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of a case study
   with ambitious energy compensation goals in a cooling-dominated climate},

Abstract = {Achieving low operational energy (OE) consumption in high heating and
   cooling situations typically leads to well-insulated buildings. In those
   cases, embodied energy (EE) can exceed the operational share. Specific
   literature refers mostly to heating-dominated residential buildings,
   with a clear focus on European, Asian, and North American countries.
   Information on embodied impacts of buildings other regions is virtually
   inexistent. This paper aims at estimating lifecycle energy and
   greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of selected design versions of a
   photovoltaic-powered Living Lab in Campinas, Brazil; and at finding the
   embodied-to-operational impact ratios as well as the main contributors
   to those overall impacts. Homer Energy software supported sizing of
   photovoltaic (PV) arrays for ten energy compensation scenarios to, based
   on simulated OE, determine the feasibility threshold for onsite
   generation admitted by the building design. We then modelled lifecycle
   energy and GHG emissions for the net zero (NZE) and threshold energy
   positive (E+) versions of the case study design. The Cumulative Energy
   Demand (CED) and the CML 2001 v.2.05 methods supported embodied energy
   and global warming potential (GWP) calculations in SimaPro 7.3. The E+
   building compensates its OE plus non-renewable energy embodied in
   building products. Steel frame and partitions were the largest
   contributors to EEG in building products, whilst the insulated facade
   panels and PV array performed key energy performance roles at
   comparatively lower embodied impacts. Shifting from NZE towards E+
   status discretely increased the embodied-to-operational energy ratio
   (EE:OE), at similar embodied-to-operational GHG emissions (EG:OG)
   ratios. Pre-use share of lifecycle CED was slightly surpassed by the
   operational one, whilst responding for 60\% of lifecycle GWP. Material
   replacement over the reference service life contributed significantly to
   operational impacts. EOL treatment had negligible effect on lifecycle
   impacts. EE more than tripled OE and embodied emissions exceeded OG by a
   factor of seven. EEG prominence confirms the crucial need for a
   harmonized calculation approach, as experienced for operational stage
   accountancy over the recent years. We acknowledge the high uncertainties
   involved in using simulated over measured OE consumption and in using
   foreign LCI databases. The former limitation can be solved by monitoring
   operational performance upon projects completion. This study offers
   practical and detailed reference for LCA practitioners in all countries
   facing the latter challenge, which will persist until integrated
   national LCI databases finally become available. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Many uncertainties arise in system developments since the system became
   complex, large-scale, and deployed in uncertain environment. Developers
   cannot determine some type of uncertainties until start of operation. In
   order to deal with changing requirements and environments caused by
   these uncertainties, we have to tackle with building an architecture
   that takes operations into account in a system development lifecycle. In
   this paper, we propose a lifecycle-oriented development process which
   improve the requirement and design in terms of uncertainties for
   realizing sustainable information architecture for smart mobility. As a
   case study, we apply the proposed method to a development of Patrash
   which is a transfer guide application.},

Abstract = {In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are
   introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control
   towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect
   complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process
   optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle
   management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the
   real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of
   Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with
   proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building
   asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability,
   interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM
   to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were
   performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability,
   interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides
   decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation
   of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of
   CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as
   integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.},

Abstract = {The article presents studies aimed at the formation of an adaptive
   management system based on the information approach and digitalization
   of management processes. A conceptual dynamic model of an adaptive
   control system for large-scale and technically complex construction
   objects, consisting of two control loops with a description of their
   functional purpose, is proposed. The material proposes a programming
   technique based on the schedule of key project events, which is the
   basis for building a reference model for project implementation. In
   turn, the reference model is the main element of the adaptive control
   loop, represented by transition operators written in a matrix form
   convenient for machine use. Based on the resource approach for the
   effective development of control actions, it is proposed to distinguish
   three levels of management decisions: operational, tactical and
   strategic. The interfaces and services of the adaptive control system
   are systematized and classified, as a description of its digital
   profile. The study presents the results of the practical implementation
   of the proposed approaches by the author's software package, which is
   the basis for the formation of an adaptive control system.},

Title = {Digital Twin Hospital Buildings: An Exemplary Case Study through
   Continuous Lifecycle Integration},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings usually contain sophisticated facility systems and
   special medical equipment, strict security requirements, and business
   systems. Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of
   real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing
   innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle
   integration{''} method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and
   ``early movement{''} of the general contractor, this paper reported a
   successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized
   continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of
   more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O\&M
   phase up to the O\&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time
   visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was
   developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have
   the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual
   management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation
   suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building
   to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in
   the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy
   consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested
   repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

   technologies, among which are digital twins. New goals and opportunities
   are appearing that minimize the impact on a building's lifecycle, reduce
   economic, environmental, and extra-social costs, optimize energetic
   performance, decrease energy consumption and emissions, and enhance the
   durability and service life of buildings and their components. Among the
   research activities that have led to the development of a maintenance
   management model (MMM), this paper deals with the digital-twin approach,
   considering it instrumental to the innovative governance of the building
   environment from a lifecycle-based and sustainable perspective. It
   includes paying attention to efficiency in terms of resource use, energy
   consumption, and the energy performance of buildings, supporting
   decarbonization processes, and environmental vulnerability due to
   natural disasters, extreme weather, and seismic events. Its current
   implementation is presented here. In this scenario, the authors,
   operating at BIG srl, an academic spinoff of the Mediterranean
   University of Reggio Calabria, Italy, working together with the startup
   Sysdev, based in Torino, Italy, the company Berna Engineering srl, based
   in Reggio Calabria, Italy, and ACCA Software spa, based in Avellino,
   Italy, introduce the experimental application of the DT4SEM for safety
   and well-being in buildings, which is specifically oriented to seismic
   behavior monitoring. The proposal, while highlighting the innovative
   character of DT approaches, responds to the need for reliable data for
   increasingly effective forecasts and the control of the seismic behavior
   of buildings, facilitating informed decision-making for building
   management while also optimizing maintenance schedules.},
