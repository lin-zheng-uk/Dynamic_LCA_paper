	abstract = {Building clean and modern multi-energy complementary systems is a direct path to decarbonization in energy sector. The introduction of hydrogen energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system, consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process, and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective. The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in this study decreased by 82.75 %. In addition, considering that the system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 % but only increase costs by about 29.4 %. The computational results justify the proposed optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference for practice. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Accurately quantifying carbon mitigation of operational photovoltaics (PVs) influenced by dynamic geo-environment is crucial for developing suitable initiatives on renewable energy transition. However, previous studies made strong assumptions to avoid modelling spatial heterogeneity of carbon footprints or ignore weather and shadowing effects on PV electricity generation, making the estimated results unreliable and even causing false policymaking. To tackle this challenge, we developed a novel model coupling multi-sourced data modelling and life-cycle assessment to estimate spatially heterogenous carbon mitigation of all the operational rooftop PVs in an entire city. It is built by three hierarchal modules: (i) segmenting PV areas from high-resolution satellite imagery, by using Deep Solar PV Refiner, an advanced semantic segmentation network; (ii) estimating electricity generation in the segmented PV areas, by using a well-developed 3D solar irradiation model that considers the effects of land surface solar irradiation influenced by weather and shadowing effects produced by 3D buildings; (iii) quantifying carbon mitigation potential of PVs, by developing a spatial-aware life-cycle model to track the life-cycle carbon footprints of PVs from production, transportation, operation, to decommission. Investigating Singapore by 2020, we reveal that industrial, airport, and residential areas have the largest rooftop PV installation. We also suggest a carbon emission rate of 13.20 g-CO2/kWh, a carbon payback time of 0.81 years, and an energy payback time of 0.94 years, showing an improved carbon mitigation capability compared to the past years. This study contributes to GIS data modelling and helps understand the geospatial characteristics of urban-scale PV carbon mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Incorporating the concept of applying GIS, the planning and survey data mentioned above will be used as the basis for the future research design and implementation. Aerial maps will be combined with cadastral and topographic maps to establish a basic evaluation resource map: a site plan map, data point map, building carbon footprint map, and route carbon footprint map.

Through putting solar panel systems on the buildings’ rooftops and the 30 year landscape carbon inventory principle of no disturbance as the carbon offset, the unused military campus will become a zero-carbon campus.

	abstract = {Purpose: Land is used and modified in its natural function for the cultivation of food and energy crops, for infrastructure and other production purposes. Despite their global significance, land use impacts are still rarely addressed, although methods for integrating land use into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the development and calculation of regionalized characterization factors based on the LANCA® (Land Use Indicator Value Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment) method to be integrated into LCA using a geo information system (GIS). Methods: With the publication of the LANCA® characterization factors (Bos et al. 2016), land use impacts can be assessed at the country level. However, soil parameters as well as climatic conditions change on a small scale and are very site-specific. Therefore, there is a need for regionalized characterization factors. After a literature review, we describe the development of the five LANCA® indicators. Afterwards we present the conceptual framework for the calculation of GIS-based characterization factors and apply this framework to two examples, the indicators of mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration. Finally, we apply the characterization factors in a case study. Results, application and discussion: The region-specific characterization factors are calculated in a GIS environment yielding a map with values for mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration per grid cell for various land use types. A case study shows that land use impacts fluctuate due to site-specific conditions such as pedological, topographical and climatic conditions. It can be shown that our calculation of regionalized characterization factors in global maps is feasible and facilitates an area’s potential for causing lower environmental impacts for a certain land use compared to other areas. Remaining challenges are related to input data quality, the comprehensibility of the results to practitioners that are not land use experts and the technical restrictions of LCA database and software providers. Conclusions: Through the presented regionalization of the LANCA® framework, a necessary prerequisite to method advancement is met as also region-specific characterization factors can now be calculated. In comparison to the published country-specific characterization factors in Bos et al. (2016), the developed regional GIS-based characterization factors are far more advantageous especially for large countries. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that an LCA including the evaluation of land use does not replace methods and tools like environmental impact assessment. When deciding on a preferable location for a specific land use nature conservation, geographical, geological and building law aspects must also be taken into account. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases are essential to evaluate the environmental burden of a product or service using life cycle assessment (LCA). The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods. For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively, around 60% and 80% of variations within the datasets are explained by MLM, and 86.1% and 96.8% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3% and 70.5% when traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95% prediction intervals cover more than 95% of measurement data in both input cases. It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Building Information Modeling (BIM) has made remarkable research progress in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. We extend its application to offshore wind farms for their life cycle management to realize the structural optimization design, construction process simulation, operation and maintenance data monitoring and disassembly, etc. Our research begins with the review of the research situation of each stage in the life cycle of offshore wind farms to conclude the key technologies and obstacles. Then the successful application outcomes and potential value of BIM are synthesized to analyze its necessities, possibilities and feasibilities for the application in offshore wind farms. Finally, the application framework of BIM for offshore wind farms is established to facilitate the life cycle management, including the aspects of schedule, cost, quality and disaster risk assessment based on integrated data from digital models, databases, structures, marine environments and geographic information systems. This paper systematically analyzes the value of BIM technology in the life cycle management of offshore wind farms, which is of great significance to expand the application of BIM in the field of marine engineering and also behaves as the fundamental research for the next generation of digital and smart sustainable offshore wind farms. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research presents a methodology to characterize life cycle impact data (LCIA) of alternative construction materials outside of the European context. Methods: This methodology was based on the characterization of data and life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS), which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose. The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national transport at the country level; and local, represented by external factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m2 core shelter unit consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material: bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions’ variability and uncertainty analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed, and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed. Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for each country. Results and discussion: The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the construction materials’ transport distance. Therefore, the level of impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be achieved with low environmental impacts. Conclusions: The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately represent the range of production practices used outside Europe. Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design and recognising the structural needs in specific locations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction, which generates approximately 33% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and contributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present, interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact. Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75% of carbon emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement routes were located according to the types of transport used and the location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level. The impact of the building in the production, construction, de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use of the three tools - LCA, BIM and GIS - allowed us to establish that the highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix, which contribute to the sustainable development of the city. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to argue that it is possible to identify a number of physical design properties of plots that are associated with coastal alteration and to develop a predictive model or metric to evaluate the potential alteration caused by that resort. Investors may have economic plot size concerns not considered by planners, tourists may prefer close proximity to deep waters, and urban planners may have failed to realize the importance of certain plot ratios or minimum dimensions etc. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of geographical information system and statistical tools is used to identify and model these properties. The research uses data from three different resorts in two countries along the Red Sea coast (Hurghada and Safaga in Egypt and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia). Landsat TM7 images are obtained for each location and analysed to detect regions with the largest alteration along the coast using the post-classification change technique. Physical properties of each village are generated using ArcGIS 9.2 both before and after alteration. Finally, a predictive decision-support tool for urban planners and environmental auditors is formulated using stepwise discriminant analysis. Findings: Two-step cluster analysis and discriminate analysis show that alteration takes place based on factors that include original width and original distance to deep water in three distinct groups. The predictive model that is developed classifies any given resort into one of three clusters, by virtue of their physical design characteristics. This gives a rough prediction of the likely alteration that might take place under a given condition. Subdivision plans that ignore the power of these two factors literally invite owners to violate shorelines and encroach on the sea. Planners are urged to join hands with policy makers and developers to formulate guidelines to plot subdivision and environmentally acceptable design solutions to facilitate access to deep water. Originality/value: Till now, there has been no metric to relate a plot's geometric properties with the encroachment it makes. If such an association could be made, a developer's resort plans may be evaluated to predict the degree by which an encroachment is likely. The model can be used to identify resorts whose properties present a risk to shorelines, dredge or fill to maximize usable land. Two benefits may be thought of for this approach. First, the model helps urban planners develop a sustainable coastal area by bearing in mind the needs of tourist-developers as well as the properties of their adjacent coast. Second, the factors can be used to rationalize building guidelines and land use regulations to minimize such risk. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The urban context is highly relevant to assess the environmental impact of the end-of-life stage of buildings and potential for future reduction to properly design corresponding demolition waste management strategies. The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management strategies. The methodology combines a bottom-up material stock model based on geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial–temporal database with life cycle assessment (LCA) for the evaluation of end-of-life scenarios. The approach was tested for the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) and provided significant results on the quantity and the composition of the housing material stock. Two alternative scenarios involving recycling rates of respectively 50% and 70% for inert materials were assessed and an average reduction potential of 25.6% on abiotic depletion potential and 9.2% on global warming potential was estimated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The retrofitting of less energy efficient building stock represents one of the most significant challenges in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Nowadays, the housing sector represents about 40% of the energy consumption in the European Union. In this regard, the level of insulation installed in buildings is directly related to the energy efficiency of the building, and consequently to the urban area. In addition, several studies have shown that a comprehensive perspective of energy efficiency is needed, together with calculating the importance of introducing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to: first, measure the energy efficiency level of specific urban areas and their buildings using a geospatial model in an integral perspective; and second, the environmental impact caused by the refurbishment of these building façades using a LCA method. On the one hand, according to a bottom-up framework the quantitative and qualitative characterisation of the building stock façade at the urban scale is possible generating a georeferenced spatial data model of buildings using Geographic Information Systems. On the other hand, the environmental impact of the most usual constructive solutions to refurbishment building façades is calculated using the LCA methodology. The results obtained are merged and interpolated to the urban scale. The methodology is tested for the case study of blocks of flats in Barcelona using the open data of building stock from the Spanish Government. Firstly, this methodology provides more information in regard to urban areas as well as calculating their energy efficiency. Secondly, the study measures the renovation impact of the less efficient buildings. Finally, the results provide the basis for supporting decisions on building stock retrofitting for urban scale from a new approach, especially making the selection between various renovation scenarios much clearer. © 2017 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time, improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi-information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77 kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively, with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11%, while the transportation and construction phases contribute 3.30% and 0.59% of the total emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of prefabricated construction can lead to a 31.62% reduction in total GHG emissions per square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings. These findings can serve as practical references for future research to achieve the construction industry's green and low-carbon goals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major contributor towards climate change and given that the construction industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the context of developing countries. This research presents a novel framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize construction’s design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses. Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the results show that 29.35% of the materialization stage, 16.04% of the operational stage, and 21.14% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective environmental impacts. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Archetyping is a method for developing representative models of groups of buildings or infrastructure assets that share similar attributes. They typically focus on buildings and often support a single assessment method, such as urban building energy modelling, regardless of other significant flows (e.g. materials). Simplifications in developing archetypes and the inability to represent the distribution of flows across scales of the built environment reduce the precision of a model, which is critical in conducting a robust assessment that yields useful results. This paper aims to present an archetyping approach that supports an integrated life cycle assessment and material flow analysis of stock assets. As such, developed archetypes represent buildings, infrastructure, vegetation and soils. Built assets are defined as nested sets of assemblies, elements and materials. To improve reliability, we couple material compositions with geometrical data through the use of geographic information systems. We present the procedure for defining archetypes, and apply it to a building and transport infrastructure asset. The high resolution of the proposed archetyping approach enables a very high data granularity. This granularity enables a more detailed modelling of different scenarios, as well as dynamic life cycle assessment, and provides a high spatial resolution. © 2022 and published by the Architectural Science Association (ANZAScA).},

	abstract = {Urban building-stocks are responsible for a significant share of resource and energy use. To quantify the potential for reducing energy and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until 2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings of up to 23% and a corresponding 31% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand are offset by up to 65% by accounting for material use due to construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point indicators used. © 2019 The Authors},
