The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona, Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for designing REC, the optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE = 0.044 $/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction of 85.04% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE = 0.220 $/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in environmental impact of 54.59% compared to the base case. Overall, the developed data-driven provides policy decision-making with an evaluation of REC in the residential sector. © 2024 The Authors","Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine learning; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Optimization","Spain; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Housing; Investments; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Energy; Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine-learning; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimisations; alternative energy; environmental impact; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; parameter estimation; spatiotemporal analysis; Life cycle","European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2021-123511OB-C31, PID2021-123511OB-C33, PID2021-124139NB-C22, PID2021-127713OA-I00, TED2021-129851B-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the “ Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades ” of Spain ( PID2021-127713OA-I00 , PID2021-123511OB-C31 , PID2021-123511OB-C33 , PID2021-124139NB-C22 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/FEDER, UE & TED2021-129851B-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the “European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR).","D.

Methods proposed by these studies usually require not only specific accounting model, but also detailed inventory data, which is not available at early design stage. Seeing that the importance of design phase to carbon emissions during building's lifecycle, a study on regression model of carbon emissions using designing factors was done. Firstly, based on process analysis method, the carbon emissions of 207 residential buildings in Tianjin were calculated. The results show that annual carbon emissions per floor area are between 30 and 60 kgCO2/(m2•year), with manufacture phase and operation phase accounting for 11%–25% and 75%–87%, respectively. Then, correlation analysis and elastic net were used to determine 12 designing factors for predictive model; At last, four regression techniques, PCR, RF, MLP and SVR were used to develop regression models, respectively; comparison and process analysis of model development were given later. The results show that SVR has the optimal predictive accuracy among four models, its corresponding coefficient of determination can reach to 0.800. This regression model can be utilized to estimate carbon emissions based on designing factors, which can help designers make a strategic decision at early stage. © 2019","Building lifecycle; Carbon emissions; Predictive model; Residential building","Carbon; Ecodesign; Housing; Life cycle; Regression analysis; Building life cycle; Carbon emissions; Coefficient of determination; Correlation analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Predictive modeling; Regression techniques; Residential building; Structural design","Hebei Institutions of Higher Education; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2016YFC0700201); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province, (QN2019187); Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0700201) and Science and Technology Research Programs of the Hebei Institutions of Higher Education (QN2019187).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0700201 ) and Science and Technology Research Programs of the Hebei Institutions of Higher Education (QN2019187).

A current research trend is to integrate Building Material Stock (BMS) analysis with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate energy use, material stock/flows, and related environmental performance associated with the life cycle of building stocks. Compared with urban building energy modelling (UBEM), material-related analysis is a relatively new topic. Some studies applied new techniques and tools to improve the modelling and the dynamic evolution of the BMS system. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review studies summarising the recent publications on these applications. Therefore, this study conducts a comprehensive literature review, primarily focusing on examining the tools and techniques employed for integrating “BMS-LCA” at the urban scale. This review includes 99 articles chosen from a pool of 557 related papers (in the recent decade), systematically retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science, along with additional manual searches. Through a comprehensive bibliometric and content-based synthesis analysis of selected literature, this paper synthesises the techniques/tools used for effectively completing various analysis phases of “BMS-LCA”, including data collection and processing, stock modelling and analysis, and result evaluations. Key findings highlight the significance of integrating artificial intelligence and geospatial technology in optimising data collection, machine learning and data-driven models in enhancing building stock aggregation and classification, and innovative application of relevant LCA software and databases in facilitating BMS's LCA, etc. This review provides a valuable reference for researchers in future investigations, as it identifies novel ways of applying techniques/tools and opportunities for methodology improvement in the urban-level “BMS-LCA” study. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock modelling; Material flow analysis; Material stock quantification; Systematic literature review","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Data handling; Environmental management; Building stock modeling; Building stocks; Buildings materials; Material stock quantification; Materials flow analysis; Stock analysis; Stock models; Systematic literature review; Techniques and tools; Urban scale; construction material; future prospect; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; literature review; material flow analysis; performance assessment; quantitative analysis; research work; urban area; Life cycle","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; China Scholarship Council, CSC","The research was conducted at the Future Cities Lab Global at the Singapore-ETH Centre, which was established collaboratively between ETH Zurich and the National Research Foundation Singapore.

An estimation of the building's life span is essential to carrying out these methods. However, given the diverse factors that affect the building's life span, it was estimated typically based on its main structural type. However, different buildings have different life spans. Simply assuming that all buildings with the same structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning. The prediction models examined in this study produced root mean square errors of 3.72–4.6 and the coefficients of determination of 0.932–0.955. Among those models, a deep-learning based prediction model was found the most powerful. As anticipated, the conventional method of determining a building's life expectancy using a discrete set of specific factors and associated assumptions of life span did not yield realistic results. This study demonstrates that an application of deep learning to the LCA and LCC of a building is a promising direction, effectively guiding business planning and critical decision making throughout the construction process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Building life span; Deep neural network; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine learning","South Korea; Big data; Buildings; Construction; Costs; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Planning; Building construction; Building life span; Economic feasibilities; Environmental feasibility; Estimation errors; Life span; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Prediction model; Structural type; artificial neural network; building; cost analysis; data set; life cycle analysis; machine learning; prediction; Life cycle","","","M.Y.

The construction of the Jin Mao Tower 20 years ago was unique for several reasons and ideas have resulted in progress toward those goals. At the time, it was the tallest building in China, one that resulted in re-writing the Chinese code for wind and seismic engineering but perhaps most importantly inspired the design of other buildings that would incorporate resilient systems. These systems have been designed based on a platform of thinking related to lifecycle engineering and minimal impact on the environment. Clearly conceived efficient tall building structural systems based on mega-columns interconnected with cores, friction-fused seismic systems, the application of optimization theories, and the considerations of carbon in construction were all influenced by the design of the Jin Mao Tower. The paper and presentation will focus from research to build work that incorporate these ideas with visions of future opportunities. Project examples from around the world will be highlighted including the Jin Mao Tower – Shanghai, the Tianjin World Financial Headquarters, the Huawei Headquarters, the Poly Beijing Headquarters, Beijing Finance Street among others.

The fully self-centering behavior effectively eliminates the residual deformation, thereby improving the post-earthquake repairability of building structures. However, this behavior does intensify floor acceleration responses that contribute to nonstructural damage and lead to increased initial costs. This research aims to develop a general machine learning and genetic algorithm-based framework for optimizing the design of self-centering building structures and to strike a balance between the initial costs and seismic losses by minimizing the overall life-cycle cost. The artificial neural network (ANN) based StructureNet model was developed for accelerating the calculation of life-cycle costs associated with self-centering structures. The genetic algorithm was adopted to determine the optimal design parameters for self-centering structures. The framework was applied to 8 design cases, with the analysis centering on two factors: the maximum allowable residual inter-story drift for controlling demolition and the initial construction cost of self-centering members. The study examined their influences on the optimization design results of self-centering building structures. The findings highlight a preference for a design approach that leans toward partially self-centering behavior as opposed to fully self-centering behavior, indicating the higher life-cycle benefits of partially self-centering behavior. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; Genetic algorithm; Life-cycle cost; Optimal design; Partially self-centering behavior; Self-centering","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Earthquakes; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Neural networks; Optimal systems; Seismic design; Building structure; Centering behavior; Initial costs; Life-cycle cost; Machine-learning; Optimal design; Partially self-centering behavior; Self centering; Self-centering system; Genetic algorithms","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: The first author (Dr. Shuling Hu) would like to thank Prof. Songye Zhu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for his kind and professional support and help.

This is because AM has demonstrated impressive green characteristics which contributed to significantly reduced material and energy consumptions, a shorter supply chain, and diversion of the waste stream by reparation, etc. The majority of the current quantitative studies on the environmental assessment of AM are based on utilizing the knowledge-intensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Further, current studies on assessing the environmental performance of AM are based on a limited selection of design- or process-related parameters. These knowledge barriers may cause delays and challenges in the selection of the optimal design and process parameters for additively manufactured parts. Such challenges are particularly prevalent during the product design and planning stages due to the iterative design-evaluation process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated LCA tool to support AM toward elevated sustainability. As such, this paper provides three main contributions to the research community. Firstly, this is the first study to identify a comprehensive set of influential AM design and process parameters that pose an impact on the environmental performance of AM. Secondly, this review also summarizes the impacts of each of these parameters on the environmental sustainability of AM. Lastly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no work in the literature has been reported on automating LCA for AM. Thus, this paper promotes research toward a more environmentally benign and innovative AM technology by proposing a new framework to automate the environmental assessment of the process. The proposed framework is anticipated to take advantage of the fruitful integration between Machine Learning (ML) and the product process co-design concept to mitigate the challenges and limitations associated with the current LCA-based assessment tools. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Data-driven predictive model; Design and process parameters; Design for additive manufacturing; Life cycle assessment; Machine learning; Product-process co-design","3D printing; Additives; Carbon footprint; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Pollution control; Product design; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Co-designs; Data driven; Data-driven predictive model; Design for additive manufacturing; Design parameters; Life cycle assessment; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Process parameters; Product process; Product-process co-design; Life cycle","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2022-03448); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The study was supported by funding from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant ( RGPIN-2022-03448 ).

Network slicing orchestration architectures available in state-of-the-art have building blocks that structurally change depending on the problem they are trying to solve. In these orchestrators, life-cycle functions of network slices experience advances on numerous fronts, such as combinatorial methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, many of the state-of-the-art slicing architectures are not AI-native, making heterogeneity and the coexistence and use of machine learning paradigms for network slicing orchestration hard. Also, using AI in a non-native way makes network slice management a challenger and shallow. Hence, this paper proposes and evaluates a distributed AI-native slicing orchestration architecture that delivers machine learning capabilities in all life cycles of a network slice. Carried experiments suggest lower error using distributed machine learning models to predict Radio Access Network (RAN) resource consumption in slicing deployed over different target domains. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Machine learning; Network architecture; Radio access networks; Building blockes; Combinatorial method; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; Learning paradigms; Life-cycle functions; Machine-learning; Network infrastructure; Network slicing; Non-native; State of the art; Life cycle","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2018/23097-3); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (421944/2021-8, CNPq/MCTI/FNDCT 18/2021)","Acknowledgements.

The construction of the Jin Mao Tower 20 years ago was unique for several reasons and ideas have resulted in progress toward those goals. At the time, it was the tallest building in China, one that resulted in re-writing the Chinese code for wind and seismic engineering but perhaps most importantly inspired the design of other buildings that would incorporate resilient systems. These systems have been designed based on a platform of thinking related to life-cycle engineering and minimal impact on the environment. Clearly conceived efficient tall building structural systems based on mega-columns interconnected with cores, friction-fused seismic systems, the application of optimization theories, and the considerations of carbon in construction were all influenced by the design of the Jin Mao Tower. This paper focuses on issues from research to build work that incorporate these ideas with visions of future opportunities. Techniques of calculating carbon will be discussed and ideas for the future contemplated considering machine learning and self-sustainability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental impact; life-cycle; optimization; resilience; seismic design; Sustainable structural design; tall buildings","Architectural design; Carbon; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Seismology; Site selection; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Building structural; Chinese codes; Embodied carbons; Green Building Council; Impact on the environment; Life cycle engineering; Optimisations; Resilience; Resilient systems; Sustainable structural design; Seismic design","","","M.P.

The authors propose a comprehensive and generalizable framework for developing facility LCC analysis machine learning models. This framework specifies the data requirements, methods, and expected results in each step of the model development process. First, a literature review and a questionnaire survey were conducted to determine the independent variables affecting facility LCC and to identify the potential data sources. The process of using raw data to derive LCC components is then discussed. Finally, a proof-of-concept case study was conducted on a university campus to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework.

The methodology used is based upon selection of publications and analysis. Regarding LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available. LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decision-making. However, it is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids, AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are important.

However, existing methods for estimating WLCE are time-consuming and data-intensive, limiting their usefulness in the early building design stages. In response to this, this research introduces a novel approach by harnessing various machine learning algorithms to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity (normalised by floor area) for buildings. To evaluate the suitability of machine learning algorithms, we conducted an experiment involving ten algorithms to build the prediction models. These models were trained using data from 150 typical residential properties in Cornwall, UK, along with 28 features obtained from a comprehensive survey, including floor area, heating type, and occupant characteristics. The ten algorithms include Multiple Linear Regression, and non-linear algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest. Performance evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), means squared error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and elapsed time, were employed. Our research contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting building WLCE. We reveal that all the tested machine learning algorithms have the capability to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity, non-linear models outperform linear ones, and the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This research encourages the integration of life cycle studies into the early design stage, even within tight building design schedules, offering practical guidance to architects and designers. Furthermore, these results also benefit a wide range of stakeholders, not only the architects but also the engineers, policymakers, and life cycle assessment (LCA) researchers, contributing to the advancement of data-driven sustainability approaches within the building sector. © 2023 The Authors","Carbon reduction; Data-driven approaches; Life cycle thinking; Machine learning algorithms; Sustainable building; Whole life carbon emissions","Cornwall; Architectural design; Binary alloys; Carbon; Decision trees; Environmental impact; Errors; Forecasting; Housing; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Mean square error; Multiple linear regression; Sustainable development; Building design; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Cornwall; Data-driven approach; Life cycle thinking; Machine learning algorithms; Property; Sustainable building; Whole life carbon emission; algorithm; architectural design; carbon emission; environmental impact; heating; life cycle analysis; machine learning; sustainability; Floors","England European Regional Development Fund, (05R16P00305, 05R18P02819); University of Exeter; China Scholarship Council, CSC","Lin Zheng would like to acknowledge the financial support for her PhD from the China Scholarship Council and the University of Exeter .

During their lifespans, buildings consume embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE). Building professionals, therefore, conduct life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) to quantify and understand the paradox and interconnectedness between EE and OE. Traditionally, simulation-based optimization techniques were used for design space exploration to identify a building design with the fewest energy implications. However, literature shows these data-driven approaches are often error-prone, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, and they fail to provide real-time feedback to the user. Moreover, EE and OE assessment tools are disjointed and suffer from interoperability issues. These limitations restrict design space exploration, which eventually hinders the design decision-making process. Over the last few years, the increased availability of building data has made machine learning (ML) techniques a popular choice for building performance assessments. Several articles have developed prediction models to assess or optimize OE. While this work is significant, studies utilizing ML techniques for building LCEA are lacking, mainly due to the unavailability of a large-scale LCEA database. In this paper, we propose a methodology to (1) generate a simulation-based building energy dataset for different building typologies using a parametric framework, (2) utilize the synthetically generated database to develop an ML-based prediction model to predict EE and OE, and (3) test the model using a case study. The case study results show that the model achieves high prediction performance using minimal inputs available during the early design phase. The results further indicate that ML techniques can be used by building designers with no or limited LCE expertise to instantaneously estimate building LCE performance and help them select design options with minimal LCE consumption. © 2023","Building life cycle energy assessment; Building load prediction; Building performance analysis; Embodied energy; Life cycle energy; Machine learning; Operating energy; Supervised learning","Architectural design; Construction industry; Decision making; Forecasting; Life cycle; Optimization; Statistical tests; Structural design; Supervised learning; Building life cycle; Building life cycle energy assessment; Building load; Building load prediction; Building performance analysis; Embodied energy; Energy assessment; Life cycle energies; Load predictions; Machine-learning; Operating energies; Carbon footprint","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2048093)","This material is based upon work partly supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2048093.

Buildings consume both embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE) during their life cycle. EE is consumed by processes associated with construction, whereas OE is spent operating the building. Studies show that improving the operational efficiency of a building may have serious implications for EE. Building life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) is, therefore, essential to understanding the dichotomy between EE and OE. In recent years, increased availability and accessibility of large-scale data have made data-driven approaches a popular choice for building performance assessments. In this context, numerous review articles have highlighted and tracked current trends in building load prediction methods. While this work is significant, there remains a lack of reviews focusing on data-driven approaches from a building life cycle energy perspective. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of literature to identify key factors hindering the application of machine learning techniques specifically for building LCEA. They include: (i) issues of data collection, quality, and availability; (ii) lack of standardized methodologies; and (iii) temporal representativeness and granularity of prediction. Finally, we discuss potential solutions, future directions, and research opportunities for data-driven LCEA research. © 2022","Building energy modelling; Building load prediction; Challenges; Data-driven; Embodied energy; Life cycle energy; Machine learning; Operating energy","Construction; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Life cycle; Machine learning; Building energy model; Building load; Building load prediction; Challenge; Data driven; Embodied energy; Life cycle energies; Load predictions; Machine-learning; Operating energies; Buildings","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2048093)","This study was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant number 2048093.

Nonetheless, enhancing PV self-consumption through technical solutions such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is getting higher importance to increase the profitability of PV plants, by minimizing the building-grid interaction. In this context, analyzing PV self-consumption of different energy storage configurations becomes more relevant and crucial in building energy modeling although it is heavily time-consuming and complicated, particularly within a multi-objective optimization related to the ESS design. As a solution to resolve this issue, this paper evaluates the accuracy, training, and prediction speed of 24 Machine Learning (ML) models to be used as surrogate models for analyzing PV self-consumption in smart buildings. Furthermore, the performance of short-term Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to increase PV self-consumption is assessed and presented using ML models. The results showed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Networks (NN) including bilayered and trilayered NN models, Support Vector Machines (SVM) including the fine gaussian and cubic SVM models, and Ensembles of Trees (EoT) as superior ML models. The results also revealed that TES systems can efficiently increase PV self-consumption in the building equipped with electric heat pumps to provide heating, cooling, and domestic hot water. Moreover, the TES size optimization regarding the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) showed that the LCC-based optimum TES size can yield 7.1% savings within 30 years of the building service life. The novelties of this research are first to provide a reference to select the most suitable ML models in predicting PV self-consumption, second to implement machine learning for analyzing the performance of short-term thermal energy storage to enhance PV self-consumption in buildings, and third to carry out an LCC-based optimization on TES size using ML-based prediction models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Accuracy; LCC; Machine learning; Prediction; PV self-consumption; Thermal energy storage","Buildings; Cooling systems; Costs; Heat storage; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Support vector machines; Thermal energy; Accuracy; In-buildings; Life cycle cost; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Photovoltaic self-consumption; Photovoltaics; Storage systems; Thermal energy storage; accuracy assessment; building; cost analysis; energy storage; life cycle analysis; machine learning; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; prediction; Forecasting","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (768921)","This study and project are financially supported by EU Research and Innovation programme Horizon 2020 through number 768921 – HEART.

One of the challenges usually faced by an organization's capital planning department and/or facility management department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the programming phase when no building design is available. To provide facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to predict facilities' LCC - initial design and construction cost, utility cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using data provided by building systems. The corresponding domain ontology - LCCA-Onto - is also presented. The proposed approach provides organizations who own multiple facilities with an innovative solution to the LCC prediction issue. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Construction; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Forecasting; Life cycle; Machine learning; Office buildings; Ontology; Predictive analytics; Turing machines; Analysis frameworks; Building Information Model - BIM; Building life cycle; Facility management; Innovative solutions; Multiple buildings; Multiple facilities; Operation and maintenance; Architectural design","","","","Tang P.; Grau D.; El Asmar M.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","978-078448286-5","","","English","Constr.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a viable method for this purpose. However, its high granularity, and subsequent data requirements and effort, hinder its propagation, and potential employment of Machine Learning (ML) applications on a larger scale. The presented paper outlines the current state of research and practice on district-scale building LCA in terms of standards, software and certifications, and data availability. For this matter, the authors present the development and application of two district-scale LCA tools, Teco and DisteLCA, to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of three different residential districts. Both tools employ data based on (including, but not limited to) CityGML, TABULA, and ÖKOBAUDAT. The results indicate that DisteLCA’s granular approach leads to an overestimation of environmental impacts, which can be derived from the statistical approach to operational energy use and related emissions. While both tools lead to substantial time savings, Teco requires less manual effort. The linkage of the aforementioned data sources has proven laborious and could be alleviated with a common data framework. Furthermore, large-scale data analysis could substantially increase the viability of the presented approach. © 2023 by the authors.","CityGML; global warming potential (GWP); life cycle assessment (LCA); reduced-order modelling (ROM); urban building energy modelling (UBEM)","Buildings; Data reduction; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Building energy model; CityGML; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Reduced-order modeling; Urban building energy modeling; Urban buildings; Life cycle","","","J.

This study systematically surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153 papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others. Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building science, computing science, data science, and social science. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Building control; Building life cycle; Building performance; Buildings; Machine learning","Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Construction industry; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Green computing; Labeled data; Learning systems; Life cycle; Social computing; Social sciences computing; Structural design; Building controls; Building life cycle; Building performance; Fault detection and diagnosis; Machine learning research; Model transferabilities; Multi-disciplinary approach; Research and application; Machine learning","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); Office of Science, SC; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","This work was supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 .","T.

Life cycle Inventory Assessment is one of the main stages of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it is a methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts of buildings and other assets on the environment. We propose a literature review for examining the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the LCA of buildings. In particular, by incorporating AI into the process, it is checked that more accurate predictive modelling is enabled and the time needed for data gathering can be reduced. However, it is also noted that many challenges remain and must be still addressed, such as the need for standardized data and the risk of bias in AI algorithms. Despite these latter open challenges, it can be concluded that AI can significantly enhance sustainability in the building sector. Highlights Potential for AI to improve the life cycle assessment of buildings and reduce the time needed for data gathering. AI can significantly enhance sustainability in the building sector, but there are still open challenges that must be addressed. The use of AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, for data collection can help gather more accurate and relevant data for LCI. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence (AI); buildings; environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; renewable energy; sustainability","Artificial intelligence; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Artificial intelligence; Building life cycle; Buildings sector; Data gathering; Energy; Environmental damage; In-buildings; Life cycle assessment; Life Cycle Inventory; Renewable energies; Buildings","","","S.

Our work has been limited to DDoS attack detection techniques. We propose to extend our framework to general ML system development, based on our review of current ML system development life cycles. We also propose to augment the general life cycle model to include security features to enable building security-in as the development progresses and bolt security-on as flaws are discovered after deployment. Most ML systems today operate in a black-box mode, providing users with only the predictions without associated reasoning as to how the predictions are brought about. There is heavy emphasis now to build mechanisms that help the user develop higher confidence in accepting the predictions of ML systems. Such explainability feature of ML model predictions is a must for critical systems. We also propose to augment our lifecycle model with explainability features. Thus, our ultimate goal is to develop a generic ML lifecycle process augmented with security and explainability features. Such an ML lifecycle process will be of immense use in ML systems development for all domains.  © 2021 IEEE.","Explanation augmented ML life cycle; Machine learning life cycle; MLOpS; Security augmented ML life cycle","Computer aided instruction; Denial-of-service attack; Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Application Lifecycle; Distributed denial of service; Explanation augmented ML life cycle; Life cycle model; Life-cycle process; Machine learning applications; Machine learning life cycle; MLOpS; Security augmented ML life cycle; System development; Life cycle","U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS; Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT","This work was partially supported by a DHS/AFIT grant.

Since the number of products in a company's portfolio can include thousands of different products, there is an urgent need for faster ways to estimate impact hotspots and to ultimately obtain adequate inventories. In recent years machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising strategy to tackle cost- and resource-prohibitive accounting practices. However, to be practically applied, new concepts must not only be built on a large data basis allowing to predict diverse products with varying reference flows, but they must also ensure high data quality by reflecting different types of uncertainties. Therefore, in this publication we pursued three distinct objectives: building on digitized environmental product declarations, we first predicted life cycle environmental impacts with artificial neural networks (ANN) and second performed an in-depth characterization of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods to identify which methods can analyze what uncertainty types. Based on this analysis, we chose residual Gaussian Process Regression (rGPR) as suitable uncertainty analysis method and employed, in a third step, an advanced ANN-rGPR hybrid model to quantify associated model uncertainties. While our final model derived high prediction performances and low model uncertainties across a large impact range, we conclude that the practical use of ML-based predictions remains limited, as long as reported product disclosures lack critical modeling specifications. However, if future reporting requirements comprehensively demanded such information, ML models could conceptually incorporate this information, thereby not only substantially improving the data quality but also the feasibility of practical implementation. © 2024 The Authors","Artificial neural network; Environmental product declaration; Greenhouse gas accounting; Machine learning; Prediction; Uncertainty analysis","Analysis method; Data quality; Environmental product declarations; Gaussian process regression; Greenhouse gas accountings; Life-cycle environmental impact; Machine-learning; Modeling uncertainties; Neural-networks; Uncertainty; Life cycle assessment","Merck Sustainability Hub; Naeem Adibi and Carolina Szablewski Colli","The research of TU Darmstadt was conducted within the Merck Sustainability Hub 2021\u20132023, a joint research platform of Merck and TU Darmstadt.

Architectural design decisions play a critical role in a building’s carbon footprint, making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design. © 2024 by the authors.","architectural design; architecture; building information modeling; carbon footprint; large language models; machine learning","Carbon footprint; Computational linguistics; Construction industry; Decision making; Digital devices; Emission control; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Artificial intelligence tools; Building Information Modelling; Case-studies; Digital tools; Language model; Large language model; Life-cycle assessment tools; Low carbon; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Architectural design","","","M.
