The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona, Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for designing REC, the optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE = 0.044 $/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction of 85.04% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE = 0.220 $/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in environmental impact of 54.59% compared to the base case. Overall, the developed data-driven provides policy decision-making with an evaluation of REC in the residential sector. © 2024 The Authors","Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine learning; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Optimization","Spain; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Housing; Investments; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Energy; Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine-learning; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimisations; alternative energy; environmental impact; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; parameter estimation; spatiotemporal analysis; Life cycle","European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2021-123511OB-C31, PID2021-123511OB-C33, PID2021-124139NB-C22, PID2021-127713OA-I00, TED2021-129851B-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the “ Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades ” of Spain ( PID2021-127713OA-I00 , PID2021-123511OB-C31 , PID2021-123511OB-C33 , PID2021-124139NB-C22 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/FEDER, UE & TED2021-129851B-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the “European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR).","D.

Methods proposed by these studies usually require not only specific accounting model, but also detailed inventory data, which is not available at early design stage. Seeing that the importance of design phase to carbon emissions during building's lifecycle, a study on regression model of carbon emissions using designing factors was done. Firstly, based on process analysis method, the carbon emissions of 207 residential buildings in Tianjin were calculated. The results show that annual carbon emissions per floor area are between 30 and 60 kgCO2/(m2•year), with manufacture phase and operation phase accounting for 11%–25% and 75%–87%, respectively. Then, correlation analysis and elastic net were used to determine 12 designing factors for predictive model; At last, four regression techniques, PCR, RF, MLP and SVR were used to develop regression models, respectively; comparison and process analysis of model development were given later. The results show that SVR has the optimal predictive accuracy among four models, its corresponding coefficient of determination can reach to 0.800. This regression model can be utilized to estimate carbon emissions based on designing factors, which can help designers make a strategic decision at early stage. © 2019","Building lifecycle; Carbon emissions; Predictive model; Residential building","Carbon; Ecodesign; Housing; Life cycle; Regression analysis; Building life cycle; Carbon emissions; Coefficient of determination; Correlation analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Predictive modeling; Regression techniques; Residential building; Structural design","Hebei Institutions of Higher Education; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2016YFC0700201); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province, (QN2019187); Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0700201) and Science and Technology Research Programs of the Hebei Institutions of Higher Education (QN2019187).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0700201 ) and Science and Technology Research Programs of the Hebei Institutions of Higher Education (QN2019187).

This study investigated the life-cycle energy use of prefabricated components and the corresponding effect on the total embodied energy use for a number of real building projects. Result showed that the life-cycle energy use of prefabricated components ranged from 7.33 GJ/m3 for precast staircase to 13.34 GJ/m3 for precast form. The recycling process could achieve 16%-24% energy reduction. This study also found that apart from reusability, energy savings are also obtained from waste reduction and high quality control, saving 4%-14% of the total life-cycle energy consumption. All these advantages can be regarded as important environment friendly strategies provided by precast construction. The linear regression analysis indicated that the average increment in energy use was nearly linearly correlated with prefabrication rate. Precast facade and form are identified as energy-intensive components compared with the conventional construction method. Therefore, the challenge lies in improving the integrality and quality of the prefabrication technique while reducing its dependence on energy-intensive materials. Besides, attention should be focused on improving the maturity of the precast market to avoid additional energy consumption during prophase investigation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Data was collected from 44 non-residential buildings in Singapore constructed over the period for 1978-2013. The findings demonstrate that the annual average values of LCC, CC and OC of 44 projects in Singapore are 222.03 $/m2, 91.85 $/m2 and 130.18 $/m2 respectively. In regression analysis, the annual LCC and OC increase 47.81 $/m2 and 25.37 $/m2 as Green Mark improves a level.

An estimation of the building's life span is essential to carrying out these methods. However, given the diverse factors that affect the building's life span, it was estimated typically based on its main structural type. However, different buildings have different life spans. Simply assuming that all buildings with the same structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning. The prediction models examined in this study produced root mean square errors of 3.72–4.6 and the coefficients of determination of 0.932–0.955. Among those models, a deep-learning based prediction model was found the most powerful. As anticipated, the conventional method of determining a building's life expectancy using a discrete set of specific factors and associated assumptions of life span did not yield realistic results. This study demonstrates that an application of deep learning to the LCA and LCC of a building is a promising direction, effectively guiding business planning and critical decision making throughout the construction process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Building life span; Deep neural network; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine learning","South Korea; Big data; Buildings; Construction; Costs; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Planning; Building construction; Building life span; Economic feasibilities; Environmental feasibility; Estimation errors; Life span; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Prediction model; Structural type; artificial neural network; building; cost analysis; data set; life cycle analysis; machine learning; prediction; Life cycle","","","M.Y.

Using historical data on maintenance and repair over a 42-year period, a cost prediction model using the life-cycle cost (LCC) was determined using three different methods: (1) simple linear regression (SLR); (2) multiple regression (MR); and finally (3) a back propagation artificial neural network (BPN). The research results showed that the BPN model had good estimation ability.

The construction of the Jin Mao Tower 20 years ago was unique for several reasons and ideas have resulted in progress toward those goals. At the time, it was the tallest building in China, one that resulted in re-writing the Chinese code for wind and seismic engineering but perhaps most importantly inspired the design of other buildings that would incorporate resilient systems. These systems have been designed based on a platform of thinking related to lifecycle engineering and minimal impact on the environment.

The fully self-centering behavior effectively eliminates the residual deformation, thereby improving the post-earthquake repairability of building structures. However, this behavior does intensify floor acceleration responses that contribute to nonstructural damage and lead to increased initial costs. This research aims to develop a general machine learning and genetic algorithm-based framework for optimizing the design of self-centering building structures and to strike a balance between the initial costs and seismic losses by minimizing the overall life-cycle cost. The artificial neural network (ANN) based StructureNet model was developed for accelerating the calculation of life-cycle costs associated with self-centering structures. The genetic algorithm was adopted to determine the optimal design parameters for self-centering structures. The framework was applied to 8 design cases, with the analysis centering on two factors: the maximum allowable residual inter-story drift for controlling demolition and the initial construction cost of self-centering members. The study examined their influences on the optimization design results of self-centering building structures. The findings highlight a preference for a design approach that leans toward partially self-centering behavior as opposed to fully self-centering behavior, indicating the higher life-cycle benefits of partially self-centering behavior. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; Genetic algorithm; Life-cycle cost; Optimal design; Partially self-centering behavior; Self-centering","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Earthquakes; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Neural networks; Optimal systems; Seismic design; Building structure; Centering behavior; Initial costs; Life-cycle cost; Machine-learning; Optimal design; Partially self-centering behavior; Self centering; Self-centering system; Genetic algorithms","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: The first author (Dr. Shuling Hu) would like to thank Prof. Songye Zhu at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for his kind and professional support and help.

Network slicing orchestration architectures available in state-of-the-art have building blocks that structurally change depending on the problem they are trying to solve. In these orchestrators, life-cycle functions of network slices experience advances on numerous fronts, such as combinatorial methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, many of the state-of-the-art slicing architectures are not AI-native, making heterogeneity and the coexistence and use of machine learning paradigms for network slicing orchestration hard. Also, using AI in a non-native way makes network slice management a challenger and shallow. Hence, this paper proposes and evaluates a distributed AI-native slicing orchestration architecture that delivers machine learning capabilities in all life cycles of a network slice.

Several scenarios based on alternative energy efficiency measures were analyzed, and life cycle environmental and economic indicators were computed, i.e., global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED), and net present cost (NPC). The results demonstrated the close to negative linear regression between the environmental and economic indicators computed. However, the values of CED and GWP for the best scenarios in environmental terms were respectively 50% and 32% lower than the values of the worst scenarios, while their NPC was around 6% higher than the lowest values.

However, comprehensive research on the lifecycle carbon emissions of these materials remains scarce, plagued by issues of data uncertainty, accessibility, and scoping discrepancies. Therefore, a probabilistic lifecycle assessment approach was adopted in this study, enabling uncertainty analysis of the carbon emission intensity of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials. The findings indicate that the 10.5th percentile of the carbon emission intensity simulations for MPC stands at 0.624 kgCO2e/kg, suggesting that nearly 90% of the values surpass those of OPC, thereby refuting the presumption of its low-carbon attributes. Notably, the consumption and carbon emission factors of magnesium oxide and soluble phosphates emerge as pivotal influences on its carbon emissions. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was employed to forecast the correlation between the constituents of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials and the volume of carbon emissions.

The goal of this study was to propose a systematic approach to estimate service life of building products by including both technical and social factors. Methods A hybrid service life prediction method, combining the statistical approach described in American Society for Testing and Materials standard G166 with the Factor Method adopted by International Organization for Standardization standard 15686, was proposed. In their current forms, the two methods are not suitable to provide reliable lifetime estimates for the wide variety of products that are used in buildings. Statistical analysis was preferred over a deterministic approach. Regression analysis was used to define Weibull distribution parameters for each product. These distributions were then used to calculate the mean estimated service life of products with an 80% confidence interval. Using actual lifetime observed from practice instead of design lifetime for reference service life was preferred. This enables the use of a smaller range of coefficients for each factor affecting service life, which decreases subjectivity and increases reliability of results. Results and discussion Example median service life estimates were demonstrated for common residential interior finishes that are replaced more frequently, and therefore require more maintenance planning and potentially have significant environmental impacts. Probability of renovation distributions was also presented for interior finishes. The proposed method inherently includes social factors in the dataset used to define lifetime distributions, which could be as important as durability for some building product categories. Another advantage is that choosing reference service life based on real-life conditions decreases the range of coefficients necessary for modifying factors in comparison to when design lifetime is used, thus decreasing the subjectivity of results due to variations in assigned values by different users. Conclusions The Factor Method is the most promising method available to estimate service life of products. Unless additional data points were gathered for investigated products, the presented lifetime distribution results can be directly applied to LCA studies. The proposed hybrid method can also be applied to other products that are studied within the Factor Method. Products whose lifetimes are influenced by social factors are prime candidates to apply this method. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Factor method; Interior finish; Life cycle assessment; Residential building; Service life prediction","analytic method; article; building industry; building material; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; materials testing; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; prediction; priority journal; residential home; social aspect","","","C.B.

The relationship between exergy destruction and sustainable development were presented. The building life cycle cost and exergy consumption regression model were set up. The optimal building insulation level could be affected by whether cost minimization or exergy consumption minimization approach was used.

The method accounts for life cycle effects on cost and carbon emissions since refurbished buildings will last for many years. Four schools are identified as representative of school archetypes built in the UK during four distinct periods in the 20th century. The schools are used as a base for simulation of the effects of energy efficient refurbishment of building fabric and heating plant. All possible combinations of the selected measures are simulated. Simulated energy savings are then compared between the four school buildings, demonstrating how physical characteristics of the schools affect the available savings. Simulating combinations of energy efficiency measures allow analysis of interaction effects between measures, and reveals some positive and some negative interactions. A regression model of energy savings in the four schools is also developed. Simulated energy savings are then used as inputs for a life cycle assessment model. Life cycle indicators considered are marginal life cycle cost and marginal life cycle carbon footprint. These metrics are used to rank the energy efficiency measures on net present value and life cycle carbon footprint saving, both individually and in combination with each other. Carbon payback is shorter than financial payback in all scenarios, and all measures and combinations of measures repaid the carbon invested in them. Positive net present value is less common, and frequently depends on air tightness improvements also being achieved. © 2014","Building energy simulation; Energy efficiency; Life cycle carbon footprint; Life cycle cost; Refurbishment","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I02929X/1)","","J.

However, existing methods for estimating WLCE are time-consuming and data-intensive, limiting their usefulness in the early building design stages. In response to this, this research introduces a novel approach by harnessing various machine learning algorithms to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity (normalised by floor area) for buildings. To evaluate the suitability of machine learning algorithms, we conducted an experiment involving ten algorithms to build the prediction models. These models were trained using data from 150 typical residential properties in Cornwall, UK, along with 28 features obtained from a comprehensive survey, including floor area, heating type, and occupant characteristics. The ten algorithms include Multiple Linear Regression, and non-linear algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest. Performance evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), means squared error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and elapsed time, were employed. Our research contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting building WLCE. We reveal that all the tested machine learning algorithms have the capability to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity, non-linear models outperform linear ones, and the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This research encourages the integration of life cycle studies into the early design stage, even within tight building design schedules, offering practical guidance to architects and designers. Furthermore, these results also benefit a wide range of stakeholders, not only the architects but also the engineers, policymakers, and life cycle assessment (LCA) researchers, contributing to the advancement of data-driven sustainability approaches within the building sector. © 2023 The Authors","Carbon reduction; Data-driven approaches; Life cycle thinking; Machine learning algorithms; Sustainable building; Whole life carbon emissions","Cornwall; Architectural design; Binary alloys; Carbon; Decision trees; Environmental impact; Errors; Forecasting; Housing; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Mean square error; Multiple linear regression; Sustainable development; Building design; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Cornwall; Data-driven approach; Life cycle thinking; Machine learning algorithms; Property; Sustainable building; Whole life carbon emission; algorithm; architectural design; carbon emission; environmental impact; heating; life cycle analysis; machine learning; sustainability; Floors","England European Regional Development Fund, (05R16P00305, 05R18P02819); University of Exeter; China Scholarship Council, CSC","Lin Zheng would like to acknowledge the financial support for her PhD from the China Scholarship Council and the University of Exeter .

Such a scenario is encountered in several developing countries, but up to the author's knowledge, no previous study dealt with its detailed assessment and optimization. The problem formulation considers using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the cumulative environmental benefit (CEB) as two life-cycle conflicting objective functions. First, a multiple linear regression technique was developed to predict accurately the PV power generation under a time resolution of 15 min as recommended for PV-self consumption studies. A new mathematical expression was as well derived to calculate more accurately the CEB considering both the degradation of the PV productivity over the project lifetime and the dynamic evolution of the electricity mix of the country with respect to time. A Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to identify Pareto frontiers and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution “TOPSIS” decision-making method is employed to select the final optimum. The followed approach was applied for a large Moroccan commercial structure with an annual electric load of 2.932 GWh. It was found that the recommended optimum PV installed capacity is 847.4 kWp. This optimized design leads to the best compromise between economic and environmental aspects and the LCOE is 15.12 c$/kWh while the CEB is 7.89 tonnes CO2. The corresponding self-sufficiency and self-consumption ratios were estimated at 41.41% and 79.14%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Commercial buildings; multi-objective optimization; Multiple linear regression; PV-Self consumption; TOPSIS","Decision making; Developing countries; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Linear regression; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Conflicting objectives; Decision-making method; Environmental benefits; Levelized cost of electricities; Mathematical expressions; Multiple linear regressions; Solar photovoltaic system; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","J.

This study aims to identify the measures that can increase the adoption of LCA toward overcoming the practical difficulties, theoretical concerns and structural differences encountered in making gains in achieving sustainable practices in the SA construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a deductive research design using a questionnaire survey with mean scores, Kruskal–Wallis and least square regression analysis done. Findings: The study determined ten measures that can significantly influence about 88 per cent improvement in the success of LCA adopting in the SA industry. Also, there was a higher level of consensus in the findings which offers credence and good representation of the practical reality in the LCA adoption in South Africa. Originality/value: These measures could be seen to embrace behavioural, social, technical and policy dimensions of LCA adoption.

During their lifespans, buildings consume embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE). Building professionals, therefore, conduct life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) to quantify and understand the paradox and interconnectedness between EE and OE. Traditionally, simulation-based optimization techniques were used for design space exploration to identify a building design with the fewest energy implications. However, literature shows these data-driven approaches are often error-prone, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, and they fail to provide real-time feedback to the user. Moreover, EE and OE assessment tools are disjointed and suffer from interoperability issues. These limitations restrict design space exploration, which eventually hinders the design decision-making process. Over the last few years, the increased availability of building data has made machine learning (ML) techniques a popular choice for building performance assessments. Several articles have developed prediction models to assess or optimize OE. While this work is significant, studies utilizing ML techniques for building LCEA are lacking, mainly due to the unavailability of a large-scale LCEA database. In this paper, we propose a methodology to (1) generate a simulation-based building energy dataset for different building typologies using a parametric framework, (2) utilize the synthetically generated database to develop an ML-based prediction model to predict EE and OE, and (3) test the model using a case study. The case study results show that the model achieves high prediction performance using minimal inputs available during the early design phase. The results further indicate that ML techniques can be used by building designers with no or limited LCE expertise to instantaneously estimate building LCE performance and help them select design options with minimal LCE consumption. © 2023","Building life cycle energy assessment; Building load prediction; Building performance analysis; Embodied energy; Life cycle energy; Machine learning; Operating energy; Supervised learning","Architectural design; Construction industry; Decision making; Forecasting; Life cycle; Optimization; Statistical tests; Structural design; Supervised learning; Building life cycle; Building life cycle energy assessment; Building load; Building load prediction; Building performance analysis; Embodied energy; Energy assessment; Life cycle energies; Load predictions; Machine-learning; Operating energies; Carbon footprint","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2048093)","This material is based upon work partly supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2048093.

However, embodied carbon is often overlooked compared to the operational predictive model due to the complexity of collecting embodied data. Previous studies relied on basic parameters (i.e., GFA, storey, etc.) to quantify embodied carbon. This approach leads to uncertainty due to variations in building materials. Identifying material-specific parameters that contribute to the most embodied emissions is crucial to enhancing the prediction accuracy of regression models. Taking Malaysia's green-certified office buildings as a case study, this study aims to develop an integrated Life Cycle Assessment-Multiple Linear Regression (LCA-MLR) framework to establish hotspot-oriented regression models. Results show that cement and steel contribute two-thirds of embodied emissions and are adopted in the MLR model to predict embodied carbon. Hotspot-based embodied regression equations, formulated using material-specific parameters, enable accurate prediction with 23.7–42.1% variation compared to actual embodied emissions, while gross floor area and storey incur 90.6–93.4% and 99.7–99.9% variation, respectively. Using the hotspot-oriented regression models, a new Green Office Building Carbon Rating is established to benchmark the carbon performance of newly green buildings with the other existing green office buildings in Malaysia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon benchmarking; Embodied carbon; Green-certified office building; Life cycle assessment; Multiple linear regression; Operational carbon","Benchmarking; Carbon; Forecasting; Life cycle; Office buildings; Carbon benchmarking; Embodied carbons; Embodied emissions; Green office buildings; Green-certified office building; Hotspots; Life cycle assessment; Multiple linear regressions; Operational carbon; Regression modelling; Multiple linear regression","GreenRE Sdn Bhd and Xiamen University Malaysia, (XMUMRF/2019-C4/IENG/0022, XMUMRF/2023-C11/IENG/0057)","The authors would like to thank for the financial support from GreenRE Sdn Bhd and Xiamen University Malaysia Research Fund (XMUMRF/2019-C4/IENG/0022) and (XMUMRF/2023-C11/IENG/0057).

Nonetheless, enhancing PV self-consumption through technical solutions such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is getting higher importance to increase the profitability of PV plants, by minimizing the building-grid interaction. In this context, analyzing PV self-consumption of different energy storage configurations becomes more relevant and crucial in building energy modeling although it is heavily time-consuming and complicated, particularly within a multi-objective optimization related to the ESS design. As a solution to resolve this issue, this paper evaluates the accuracy, training, and prediction speed of 24 Machine Learning (ML) models to be used as surrogate models for analyzing PV self-consumption in smart buildings. Furthermore, the performance of short-term Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to increase PV self-consumption is assessed and presented using ML models. The results showed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Networks (NN) including bilayered and trilayered NN models, Support Vector Machines (SVM) including the fine gaussian and cubic SVM models, and Ensembles of Trees (EoT) as superior ML models. The results also revealed that TES systems can efficiently increase PV self-consumption in the building equipped with electric heat pumps to provide heating, cooling, and domestic hot water. Moreover, the TES size optimization regarding the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) showed that the LCC-based optimum TES size can yield 7.1% savings within 30 years of the building service life. The novelties of this research are first to provide a reference to select the most suitable ML models in predicting PV self-consumption, second to implement machine learning for analyzing the performance of short-term thermal energy storage to enhance PV self-consumption in buildings, and third to carry out an LCC-based optimization on TES size using ML-based prediction models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Accuracy; LCC; Machine learning; Prediction; PV self-consumption; Thermal energy storage","Buildings; Cooling systems; Costs; Heat storage; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Support vector machines; Thermal energy; Accuracy; In-buildings; Life cycle cost; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Photovoltaic self-consumption; Photovoltaics; Storage systems; Thermal energy storage; accuracy assessment; building; cost analysis; energy storage; life cycle analysis; machine learning; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; prediction; Forecasting","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (768921)","This study and project are financially supported by EU Research and Innovation programme Horizon 2020 through number 768921 – HEART.

One of the challenges usually faced by an organization's capital planning department and/or facility management department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the programming phase when no building design is available. To provide facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to predict facilities' LCC - initial design and construction cost, utility cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using data provided by building systems.

The prefabrication approach has been promoted and increasingly integrated into building engineering and construction, which has attracted increasing research into the life-cycle carbon assessment (LCCA) of prefabricated buildings. However, there exist challenges. This paper examines the challenges and, through rethinking their theoretical fundamentals, proposes solutions with the aim to enhance the reliability and validity of research into the LCCA of prefabricated buildings. The challenges are found to be implicit system boundaries of prefabrication and LCCA: inconsistent methods, models and units of analysis of estimating buildings' life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions and LCCA being a labour-intensive process with limited accountability. The proposed solutions are a regression model of relating buildings' LCCA to 12 system boundaries, expressed by the system boundaries' inconsistency ratio (I R), which shows the level of difference between any two system boundaries; a five-level framework of units of analysis consisting of material, component, assembly, flat and building; and a smart-technology-integrated approach for automatic LCCA. The solutions are important and timely to help reduce buildings' life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions effectively for achieving long-term sustainability of society. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","buildings, structures & design; energy; sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Regression analysis; Building construction; Building design; Building engineering; Building life cycle; Building structure; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy; Structure design; System boundary; Unit of analysis; Sustainable development","General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council, (17207115)","The work described in this paper was supported by a grant from the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Project Number 17207115).

Given that the building sector is one of the major sources of carbon emissions, results imperative to limit these emissions, especially in a city context where the density of buildings is commonly higher and rapidly increasing. All stages of the life cycle of a building, including raw material harvesting, manufacturing of products, use phase of the building, end of life, all generate or reduce carbon. The manufacture of construction materials accounts for 11% of all energy and process-related emissions annually. Additionally, recent estimates indicate that over 80% of all product-related environmental impacts of a building are determined during the design phase of the building. These indicators reflect the urgent need to explore a low-carbon measure method for building design. This is here done using a linear regression Reverse Engineering model and percentage calculation. One of the hypotheses formulated relates Global Warming Potential (GWP) of −30.000 CO2eq or lower (around −165 CO2eq/m2) in the 25% of a block of houses, to carbon further reductions by 11%.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a viable method for this purpose. However, its high granularity, and subsequent data requirements and effort, hinder its propagation, and potential employment of Machine Learning (ML) applications on a larger scale. The presented paper outlines the current state of research and practice on district-scale building LCA in terms of standards, software and certifications, and data availability. For this matter, the authors present the development and application of two district-scale LCA tools, Teco and DisteLCA, to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of three different residential districts. Both tools employ data based on (including, but not limited to) CityGML, TABULA, and ÖKOBAUDAT. The results indicate that DisteLCA’s granular approach leads to an overestimation of environmental impacts, which can be derived from the statistical approach to operational energy use and related emissions. While both tools lead to substantial time savings, Teco requires less manual effort. The linkage of the aforementioned data sources has proven laborious and could be alleviated with a common data framework. Furthermore, large-scale data analysis could substantially increase the viability of the presented approach. © 2023 by the authors.","CityGML; global warming potential (GWP); life cycle assessment (LCA); reduced-order modelling (ROM); urban building energy modelling (UBEM)","Buildings; Data reduction; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Global warming; Building energy model; CityGML; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Reduced-order modeling; Urban building energy modeling; Urban buildings; Life cycle","","","J.

Due to the negative environmental impact from fossil fuel, people are trying to use renewable energy resources to provide energy to the buildings. Integrated solar absorption cooling and heating (SACH) technology can be one of the promising solutions to this issue. Due to the nature of solar energy, integrated SACH has many drawbacks, such as discontinuity of generation, thus backup system driven by fossil fuel should be included to the system configuration as well. Therefore, optimization is highly required during the design stage. This paper presents the development of a method to optimize an integrated SACH system. Regression analysis is used to identify the relationship between the life cycle primary energy savings (PES) and the system factors according to the data provided by experiments. In order to obtain an accurate model to estimate the problem using small number of experimental trials, the method of central composite design (CCD) from design of experiments (DE) is used as a key technique. The experimental trials are conducted in TRaNsient SYstems Simulation (TRNSYS). Finally, the optimization problem is formulated and solved by including the model as the objective function and the physical constraints of the system factors. A case study was conducted to apply this optimization method to the design of an integrated SACH system installed in a medium-sized office building in Los Angeles.

It is believed that these methods provide additional context in understanding data and results, and may serve as a way to present the uncertain results that are inherent to LCA. Methods: Nine building envelope combinations were analyzed according to five service life models (N = 45). Three environmental indicators were used: global warming potential, atmospheric ecotoxicity, and atmospheric acidification from the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts assessment method. Multivariate correlation was performed using nine variables, including cumulative life cycle impact, major replacement, major replacement (frequency), minor replacement, major repairs, minor repairs, inspections 1 and 2, and total transportation (N = 45, 405 data points). The same data set was used for the regression analysis, although the variables were limited to major replacement, minor replacement, major repair, and minor repair (N = 45, 225 data points). SPSS software was used for all statistical calculations. Results and discussion: Multivariate correlation analysis showed strong, statistically significant correlations between cumulative life cycle impact and major replacement across all environmental indicators. Similarly, the regression analysis showed strong R2 values between cumulative life cycle impact and major replacement, such that the influence of all other variables was considerably diminished. Conclusions: The use of inferential statistics provides useful information with respect to the strength and statistical significance of correlations between variables as in multivariate correlation, and allows for predictive capacity of impact, as demonstrated through regression analysis. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the added value of these analytical tools. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Building materials; Construction; Inferential statistics; Life cycle assessment; Uncertainty","acidification; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric acidification; atmospheric ecotoxicity; controlled study; decision making; ecotoxicity; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; Monte Carlo method; multivariate analysis; predictive value; priority journal; regression analysis","","","A.

It depends upon several interactive design factors and climatic diversity. Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) involving operational thermal efficiency with embodied production. Yet upgrading the thermal efficiency of windows and cost of energy savings should be justified from the additional investment cost. Therefore, the study presents a holistic approach for optimizing the windows system integrating operational efficiency with comprehensive LCA and life cycle costing (LCC). The study employed energy simulation software FirstRate5 over a range of energy-efficient windows to assess potential design variables for energy expenditure. Performed simulations illustrate the dominance of façade insulation (R) above glazing in reducing energy consumption, roughly 87% of the cumulative reduction. However, the provision of a zero window is not an optimum solution for permitting daylight and fresh air. Thus, an analytical framework has been proposed for glazing to ensure thermal efficiency, lower embodied impacts, and cost-effectiveness. The resulting Pearson coefficient (r) shows a relatively higher thermal conductivity (Uw = 0.39) correlation with energy consumptions in a colder climate than hot- and warm-temperate environments. Thousands of simulations have been performed to generate data for developing linear regression models. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted to validate the uncertainties of developed models. LCC analysis specifies the provision of glazing 40–68% of the window to wall ratio (WWR) feasible for optimal trade-offs. BIM-enabled LCA (Tally) identifies embodied environmental impacts for Aluminium, Timber, Fiberglass, uPVC, and Composite frame windows following the ISO 14040–14044 standards. Comparative analysis of different framed windows shows the suitability of using uPVC windows over others due to less cost, thermal efficiency, fewer environmental impacts, recycling possessions, and less energy demand at the manufacturing stage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing (LCC); Monte Carlo simulation; Multiple linear regression analyses (MLRA); Optimization; Thermal energy simulation; Window to wall ratio (WWR)","Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Intelligent systems; Investments; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Walls (structural partitions); Energy simulation; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Monte Carlo's simulation; Multiple linear regression analyze; Optimisations; Thermal energy simulation; Window to wall ratio; Window-to-wall ratio; Multiple linear regression","RMIT University, RMIT","The author would like to acknowledge the School of Engineering (Civil & Infrastructure), RMIT University , Melbourne, Australia, for providing the financial support of this research.

Design/methodology/approach: Ten factors affecting LCC in building project cost estimates are identified through literature and interviews. A questionnaire survey is conducted to rank these factors in order of priority and provide the views of cost practitioners about the significance of these factors in the accurate estimation of LCC. The data from 138 construction building projects completed in UK were collected and analysed via multiple regression to discover the relationship between capital and LCCs and between non-cost factors and cost estimation at each stage of the life cycle (capital, operation, maintenance and LCC). Findings: The results of analysis of existing LCC data of completing project and survey data from cost professionals are mostly consistent with many literature views and provide a reasonable description of the non-cost factors affecting the accuracy of estimates. Originality/value: The value of this study is in the method used, which involves analysis of existing life data and survey data from cost professionals. The results provide a plausible description of the non-cost factors affecting the accuracy of estimates. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Building projects; Cost estimation; Life cycle cost; Multiple-regression; Non-cost factors; Questionnaire survey","Cost estimating; Costs; Life cycle; Surveys; Building projects; Cost estimations; Cost factors; Lifecycle costs; Multiple regressions; Questionnaire surveys; Cost benefit analysis","","","A.

Our work has been limited to DDoS attack detection techniques. We propose to extend our framework to general ML system development, based on our review of current ML system development life cycles. We also propose to augment the general life cycle model to include security features to enable building security-in as the development progresses and bolt security-on as flaws are discovered after deployment. Most ML systems today operate in a black-box mode, providing users with only the predictions without associated reasoning as to how the predictions are brought about. There is heavy emphasis now to build mechanisms that help the user develop higher confidence in accepting the predictions of ML systems. Such explainability feature of ML model predictions is a must for critical systems. We also propose to augment our lifecycle model with explainability features. Thus, our ultimate goal is to develop a generic ML lifecycle process augmented with security and explainability features. Such an ML lifecycle process will be of immense use in ML systems development for all domains.  © 2021 IEEE.","Explanation augmented ML life cycle; Machine learning life cycle; MLOpS; Security augmented ML life cycle","Computer aided instruction; Denial-of-service attack; Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Application Lifecycle; Distributed denial of service; Explanation augmented ML life cycle; Life cycle model; Life-cycle process; Machine learning applications; Machine learning life cycle; MLOpS; Security augmented ML life cycle; System development; Life cycle","U.S. Department of Homeland Security, DHS; Air Force Institute of Technology, AFIT","This work was partially supported by a DHS/AFIT grant.

Building on the theoretical rationale of vulnerability life cycle modeling, this assertion is examined with an empirical sample that covers operating system releases from Microsoft and two Linux vendors. Estimation is carried out with a linear regression model. The results indicate that the age of the observed Microsoft products does not affect the turnaround times, and only feeble statistical relationships are present for the examined Linux releases. With this negative result, the paper contributes to the vulnerability life cycle modeling research by presenting and rejecting one theoretically motivated and previously unexplored question. The rejection is also a positive result; there is no reason for users to fear that the turnaround times would significantly lengthen as operating system releases age. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Linux; Microsoft; Negative result; Operating system; Security patching","Information systems; Information use; Linux; Regression analysis; Systems engineering; Turnaround time; Windows operating system; Linear regression models; MicroSoft; Negative result; Operating system; Security patching; Software vulnerabilities; Statistical relationship; Vulnerability life cycle; Life cycle","Tekes","The authors gratefully acknowledge Tekes – the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, DIGILE Oy, and the Cyber Trust research program for their support.

Architectural design decisions play a critical role in a building’s carbon footprint, making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design. © 2024 by the authors.","architectural design; architecture; building information modeling; carbon footprint; large language models; machine learning","Carbon footprint; Computational linguistics; Construction industry; Decision making; Digital devices; Emission control; Information theory; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Artificial intelligence tools; Building Information Modelling; Case-studies; Digital tools; Language model; Large language model; Life-cycle assessment tools; Low carbon; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Architectural design","","","M.

High-quality energy assessment plays a crucial role in developing these strategies. However, accurately assessing energy consumption on a national scale can be challenging due to the complex nature of energy systems and numerous potential influencing factors. This study aims to explore the internal interaction mechanism among energy-related factors from a macro perspective to improve the accuracy of energy consumption assessment. A national-level Integrated Dynamic Energy Assessment (IDEA) model is developed to reveal the potential linear and non-linear relationships in the macro energy system through system dynamics and the least squares method, and meanwhile to quantify the life cycle energy consumption of urban residential buildings in China from 2000 to 2020 accordingly. Results show 1) the five energy-related subsystems (population, economy, building, energy, and environment) achieved significant growth at least twice. 2) there are strong connections among them, as evidenced by multivariate linear and non-linear regression equations; 3) life cycle energy consumption of buildings has increased significantly over the last 20 years from 192.86 M tce to 1131.07 M tee, and the largest contributor is operational energy (45%), followed by embodied energy (33%) and mobile energy (22%) in 2020. 4) The discrepancies in end-uses of the operational energy indicate marked changes in occupants’ energy-use behaviours in recent years. This study provides not only a more precise interactive system for evaluating national-level energy consumption, but also detailed life cycle energy consumption and internal interconnection relationships that can assist China's energy policymaking and serve as a reference for other nations. © 2023 The Author(s)","Building energy consumption; Energy conservation; Energy estimation; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle assessment; Sustainable building","Energy conservation; Historic preservation; Intelligent buildings; Least squares approximations; Life cycle; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Building energy consumption; Energy; Energy assessment; Energy estimation; Energy systems; Energy-consumption; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle energies; Sustainable building; Energy utilization","Australian Government, (DP190100559); Australian Research Council, ARC","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC), Australian Government (No: DP190100559).
