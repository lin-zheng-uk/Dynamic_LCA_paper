Title = {Life Cycle Assessment of building stocks from urban to transnational
   scales: A review},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy consumption
   and environmental impacts worldwide. An assessment of the energy demand
   and environmental performance of building stocks at large spatial scales
   is increasingly needed for decision support in sustainable planning and
   policy making. While current bottom-up building stock models mainly
   focus on the operational energy use, a new research trend has introduced
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a more holistic environmental
   performance assessment including several stages of the building life
   cycle.
   This paper reviews a set of selected bottom-up LCA studies evaluating
   the environmental impact of building stocks at several scales, from
   urban to transnational. The selected studies were analyzed according to
   three common elements: building stock aggregation model, energy analysis
   and LCA. Two main stock aggregation approaches, archetypes and
   building-by-building, are applied to model individual buildings and
   extrapolate results at the stock level. Bottom-up energy models, either
   statistical or engineering-based, provide energy profiles for the
   operational phase of buildings. LCA is subsequently performed to assess
   the building environmental performance and support policy decisions.
   Current limitations and opportunities for the improvement of the LCA of
   large building stocks are finally addressed and discussed to support
   future works. Building stock aggregation models may be enhanced by
   addressing model calibration, integration with Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) and stock dynamics models. Uncertainty propagation,
   sensitivity analysis and model simplification are recommended for energy
   models and LCA to bridge data gaps and reduce computationally intensive
   models. Future research is encouraged on the inclusion of climate
   change, evolution of the energy supply and integrated modeling for the
   LCA of building stocks.},

Abstract = {Demolition waste represents a significant portion of the total generated
   waste and has a high importance from both a waste management and a
   resource efficiency perspective. The urban context is highly relevant to
   assess the environmental impact of the end-of-life stage of buildings
   and potential for future reduction to properly design corresponding
   demolition waste management strategies.
   The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the
   characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the
   potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of
   buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management
   strategies. The methodology combines a bottom-up material stock model
   based on geographical information systems (GIS) and a spatial temporal
   database with life cycle assessment (LCA) for the evaluation of
   end-of-life scenarios.
   The approach was tested for the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg)
   and provided significant results on the quantity and the composition of
   the housing material stock. Two alternative scenarios involving
   recycling rates of respectively 50\% and 70\% for inert materials were
   assessed and an average reduction potential of 25.6\% on abiotic
   depletion potential and 9.2\% on global warming potential was estimated.

Abstract = {This research investigates the relationship between energy use,
   geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in
   Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied
   worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle
   impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed
   and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to
   the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life
   cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy
   consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable
   variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations
   (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The
   variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with
   life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better
   understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of
   building energy consumption in the context of green building rating
   systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems
   approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market
   transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into
   consideration both energy sources and building efficiency.},

Title = {Explorative life-cycle assessment of renovating existing urban
   housingstocks},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban building-stocks are responsible for a significant share of
   resource and energy use. To quantify the potential for reducing energy
   and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly
   used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental
   impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are
   often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often
   used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as
   a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future
   state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of
   the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual
   scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the
   multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses
   an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic
   uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until
   2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on
   either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further
   divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual
   share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings
   of up to 23\% and a corresponding 31\% reduction in greenhouse-gas
   emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand
   are offset by up to 65\% by accounting for material use due to
   construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour
   construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the
   major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point
   indicators used.},

Abstract = {Purpose This research presents a methodology to characterize life cycle
   impact data (LCIA) of alternative construction materials outside of the
   European context.
   Methods This methodology was based on the characterization of data and
   life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS),
   which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose.
   The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by
   different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by
   the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national
   transport at the country level; and local, represented by external
   factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A
   comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The
   functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m(2) core shelter unit
   consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five
   designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material:
   bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and
   soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions' variability and uncertainty
   analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The
   effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed,
   and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed.
   Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three
   levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for
   each country.
   Results and discussion The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block
   and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the
   construction materials' transport distance. Therefore, the level of
   impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a
   high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in
   most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be
   achieved with low environmental impacts.
   Conclusions The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA
   data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of
   consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately
   represent the range of production practices used outside Europe.
   Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment
   of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its
   highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design
   and recognising the structural needs in specific locations.},

   assessment is needed to properly assess the environmental impacts in a
   more holistic way.
   The aim of this study is to develop a geospatial data model for the life
   cycle assessment of environmental impacts of building stocks at the
   urban scale. The methodology includes: geospatial processing of
   building-related data to characterize urban building stocks; a
   spatio-temporal database to store and manage data; life cycle assessment
   to estimate potential environmental impacts.
   The methodology was tested for a case study in Luxembourg and
   preliminary results regarding the retrofitting stage of residential
   buildings were provided for one entire city. The data model is part of a
   wider bottom-up framework being developed to support decision about
   building stock retrofitting for sustainable urban planning.},

Title = {A GIS based method to calculate regionalized land use characterization
   factors for life cycle impact assessment using LANCA®},

Abstract = {Purpose Land is used and modified in its natural function for the
   cultivation of food and energy crops, for infrastructure and other
   production purposes. Despite their global significance, land use impacts
   are still rarely addressed, although methods for integrating land use
   into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This
   paper describes the development and calculation of regionalized
   characterization factors based on the LANCA (R) (Land Use Indicator
   Value Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment) method to be integrated into
   LCA using a geo information system (GIS). Methods With the publication
   of the LANCA (R) characterization factors (Bos et al. 2016), land use
   impacts can be assessed at the country level. However, soil parameters
   as well as climatic conditions change on a small scale and are very
   site-specific. Therefore, there is a need for regionalized
   characterization factors. After a literature review, we describe the
   development of the five LANCA (R) indicators. Afterwards we present the
   conceptual framework for the calculation of GIS-based characterization
   factors and apply this framework to two examples, the indicators of
   mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration. Finally, we apply
   the characterization factors in a case study. Results, application and
   discussion The region-specific characterization factors are calculated
   in a GIS environment yielding a map with values for mechanical
   filtration and physicochemical filtration per grid cell for various land
   use types. A case study shows that land use impacts fluctuate due to
   site-specific conditions such as pedological, topographical and climatic
   conditions. It can be shown that our calculation of regionalized
   characterization factors in global maps is feasible and facilitates an
   area's potential for causing lower environmental impacts for a certain
   land use compared to other areas. Remaining challenges are related to
   input data quality, the comprehensibility of the results to
   practitioners that are not land use experts and the technical
   restrictions of LCA database and software providers. Conclusions Through
   the presented regionalization of the LANCA (R) framework, a necessary
   prerequisite to method advancement is met as also region-specific
   characterization factors can now be calculated. In comparison to the
   published country-specific characterization factors in Bos et al.
   (2016), the developed regional GIS-based characterization factors are
   far more advantageous especially for large countries. Nevertheless, it
   has to be noted that an LCA including the evaluation of land use does
   not replace methods and tools like environmental impact assessment. When
   deciding on a preferable location for a specific land use nature
   conservation, geographical, geological and building law aspects must
   also be taken into account.},

   Lifecycle: A Move toward nD Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) to support
   various tasks of building lifecycle management (BLM) has been reported
   in a range of studies. However, during its lifetime, a building is an
   important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must
   not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its
   participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what
   way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its
   surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been
   reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building
   lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a
   building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however
   potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet
   been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of
   application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM
   processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings,
   site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby
   facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical
   framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM
   and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all
   stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable
   decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management
   of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established
   that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated
   solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective. (c) 2021 American

Title = {A spatiotemporally differentiated product system modelling framework for
   consequential life cycle assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {333},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) applied to systems under
   continuous evolution, such as cities, usually disregard interactions
   among local components, how policy decisions influence them, and the
   value of spatial data. As a result, local environmental impacts might
   not be well-considered. This paper investigates how a spatially explicit
   system dynamics (SD) modelling approach can overcome such limitation,
   contributing to the advancement of CLCA. First, a novel CLCA conceptual
   framework is presented combining consequential life cycle inventories,
   SD principles and the use of spatially explicit data. Second, its
   innovative value is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept SD-CLCA
   model. This model evaluates the environmental impacts of changes in
   electricity supply-demand in the market due to an increasing adoption of
   solar photovoltaic panels (SPV) in residential buildings. It allows
   traceability of both system changes and their environmental
   consequences. For demonstration purposes, the SD-CLCA model is applied
   to Lisbon municipality and the broader electricity market of Portugal.
   Results showcase how SD-CLCA models could provide a closer
   representation of the real effects of predicted changes in the
   electricity market due to different SPV adoption scenarios. They also
   illustrate that changes in gross domestic product, population and
   precipitation provide a diversified set of impact scores. As a
   methodological advancement, and to the net of a few shortcomings, the
   proposed SD-CLCA model is able to capture the complexity of cause-effect
   dynamics determining environmental impacts, which currently represents a
   research gap in LCA.},

Title = {Life cycle inventory regionalization and uncertainty characterization: A
   multilevel modeling approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Life cycle inventory (LCI) databases are essential to evaluate the
   environmental burden of a product or service using life cycle assessment
   (LCA). The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results
   has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and
   quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is
   proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and
   uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to
   retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between
   the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and
   material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather
   than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The
   uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction
   interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer
   application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states
   from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed
   approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods.
   For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively,
   around 60\% and 80\% of variations within the datasets are explained by
   MLM, and 86.1\% and 96.8\% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the
   MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3\% and 70.5\% when
   traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95\% prediction
   intervals cover more than 95\% of measurement data in both input cases.
   It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for
   future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical
   information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. (c) 2019

Title = {Innovating the Construction Life Cycle through BIM/GIS Integration: A
   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the
   digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building
   information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall
   life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration
   with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical
   analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share
   several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to
   address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management,
   where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a
   systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to
   retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results
   found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and
   suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and
   practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address
   ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the
   BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA
   approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration
   topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for
   BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is
   the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to
   perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems
   for asset management.},

Title = {BIM- and GIS-Based Life-Cycle-Assessment Framework for Enhancing Eco
   Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable
   materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of
   carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural
   resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major
   contributor towards climate change and given that the construction
   industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial
   to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the
   context of developing countries. This research presents a novel
   framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information
   modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information
   systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize
   construction's design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and
   waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in
   Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and
   a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have
   been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of
   available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied
   emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to
   disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses.
   Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an
   optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization
   tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The
   case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the
   results show that 29.35\% of the materialization stage, 16.04\% of the
   operational stage, and 21.14\% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions
   can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental
   degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle
   might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective
   environmental impacts.},

Title = {Use of GIS and BIM tools in determining the life cycle impact of urban
   systems. Case study: Residential buildings which apply the
   Eco-Efficiency Matrix in the city of Quito, Ecuador},

Abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on
   changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction,
   which generates approximately 33\% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere
   and con-tributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present,
   interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of
   various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact.
   Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently
   linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75\% of carbon
   emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban
   concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically
   visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement
   routes were located according to the types of transport used and the
   location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as
   points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several
   tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level.
   The impact of the building in the production, construction,
   de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use
   of the three tools -LCA, BIM and GIS -allowed us to establish that the
   highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high
   consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in
   Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental
   impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore
   essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix,
   which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.},

Title = {Multi-information integration-based life cycle analysis of greenhouse
   gas emissions for prefabricated construction: A case study of Shenzhen},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global
   construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time,
   improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It
   is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
   with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However,
   there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced
   technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in
   prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi
   -information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG
   emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the
   production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The
   results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for
   the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77
   kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively,
   with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated
   components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest
   share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11\%, while the transportation
   and construction phases contribute 3.30\% and 0.59\% of the total
   emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of pre-fabricated
   construction can lead to a 31.62\% reduction in total GHG emissions per
   square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to
   traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study
   contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for
   calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of
   GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings.
   These findings can serve as practical references for future research to
   achieve the construction industry's green and low -carbon goals.},

Title = {Multi-sourced data modelling of spatially heterogenous life-cycle carbon
   mitigation from installed rooftop photovoltaics: A case study in
   Singapore},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {362},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Accurately quantifying carbon mitigation of operational photovoltaics
   (PVs) influenced by dynamic geoenvironment is crucial for developing
   suitable initiatives on renewable energy transition. However, previous
   studies made strong assumptions to avoid modelling spatial heterogeneity
   of carbon footprints or ignore weather and shadowing effects on PV
   electricity generation, making the estimated results unreliable and even
   causing false policymaking. To tackle this challenge, we developed a
   novel model coupling multi -sourced data modelling and life -cycle
   assessment to estimate spatially heterogenous carbon mitigation of all
   the operational rooftop PVs in an entire city. It is built by three
   hierarchal modules: (i) segmenting PV areas from high -resolution
   satellite imagery, by using Deep Solar PV Refiner, an advanced semantic
   segmentation network; (ii) estimating electricity generation in the
   segmented PV areas, by using a well -developed 3D solar irradiation
   model that considers the effects of land surface solar irradiation
   influenced by weather and shadowing effects produced by 3D buildings;
   (iii) quantifying carbon mitigation potential of PVs, by developing a
   spatial -aware life -cycle model to track the life -cycle carbon
   footprints of PVs from production, transportation, operation, to
   decommission. Investigating Singapore by 2020, we reveal that
   industrial, airport, and residential areas have the largest rooftop PV
   installation. We also suggest a carbon emission rate of 13.20 g-CO 2
   /kWh, a carbon payback time of 0.81 years, and an energy payback time of
   0.94 years, showing an improved carbon mitigation capability compared to
   the past years. This study contributes to GIS data modelling and helps
   understand the geospatial characteristics of urbanscale PV carbon
   mitigation.},

   GIS-Based Comparative Methodology for Evaluating Energy Efficiency
   Solutions},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The Italian residential building stock consists of 12.2 million
   buildings, with 7.2 constructed post-World War II during the economic
   boom. These structures were designed without specific regulations for
   seismic safety, fire resistance, and energy efficiency, and today lies
   the current state of strong obsolescence. Therefore, energy
   refurbishment may not always be the best cost/benefit solution due to
   these intrinsic issues. Consequently, the transition to construction
   systems based on circular economy principles brings new opportunities
   and becomes key to proposing replacement interventions for this
   heritage. This paper presents a comparative GIS-based bottom-up approach
   to evaluate the lifecycle impact of residential building blocks,
   encompassing energy, environmental, and economic aspects. Two tools are
   introduced: one for measuring energy consumption and the other for
   quantifying the quantities of materials stored in buildings. This
   methodology permits comparing the new circular buildings and different
   refurbishment scenarios to identify the most suitable solution from an
   environmental impact and financial point of view. The application of a
   case study, a residential urban block in Bologna, built in 1945-1965,
   highlights how the demolition and reconstruction scenario based on
   circular economy principles presents the lowest environmental impacts
   and is economically competitive compared to standard deep renovation
   techniques.},

Abstract = {Quemoy University has taken over Cemetery 2 region after it was released
   by the military. It became the school's other campus, with plans to
   change the site from an unused military camp to a sustainable campus.
   The finished project will include a carbon inventory of the buildings
   and landscape of the original camp, and overall campus planning and
   design. Incorporating the concept of applying GIS, the planning and
   survey data mentioned above will be used as the basis for the future
   research design and implementation. Aerial maps will be combined with
   cadastral and topographic maps to establish a basic evaluation resource
   map: a site plan map, data point map, building carbon footprint map, and
   route carbon footprint map. The main carbon hotspot of each building's
   life cycle total carbon footprint is 549,293.14 kgCO(2)e/30 yr. Through
   putting solar panel systems on the buildings' rooftops and the 30 year
   landscape carbon inventory principle of no disturbance as the carbon
   offset, the unused military campus will become a zero-carbon campus. The
   maps above will act as carbon diagnostics for future campus operation
   carbon footprint analysis and provide the current situation of the
   campus's environmental sustainability and future visual scenario

Abstract = {As the key for building the new power system and achieving the
   ``dual-carbon{''} goal, the development of electric vehicle industry is
   closely connected with the supporting and improvement of charging and
   swapping infrastructure. However, the difficult cost recovery and
   unbalanced regional development appeared due to the low utilization as
   well as nonstandard siting and sizing of charging and swapping
   infrastructure. In order to guide the investment and construction of
   charging and swapping infrastructure correctly and effectively, it is
   essential to conduct in-depth research with respect to siting and sizing
   of charging and swapping infrastructure at this stage. On the basis of
   Particle Swarm Optimization, this paper builds an optimization model of
   siting and sizing for the fast charging stations through dividing
   regions in accordance with the charging demand of electric taxi, the
   geographical information of inapplicable location and other factors. The
   case result indicates that the model proposed herein is capable of
   improving economic benefits of investment operators and guiding the
   investment and construction of AC charging piles by means of maximizing
   the net income of the charging station throughout full life cycle, and
   determining the geographic location of charging stations and the
   quantities of charging piles to be configured. After optimizing the
   location of charging stations, it can maximize life-cycle net incomes of
   675.86 million yuan and determine the optimized amounts of charging
   piles in each charing station are 159, 339 and 563, respectively.},

Title = {Coupling geospatial suitability simulation and life cycle carbon
   emissions towards uncertain optimization planning for
   wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {321},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Building clean and modern multi-energy complementary systems is a direct
   path to decarbonization in energy sector. The introduction of hydrogen
   energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy
   complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key
   issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen
   multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to
   finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system,
   consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process,
   and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the
   planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the
   following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation
   based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on
   probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration
   optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes
   the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective.
   The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization
   from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the
   system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon
   emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained
   only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional
   distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in
   this study decreased by 82.75 \%. In addition, considering that the
   system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can
   reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 \% but only increase costs by
   about 29.4 \%. The computational results justify the proposed
   optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the
   system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference
   for practice.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40\% of the final energy use and one third
   of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. At the city scale, a quantitative
   assessment of the environmental impact of buildings is essential to
   support sustainable energy policies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has
   been widely used to assess building related environmental impacts;
   however, its extension to the urban scale is still hampered by several
   operational challenges. Coupling LCA and Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS) has been identified as a promising solution but developments are
   still needed.
   This paper presents an automated approach for the energy modelling and
   LCA of urban housing stocks based on GIS. The main steps of the approach
   are the following: (i) GIS-based building stock characterization; (ii)
   automated building-by-building energy analysis; (iii) Environmental
   impact calculation via LCA. The approach was applied to the test case
   city Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourg) to assess the potential environmental
   impact reduction driven by housing retrofitting.
   Results were provided building-by-building and displayed as maps for
   improved communication. An energy savings potential of 35.3\% and a
   Global Warming Potential (GWP) reduction of 30.8\% were calculated as
   results of retrofitting. The average contribution of the retrofitting
   stage on the residual life of the building stock is 4 to 10\% of the
   GWP, depending on the building type.
   The study provided one of the first models able to perform a
   fully-fledged LCA of buildings at the urban scale in a bottom-up
   fashion. The results are meant to support local authorities in setting
   priority strategies for environmental impact reduction.},
