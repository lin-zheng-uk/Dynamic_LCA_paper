Title = {State-of-the-art on research and applications of machine learning in the
   building life cycle},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Fueled by big data, powerful and affordable computing resources, and
   advanced algorithms, machine learning has been explored and applied to
   buildings research for the past decades and has demonstrated its
   potential to enhance building performance. This study systematically
   surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of
   building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of
   Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153
   papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is
   increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and
   control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building
   commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and
   diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy
   baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and
   learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the
   existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to
   common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to
   train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which
   limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another
   building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs
   and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance
   might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method
   might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others.
   Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to
   improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and
   resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the
   field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building
   science, computing science, data science, and social science. (C) 2020

Abstract = {In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are
   introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control
   towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect
   complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process
   optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle
   management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the
   real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of
   Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with
   proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building
   asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability,
   interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM
   to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were
   performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability,
   interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides
   decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation
   of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of

Title = {Comparison of regression models for estimation of carbon emissions
   during building's lifecycle using designing factors: a case study of
   residential buildings in Tianjin, China},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {204},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Many studies have been conducted on life cycle assessment and control
   measures for carbon emissions of buildings. Methods proposed by these
   studies usually require not only specific accounting model, but also
   detailed inventory data, which is not available at early design stage.
   Seeing that the importance of design phase to carbon emissions during
   building's lifecycle, a study on regression model of carbon emissions
   using designing factors was done. Firstly, based on process analysis
   method, the carbon emissions of 207 residential buildings in Tianjin
   were calculated. The results show that annual carbon emissions per floor
   area are between 30 and 60 kgCO(2)/(m(2).year), with manufacture phase
   and operation phase accounting for 11\%-25\% and 75\%-87\%,
   respectively. Then, correlation analysis and elastic net were used to
   determine 12 designing factors for predictive model; At last, four
   regression techniques, PCR, RF, MLP and SVR were used to develop
   regression models, respectively; comparison and process analysis of
   model development were given later. The results show that SVR has the
   optimal predictive accuracy among four models, its corresponding
   coefficient of determination can reach to 0.800. This regression model
   can be utilized to estimate carbon emissions based on designing factors,
   which can help designers make a strategic decision at early stage. (C)

Title = {The application of life cycle assessment in buildings: challenges, and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research
   trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research.
   Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current
   research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review
   methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research
   publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and
   retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA
   applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research.
   Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified,
   which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and
   discussions This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively
   control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such
   mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new
   generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and
   continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective
   operation and management strategies of buildings and districts.
   Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system
   modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant
   emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently
   missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life
   cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent
   characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA
   results. Conclusions and recommendations This paper promotes the concept
   of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and
   spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and
   thus more effectively promotes a ``cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation{''}
   environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to
   leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic
   models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable
   environmental assessments.},

Abstract = {Purpose Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the process of systematically
   assessing impacts when there is an interaction between the environment
   and human activity. Machine learning (ML) with LCA methods can help
   contribute greatly to reducing impacts. The sheer number of input
   parameters and their uncertainties that contribute to the full life
   cycle make a broader application of ML complex and difficult to achieve.
   Hence a systems engineering approach should be taken to apply ML in
   isolation to aspects of the LCA. This study addresses the challenge of
   leveraging ML methods to deliver LCA solutions. The overarching
   hypothesis is that: LCA underpinned by ML methods and informed by
   dynamic data paves the way to more accurate LCA while supporting life
   cycle decision making. Methods In this study, previous research on ML
   for LCA were considered, and a literature review was undertaken. Results
   The results showed that ML can be a useful tool in certain aspects of
   the LCA. ML methods were shown to be applied efficiently in optimization
   scenarios in LCA. Finally, ML methods were integrated as part of
   existing inventory databases to streamline the LCA across many use
   cases. Conclusions The conclusions of this article summarise the
   characteristics of existing literature and provide suggestions for
   future work in limitations and gaps which were found in the literature.},

Title = {Building life-span prediction for life cycle assessment and life cycle
   cost using machine learning: A big data approach},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) are two primary
   methods used to assess the environmental and economic feasibility of
   building construction. An estimation of the building's life span is
   essential to carrying out these methods. However, given the diverse
   factors that affect the building's life span, it was estimated typically
   based on its main structural type. However, different buildings have
   different life spans. Simply assuming that all buildings with the same
   structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious
   estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records
   describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the
   actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span
   prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning.
   The prediction models examined in this study produced root mean square
   errors of 3.72-4.6 and the coefficients of determination of 0.932-0.955.
   Among those models, a deep-learning based prediction model was found the
   most powerful. As anticipated, the conventional method of determining a
   building's life expectancy using a discrete set of specific factors and
   associated assumptions of life span did not yield realistic results.
   This study demonstrates that an application of deep learning to the LCA
   and LCC of a building is a promising direction, effectively guiding
   business planning and critical decision making throughout the
   construction process.},

Abstract = {This research proposed an integrated strategy for building performance
   optimization from the whole life cycle perspective to explore the
   optimal building scheme. After the feature elimination, the ensemble
   learning model (ELM) was trained to obtain a high-precision model for

   and indoor discomfort hours (IDH). Then, the optimal optimization
   algorithm was selected among three different optimization algorithms.
   Finally, the best building scheme was chosen according to the newly
   proposed solution. The results showed that the ELM could achieve high
   prediction efficiency by combining input feature evaluation and
   screening, multi-sampling methods, and hyperparameter optimization. The
   R2 value of ELM can reach 0.980, while the Two-Archive Evolutionary
   Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimi-zation (C-TAEA) was the
   optimal optimization algorithm. The best equilibrium solution proposed
   in this study solved the problem of different optimization ranges of
   different objectives and maximized the optimization value. Finally, the
   best equilibrium scheme reduced the LCCE by 34.7\%, the LCC by 13.9\%,
   and the IDH by 26.6\%. Therefore, this strategy can efficiently optimize
   building objectives and produce a more balanced and optimal building
   scheme, thus making it widely applicable in building performance
   optimization.},

Title = {Applications of artificial intelligence for energy efficiency throughout
   the building lifecycle: An overview},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {305},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in buildings can
   assist in reducing energy consumption through enhanced control,
   automation, and reliability. This review aims to explore the use of AI
   to enhance energy efficiency throughout various stages of the building
   lifecycle, including building design, construction, operation and
   control, maintenance, and retrofit. The review encompasses multiple
   studies in the field published between 2018 and 2023. These studies were
   identified through keyword searches that best represent the topic, using
   various research databases. In addition to summarizing the technologies
   and approaches related to AI and energy efficiency, this review
   discusses future opportunities for the application of AI in energy
   efficiency within these lifecycle stages. The review highlights that
   AI-based solutions are currently employed in building design generation
   and optimization, decision-making, predictive and adaptive control,
   fault detection and diagnosis, as well as energy benchmarking. These
   applications effectively facilitate energy efficiency in buildings to
   meet today's energy needs. However, further research is needed to
   explore the use of AI in the construction phase to support the
   development of energy-efficient construction techniques and systems, in
   addition to scheduling and predictive decision-making.},

Title = {Machine learning for performance prediction in smart buildings:
   Photovoltaic self-consumption and life cycle cost optimization},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {334},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The application of Photovoltaic (PV) system in buildings is growing
   rapidly in response to the need for clean energy sources and building
   decarbonization targets. Nonetheless, enhancing PV self-consumption
   through technical solutions such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is
   getting higher importance to increase the profitability of PV plants, by
   minimizing the building-grid interaction. In this context, analyzing PV
   self-consumption of different energy storage configurations becomes more
   relevant and crucial in building energy modeling although it is heavily
   time-consuming and complicated, particularly within a multi-objective
   optimization related to the ESS design. As a solution to resolve this
   issue, this paper evaluates the accuracy, training, and prediction speed
   of 24 Machine Learning (ML) models to be used as surrogate models for
   analyzing PV self-consumption in smart buildings. Furthermore, the
   performance of short-term Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to increase PV
   self -consumption is assessed and presented using ML models. The results
   showed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Networks (NN)
   including bilayered and trilayered NN models, Support Vector Machines
   (SVM) including the fine gaussian and cubic SVM models, and Ensembles of
   Trees (EoT) as superior ML models. The results also revealed that TES
   systems can efficiently increase PV self-consumption in the building
   equipped with electric heat pumps to provide heating, cooling, and
   domestic hot water. Moreover, the TES size optimization regarding the
   Life Cycle Cost (LCC) showed that the LCC-based optimum TES size can
   yield 7.1\% savings within 30 years of the building service life. The
   novelties of this research are first to provide a reference to select
   the most suitable ML models in predicting PV self-consumption, second to
   implement machine learning for analyzing the performance of short-term
   thermal energy storage to enhance PV self-consumption in buildings, and
   third to carry out an LCC-based optimization on TES size using ML-based
   prediction models.},

Abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been used for predicting
   facility-related costs but there is a lack of research on developing
   machine learning models for the complete life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis
   of facilities. This research aims to systematically investigate the
   feasibility of forecasting facilities' LCC by implementing machine
   learning on historical data. The authors propose a comprehensive and
   generalizable framework for developing facility LCC analysis machine
   learning models. This framework specifies the data requirements,
   methods, and expected results in each step of the model development
   process. First, a literature review and a questionnaire survey were
   conducted to determine the independent variables affecting facility LCC
   and to identify the potential data sources. The process of using raw
   data to derive LCC components is then discussed. Finally, a
   proof-of-concept case study was conducted on a university campus to
   demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. This research
   concludes that current building systems already contain the data for LCC
   analysis and that the proposed framework is effective in facility LCC

   cycle energy assessment: A review},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {160},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Over the last few decades, the construction sector's energy consumption
   has increased tremendously. Buildings consume both embodied energy (EE)
   and operational energy (OE) during their life cycle. EE is consumed by
   processes associated with construction, whereas OE is spent operating
   the building. Studies show that improving the operational efficiency of
   a building may have serious implications for EE. Building life cycle
   energy assessments (LCEA) is, therefore, essential to understanding the
   dichotomy between EE and OE. In recent years, increased availability and
   accessibility of large-scale data have made data-driven approaches a
   popular choice for building performance assessments. In this context,
   numerous review articles have highlighted and tracked current trends in
   building load prediction methods. While this work is significant, there
   remains a lack of reviews focusing on data-driven approaches from a
   building life cycle energy perspective. In this paper, we conduct a
   systematic review of literature to identify key factors hindering the
   application of machine learning techniques specifically for building
   LCEA. They include: (i) issues of data collection, quality, and
   availability; (ii) lack of standardized methodologies; and (iii)
   temporal representativeness and granularity of prediction. Finally, we
   discuss potential solutions, future directions, and research
   opportunities for data-driven LCEA research.},

   life-cycle cost-based optimal design of self-centering building
   structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Self-centering systems have emerged as innovative lateral
   force-resisting mechanisms aimed at improving the earthquake resilience
   of building structures. The fully self-centering behavior effectively
   eliminates the residual deformation, thereby improving the
   post-earthquake repairability of building structures. However, this
   behavior does intensify floor acceleration responses that contribute to
   nonstructural damage and lead to increased initial costs. This research
   aims to develop a general machine learning and genetic algorithm-based
   framework for optimizing the design of self-centering building
   structures and to strike a balance between the initial costs and seismic
   losses by minimizing the overall life-cycle cost. The artificial neural
   network (ANN) based StructureNet model was developed for accelerating
   the calculation of life-cycle costs associated with self-centering
   structures. The genetic algorithm was adopted to determine the optimal
   design parameters for self-centering structures. The framework was
   applied to 8 design cases, with the analysis centering on two factors:
   the maximum allowable residual inter-story drift for controlling
   demolition and the initial construction cost of self-centering members.
   The study examined their influences on the optimization design results
   of self-centering building structures. The findings highlight a
   preference for a design approach that leans toward partially
   self-centering behavior as opposed to fully self-centering behavior,
   indicating the higher life-cycle benefits of partially selfcentering
   behavior.},

Title = {A probabilistic life-cycle assessment of carbon emission from magnesium
   phosphate cementitious material with uncertainty analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {427},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {This study aims to quantify the carbon emission intensity of magnesium
   phosphate cementitious materials to explore its potential in carbon
   emission reduction. However, comprehensive research on the lifecycle
   carbon emissions of these materials remains scarce, plagued by issues of
   data uncertainty, accessibility, and scoping discrepancies. Therefore, a
   probabilistic lifecycle assessment approach was adopted in this study,
   enabling un-certainty analysis of the carbon emission intensity of
   magnesium phosphate cementitious materials. The findings indicate that
   the 10.5th percentile of the carbon emission intensity simulations for
   MPC stands at 0.624 kgCO2e/ kg, suggesting that nearly 90\% of the
   values surpass those of OPC, thereby refuting the presumption of its
   low-carbon attributes. Notably, the consumption and carbon emission
   factors of magnesium oxide and soluble phosphates emerge as pivotal
   influences on its carbon emissions. Additionally, a multiple linear
   regression model was employed to forecast the correlation between the
   constituents of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials and the
   volume of carbon emissions. Through this study, we can have a more
   comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of
   magnesium phosphate cementitious materials in terms of carbon emission
   reduction, which will provide an important support for the selection and
   design of future green building materials.},

   of the global energy supply per year, suggesting that significant
   efforts may be needed to reduce building energy demand and its carbon
   footprint. During their lifespans, buildings consume embodied energy
   (EE) and operational energy (OE). Building professionals, therefore,
   conduct life cycle energy assessments (LCEA) to quantify and understand
   the paradox and interconnectedness between EE and OE. Traditionally,
   simulation-based optimization techniques were used for design space
   exploration to identify a building design with the fewest energy
   implications. However, literature shows these data-driven approaches are
   often error-prone, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, and
   they fail to provide real-time feedback to the user. Moreover, EE and OE
   assessment tools are disjointed and suffer from interoperability issues.
   These limitations restrict design space exploration, which eventually
   hinders the design decision-making process. Over the last few years, the
   increased availability of building data has made machine learning (ML)
   techniques a popular choice for building performance assessments.
   Several articles have developed prediction models to assess or optimize
   OE. While this work is significant, studies utilizing ML techniques for
   building LCEA are lacking, mainly due to the unavailability of a
   large-scale LCEA database. In this paper, we propose a methodology to
   (1) generate a simulation-based building energy dataset for different
   building typologies using a parametric framework, (2) utilize the
   synthetically generated database to develop an ML-based prediction model
   to predict EE and OE, and (3) test the model using a case study. The
   case study results show that the model achieves high prediction
   performance using minimal inputs available during the early design
   phase. The results further indicate that ML techniques can be used by
   building designers with no or limited LCE expertise to instantaneously
   estimate building LCE performance and help them select design options
   with minimal LCE consumption.},

Title = {Enhancing the Practicality of Tools to Estimate the Whole Life Embodied
   Carbon of Building Structures <i>via</i> Machine Learning Models},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The construction and operation of buildings account for significant
   environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy
   demand, resource consumption and waste generation. While the operation
   of buildings is fairly well regulated and globally considered in the
   pathways to net-zero mid-century targets, a different picture emerges
   when looking at the other life cycle stages, which incur the so-called
   embodied impacts. These cover raw material extraction and product
   manufacturing through to construction and end of life activities. Only a
   handful of examples exist where such embodied carbon (EC) emissions are
   enshrined in law with most of the ongoing debate still around estimating
   and understanding where such emissions occur and how to mitigate them.
   Building structures account for a significant share of a building's
   embodied emissions and they also are the building element with the
   longest service life, thus presenting potential lock-in challenges for
   choices made today. To support the ongoing global effort to mitigate
   embodied carbon and equip engineers and designers worldwide with
   easy-to-use and robust calculation tools, we describe a real-time
   decision-support tool to aid building design that leverages machine
   learning (ML) methods from computer science to speed-up the
   computationally expensive process of finite element analysis (FEA)
   traditionally exploited in structural engineering. We demonstrate that
   replacing FEA calculations with a model learnt using ML from a large
   dataset offers real time decision support while guaranteeing the same
   level of confidence and accuracy that a traditional FEA-based method
   would offer at the design stage. The tool has been developed both as a
   standalone version and as a plugin for Trimble SketchUp to maximise its
   usability and diffusion. It offers results correlated with uncertainty
   analysis in the form of probability density functions to account for the
   inherent variability of input data that characterises early stages in
   the design process. This research contributes to the ongoing global
   efforts to decarbonising the built environment and offers an immediately
   implementable method and tool for doing so.</p>},

Title = {Improving building resilience in the face of future climate uncertainty:
   A comprehensive framework for enhancing building life cycle performance},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {302},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This research introduces an innovative resilient design framework,
   addressing gaps in building performance optimization by considering a
   holistic life cycle perspective and factoring in climate projection
   uncertainties from the 2020s to 2090s. The study concludes that in the
   case study, future climate scenarios in different Shared Socio-Economic
   Paths significantly impact building life cycle performance, with wall
   U-value, windows U-value, and wall density identified as major factors
   affecting building performance under future climate uncertainty. The
   ensemble learning model achieves high fidelity in predicting life cycle
   carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle cost (LCC), and indoor discomfort
   hours (IDH) through input feature screening and hyperparameter
   optimization. Comparing optimization algorithms, Two-Archive
   Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimization
   (C-TAEA) demonstrates better convergence degree and optimization effect.
   Among the tested multi-criteria decision making methods, the VIKOR
   method selects the best building resilient design scheme from the Pareto
   data set, effectively reducing LCCE, LCC, and IDH, and leading to an
   overall improvement in building life cycle performance. Applying this
   framework, the finalized scheme for an office building in cold region
   optimizes 44.0\% of LCCE, 8.2\% of LCC, and 4.3\% of IDH. This framework
   develops a new approach to improve building life cycle performance under
   future climate uncertainty and supports informed decision-making for
   resilient building design. To promote carbon neutrality in construction,
   it is urged that future studies incorporate additional sources of
   uncertainty, such as occupant behavior, into the proposed framework.},

Title = {A data-driven framework for designing a renewable energy community based
   on the integration of machine learning model with life cycle assessment
   and life cycle cost parameters},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {358},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {This research paper presents a data-driven framework for design
   optimization of renewable energy communities (RECs) in the residential
   sector, considering both techno-economic challenges and environmental
   impact. The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for
   photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy
   systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To
   achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro
   and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that
   integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life
   cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a
   multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC
   and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a
   multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model
   (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection
   criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario
   optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the
   effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of
   REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for
   the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona,
   Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial
   improvement in economic , environmental benefits for designing REC, the
   optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE =
   0.044 \$/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction
   of 85.04\% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE =
   0.220 \$/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in
   environmental impact of 54.59\% compared to the base case. Overall, the
   developed data -driven provides policy decision -making with an
   evaluation of REC in the residential sector.},

Title = {Implementation of a Life Cycle Cost Deep Learning Prediction Model Based
   on Building Structure Alternatives for Industrial Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Undoubtedly, most industrial buildings have a huge Life Cycle Cost (LCC)
   throughout their lifespan, and most of these costs occur in structural
   operation and maintenance costs, environmental impact costs, etc. Hence,
   it is necessary to think about a fast way to determine the LCC values.
   Therefore, this article presents an LCC deep learning prediction model
   to assess structural and envelope-type alternatives for industrial
   building, and to make a decision for the most suitable structure. The
   input and output criteria of the prediction model were collected from
   previous studies. The deep learning network model was developed using a
   Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) hidden
   layers. Seven investigation cases were studied to validate the
   prediction model of a 312-item dataset over a period of 30 years, after
   the training phase of the network to take the suitable hidden layers of
   the RBM and hidden neurons in each hidden layer that achieved the
   minimal errors of the model. Another case was studied in the model to
   compare design structure alternatives, consisting of three main
   structure frames-a reinforced concrete frame, a precast/pre-stressed
   concrete frame, and a steel frame-over their life cycle, and make a
   decision. Precast/pre-stressed concrete frames were the best decision
   until the end of the life cycle cost, as it is possible to reuse the
   removed sections in a new industrial building.},

Abstract = {In the construction industry, estimating the realistic lifespan of
   buildings is essential to properly perform life cycle assessments
   (LCAs). It is impractical to consider all of the different factors
   affecting building lifespan; therefore, most LCAs assume a standard
   building lifespan for each major type of building structure. However,
   the lifespans of buildings vary significantly in practice, and applying
   a uniform lifespan to all buildings with the same structural type may
   lead to completely erroneous LCA results. In this study, LCAs of
   waterproofing methods on building models and actual buildings in Korea
   are used to empirically demonstrate the effect of realistic lifespan
   prediction using big data. Applying a more representative building
   lifespan of 5-39 years in the waterproofing LCAs of an architectural
   model decreased the carbon emissions in all phases (construction,
   operation and maintenance, and demolition) by 78-24\%, respectively,
   relative to a 50 year lifespan assumption. During the maintenance phase,
   the reductions were 100-31\%, respectively. The accuracy of the
   waterproofing LCAs of 17 real buildings became more irregular as the
   percentage error of the predicted lifespan increased, although the LCA
   analysis results had 0\% error for buildings with a predicted lifespan
   error of 6\% or less. Therefore, depending on the research purpose, a
   low-error predictive building lifespan model can evidently support
   accurate LCA results. This study proves that the use of a big data-based
   building lifespan prediction method is essential for LCA and is an
   effective tool for business planning and critical decision making
   throughout the construction process.},

Title = {Predicting whole-life carbon emissions for buildings using different
   machine learning algorithms: A case study on typical residential
   properties in Cornwall, UK},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {357},

Abstract = {Whole-life carbon emissions (WLCE) studies are critical in assessing the
   environmental impact of buildings and promoting sustainable design
   practices. However, existing methods for estimating WLCE are
   time-consuming and data-intensive, limiting their usefulness in the
   early building design stages. In response to this, this research
   introduces a novel approach by harnessing various machine learning
   algorithms to predict WLCE and WLCE intensity (normalised by floor area)
   for buildings. To evaluate the suitability of machine learning
   algorithms, we conducted an experiment involving ten algorithms to build
   the prediction models. These models were trained using data from 150
   typical residential properties in Cornwall, UK, along with 28 features
   obtained from a comprehensive survey, including floor area, heating
   type, and occupant characteristics. The ten algorithms include Multiple
   Linear Regression, and non-linear algorithms such as Decision Tree,
   Random Forest. Performance evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of
   determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), means squared error
   (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and elapsed time, were employed.
   Our research contributes to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of
   machine learning models in predicting building WLCE. We reveal that all
   the tested machine learning algorithms have the capability to predict
   WLCE and WLCE intensity, non-linear models outperform linear ones, and
   the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrates superior performance in terms
   of accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This research encourages the
   integration of life cycle studies into the early design stage, even
   within tight building design schedules, offering practical guidance to
   architects and designers. Furthermore, these results also benefit a wide
   range of stakeholders, not only the architects but also the engineers,
   policymakers, and life cycle assessment (LCA) researchers, contributing
   to the advancement of data-driven sustainability approaches within the
   building sector.},

Title = {Toward automated life cycle assessment for additive manufacturing: A
   systematic review of influential parameters and framework design},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {253-274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), a disruptive technology of building parts
   layer-by-layer directly from 3D models, has been considered a tempting
   cleaner production process compared to other conventional production
   routes. This is because AM has demonstrated impressive green
   characteristics which contributed to significantly reduced material and
   energy consumptions, a shorter supply chain, and diversion of the waste
   stream by reparation, etc. The majority of the current quantitative
   studies on the environmental assessment of AM are based on utilizing the
   knowledge-intensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Further,
   current studies on assessing the environmental performance of AM are
   based on a limited selection of design- or process-related parameters.
   These knowledge barriers may cause delays and challenges in the
   selection of the optimal design and process parameters for additively
   manufactured parts. Such challenges are particularly prevalent during
   the product design and planning stages due to the iterative
   design-evaluation process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated
   LCA tool to support AM toward elevated sustainability. As such, this
   paper provides three main contributions to the research community.
   Firstly, this is the first study to identify a comprehensive set of
   influential AM design and process parameters that pose an impact on the
   environmental performance of AM. Secondly, this review also summarizes
   the impacts of each of these parameters on the environmental
   sustainability of AM. Lastly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no
   work in the literature has been reported on automating LCA for AM. Thus,
   this paper promotes research toward a more environmentally benign and
   innovative AM technology by proposing a new framework to automate the
   environmental assessment of the process. The proposed framework is
   anticipated to take advantage of the fruitful integration between
   Machine Learning (ML) and the product process co-design concept to
   mitigate the challenges and limitations associated with the current
   LCA-based assessment tools.},

Abstract = {As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, the building
   sector is expected to consume even more energy and resources,
   exacerbating environmental damage. Life cycle Inventory Assessment is
   one of the main stages of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it is a
   methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts of buildings and
   other assets on the environment. We propose a literature review for
   examining the potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the
   LCA of buildings. In particular, by incorporating AI into the process,
   it is checked that more accurate predictive modelling is enabled and the
   time needed for data gathering can be reduced. However, it is also noted
   that many challenges remain and must be still addressed, such as the
   need for standardized data and the risk of bias in AI algorithms.
   Despite these latter open challenges, it can be concluded that AI can
   significantly enhance sustainability in the building sector.Highlights

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) lifecycle is a cyclic process to build an
   efficient ML system. Though a lot of commercial and community
   (non-commercial) frameworks have been proposed to streamline the major
   stages in the ML lifecycle, they are normally overqualified and
   insufficient for an ML system in its nascent phase. Driven by real-world
   experience in building and maintaining ML systems, we find that it is
   more efficient to initialize the major stages of ML lifecycle first for
   trial and error, followed by the extension of specific stages to
   acclimatize towards more complex scenarios. For this, we introduce a
   simple yet flexible framework, MLife, for fast ML lifecycle
   initialization. This is built on the fact that data flow in MLife is in
   a closed loop driven by badcases, especially those which impact ML model
   performance the most but also provide the most value for further ML
   model development - a key factor towards enabling enterprises to fast
   track their ML capabilities.},

Abstract = {Considering the gaps in the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   modelling, this article aims to: i) present models that combine AI and
   environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), ii) analyse the role of AI in
   photovoltaics, smart grids and small-island economies. The methodology
   used is based upon selection of publications and analysis. Regarding
   LCA/AI models, the results show that AI can anticipate environmental
   impacts but model performance depends on the amount of data available.
   LCA/AI models can be used for eco-design and decisionmaking. However, it
   is necessary to develop standardised methodologies to evaluate AI
   environmental impacts. Regarding AI and photovoltaics, AI provides
   remarkably interesting applications: design, optimisation and prediction
   of parameters related to different kinds of photovoltaics
   (concentrating, building-integrated, etc.). As for AI and smart grids,
   AI offers advantages such as integration of intermittent renewable
   energy sources and decentralised-grid management. With respect to AI and
   small-island economies, factors such as effective energy storage, energy
   plans and estimation of the degree of susceptibility to disasters are
   important. Generally speaking, and considering the above-mentioned
   issues, it can be argued that AI poses multiple challenges:
   machine-learning models on a large-scale basis; the internet of things;
   options to reduce negative environmental impacts and so on.},

Title = {Techniques and tools for integrating building material stock analysis
   and life cycle assessment at the urban scale: A systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {262},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The urban building stock has a high demand for materials and energy,
   exerting tremendous pressure on natural resources. A current research
   trend is to integrate Building Material Stock (BMS) analysis with Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate energy use, material stock/flows, and
   related environmental performance associated with the life cycle of
   building stocks. Compared with urban building energy modelling (UBEM),
   material-related analysis is a relatively new topic. Some studies
   applied new techniques and tools to improve the modelling and the
   dynamic evolution of the BMS system. However, there is a lack of
   comprehensive review studies summarising the recent publications on
   these applications. Therefore, this study conducts a comprehensive
   literature review, primarily focusing on examining the tools and
   techniques employed for integrating ``BMS-LCA{''}at the urban scale.
   This review includes 99 articles chosen from a pool of 557 related
   papers (in the recent decade), systematically retrieved from Scopus and
   Web of Science , along with additional manual searches. Through a
   comprehensive bibliometric and content-based synthesis analysis of
   selected literature, this paper synthesises the techniques/tools used
   for effectively completing various analysis phases of ``BMS-LCA{''},
   including data collection and processing, stock modelling and analysis,
   and result evaluations. Key findings highlight the significance of
   integrating artificial intelligence and geospatial technology in
   optimising data collection, machine learning and data-driven models in
   enhancing building stock aggregation and classification, and innovative
   application of relevant LCA software and databases in facilitating BMS's
   LCA, etc. This review provides a valuable reference for researchers in

Abstract = {The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon
   emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural
   design decisions play a critical role in a building's carbon footprint,
   making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various
   design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building
   information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon
   architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of
   a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach
   to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It
   combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and
   building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies
   present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first
   case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating
   carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon
   footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use
   of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest
   optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions
   made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the
   form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a
   comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in
   enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design.},

Abstract = {Within the global economy, the built environment makes a major
   contribution to economic activity and has a significant impact on
   sustainability. In addition, the built environment plays a significant
   social role as it influences where we live along with how we work,
   entertain, and learn. Even though the built environment plays such a
   significant social and economic role, it has been slow in adopting
   emerging technologies to make the way we design, build, utilize, and
   decommission more efficient while having less of a negative impact on
   the environment. This paper explores how we can integrate data science
   and Cyber Physical Systems into the built environment to achieve greater
   efficiencies. This paper introduces some of the industry challenges
   along with an overview of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper
   includes qualitative interview data that is driving the development of a
   working model that integrates emerging technologies to achieve budget,
   schedule, and sustainability efficiencies. Finally, the paper discusses
   how it is envisaged that integrating these technologies will improve
   decision-making within the built environment lifecycle.},

Title = {On the Potential of District-Scale Life Cycle Assessments of Buildings},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate neutrality goals in the building sector require a large-scale
   estimation of environmental impacts for various stakeholders. Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is a viable method for this purpose. However, its high
   granularity, and subsequent data requirements and effort, hinder its
   propagation, and potential employment of Machine Learning (ML)
   applications on a larger scale. The presented paper outlines the current
   state of research and practice on district-scale building LCA in terms
   of standards, software and certifications, and data availability. For
   this matter, the authors present the development and application of two
   district-scale LCA tools, Teco and DisteLCA, to determine the Global
   Warming Potential (GWP) of three different residential districts. Both
   tools employ data based on (including, but not limited to) CityGML,
   TABULA, and oKOBAUDAT. The results indicate that DisteLCA's granular
   approach leads to an overestimation of environmental impacts, which can
   be derived from the statistical approach to operational energy use and
   related emissions. While both tools lead to substantial time savings,
   Teco requires less manual effort. The linkage of the aforementioned data
   sources has proven laborious and could be alleviated with a common data
   framework. Furthermore, large-scale data analysis could substantially
   increase the viability of the presented approach.},

Abstract = {Numerous costs are associated with the design, construction,
   installation, operation, maintenance, and deconstruction of a building
   or building system. One of the challenges usually faced by an
   organization's capital planning department and/or facility management
   department is that they do not have an effective means to quickly
   estimate a new facility's whole life-cycle costs (LCC) during the
   programming phase when no building design is available. To provide
   facility managers and owners with an effective and reliable means to
   assess the total cost of the facility ownership, the authors are
   developing an approach that uses the historical data stored in multiple
   building systems and building information models (BIM) as basis to
   predict facilities' LCC-initial design and construction cost, utility
   cost, and operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, the authors
   propose a machine learning-enabled facility LCC analysis framework using
   data provided by building systems. The corresponding domain
   ontology-LCCA-Onto-is also presented. The proposed approach provides
   organizations who own multiple facilities with an innovative solution to
   the LCC prediction issue.},
