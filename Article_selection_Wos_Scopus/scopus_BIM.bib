	abstract = {The construction industry is changing its practices to adapt to its contemporary context. The rise of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is disrupting the way a construction project is thought and managed. To support this evolution, inspiration is taken from manufacturing industries practices which have faced similar challenges. The goal is to develop a more industrialized way to build in order to better manage quality, costs, delays, and to improve working conditions. This article develops the main challenges to face so to achieve this transformation through a literature review. BIM can be compared to the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system in manufacturing fields. BIM could be further developed by changing its unique data structuring into a PLM-inspired organization to adapt representation to the project’s stages and stakeholders needs. Data management also allows more detailed simulations of site operations, highlighting the current planning practices limits. Finally, developing a data-centered approach to manage and produce facilitates early and cross-disciplinary cooperation. This reorganization supports the application of heterodox production methods like off-site construction. As a whole, industrializing construction demands to develop a holistic vision of a facility lifecycle, which can only be developed through better communication and more collaborative practices, bolstered by a more developed digital model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recent international scientific studies have described the current situation regarding CO2 emissions and have provided evidence of its catastrophic short- and medium-term consequences. The implementation of solutions of a more sustainable nature to reduce and mitigate this situation is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, the integration of multi-dimension and life cycle assessment into the design process of buildings can help and support decision making. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is one of the scientific community’s most widely recognized methodologies for this purpose, combining the evaluation of the social, economic, and social dimensions (Triple Bottom Line). One of the main obstacles to implementing this methodology lies in the difficulties in automatically comparing alternative design options for the selection of different materials. To overcome this limitation, the authors developed the BIM3LCA (Building Information Modelling Three Life Cycle Assessment) tool conceived to guide the decision-making process during the early design steps. This study introduces a Building Information Modelling (BIM) plug-in development and validates its application in a case study to support the multi-criteria building material selection based on the LCSA implementation at the early design stage. Three building material alternatives for the structural system of a multi-family residential building are employed to validate this plug-in. The results show the viability of using this tool during the early design stages and demonstrates the consistency of the results regarding the use of the BIM model to conduct the LCSA. The study discusses the benefits and limitations of the BIM3LCA tool. This research contributes towards the integration of multi-dimension real-time assessment in the building design process by using semantically rich BIM models. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the most important target controls in engineering management is construction safety. Because there are annual reports of construction safety accidents in China, traditional safety management should look for breakthroughs. Although many scholars use various methods to improve building safety, they lack the consideration of building life cycle safety planning. Therefore, this paper proposes a life cycle safety management platform based on BIM-4D. The issues with traditional safety management are first examined. Then, in order to address these issues, this paper proposes the use of BIM-4D technology to improve project safety management and exhibits the benefits of this technology in this regard. Following that, a BIM-4D-based life cycle safety management platform is built, followed by a life cycle application process scheme for the management platform, so that all project participants may understand their duties in safety management. The results show that this paper provides a reference for the deepening application of life cycle safety management of construction projects. © 2022 ICCREM 2022: Carbon Peak and Neutrality Strategies of the Construction Industry - Proceedings of the International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management 2022.

	abstract = {Purpose: Infill materials play a pivotal role in determining buildings’ life cycle costing (LCC) and environmental impacts. International standards prescribe LCC and life cycle assessments (LCA) to assess materials’ economic and environmental sustainability. The existing methods of LCC and LCA are tedious and time-consuming, reducing their practical application. This study sought to integrate LCC and LCA with building information modeling (BIM) to develop a swift and efficient approach for evaluating the life cycle performance of infill materials. Design/methodology/approach: The BIM model for a case study was prepared using Autodesk Revit®, and the study included four infill materials (lightweight aggregate concrete block (LECA), autoclaved cellular concrete (AAC), concrete masonry and bricks). LCC was conducted using Revit® and Autodesk Insight 360® to estimate costs incurred across different project phases. LCA was conducted using “One Click LCA®,” a BIM-based platform featuring a comprehensive material inventory. Carbon emissions, acidification, and eutrophication were chosen as environmental impact factors for LCA. Findings: LECA was the preferred choice due to its lower cost and environmental impact. Its lifetime cost of $440,618 was 5.4% lower than bricks’, with 2.8% lower CO2 emissions than AAC’s, which were second-place options, respectively. LECA had 6.4 and 27% lower costs than concrete blocks, and AAC’s carbon emissions were 32 and 58% lower than concrete blocks and bricks, respectively. Originality/value: BIM has been employed for life cycle analysis in existing literature, but its efficacy in evaluating the lifetime costs and environmental impacts of infill materials remains unexplored. The current study presents a BIM-based approach for conducting LCC and LCA of infill materials, facilitating informed decision-making during the planning phase and promoting sustainable construction practices. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The construction industry consumes a large number of resources and energy, producing a negative impact on the environment. Nowadays, the world is facing problems of climate change, ozone layer depletion, temperature rises, etc. with an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In India to get an environment clearance certificate for any project, environmental impact assessment is most important, which is measured by means of life cycle impact assessment. The aim of this research work is to measure the impact of various building materials by evaluating energy consumption at different stages throughout the life span of the building. This work follows a life cycle assessment framework based on the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 guidelines within the available databases using Autodesk Revit (building information modelling tool) and One-Click LCA (life cycle assessment tool) integration. The main objectives of the research work are: (1) to compare concrete frame structure and steel frame structure; (2) to compare conventional and modern building materials, on the basis of their environmental impact. To achieve the objectives of the work, a real-life case study of the residential apartment building is selected and analysis of energy consumption is done. The results from the energy consumption calculation indicate that steel frame with modern building materials produces a less negative impact on the environment as compared to concrete frame and conventional building material. This research work is limited to the environmental impact of building frame type and material selection during the early design phase of the building. It encourages the application of steel frames as well as modern building materials to protect the natural environment and climate change. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Buildings consume a significant amount of energy and resources during all stages of their life cycle, causing enormous environmental impacts. Life cycle energy analysis is a holistic approach to estimating the energy performance of buildings with respect to their designed energy efficiency. This paper aims to ascertain the state of research on the life cycle energy analysis of buildings to formulate a strategic framework for reducing the energy footprint of the building sector. The study is conducted through the explorative method of research using a systematic review approach. The material for the systematic review is selected from five scientific databases through a rigorous and structured process. Findings indicate that the current methods of life cycle energy estimation are tedious and resource-intensive, requiring numerous, incomplete inventory databases and energy simulation tools that require a user interface. Moreover, the lack of explicit guidelines or standards for life cycle energy estimation causes large variations in the results, thus making the comparison between different studies unrealistic. Further, recent trends reveal the use of methods such as the multi-regional input-output method, multi-objective optimisation, multi-criteria decision-making, data analytics, and the increasing relevance of building information modelling (BIM) for energy calculations and evaluation of design alternatives. The review points to the urgent need for developing a comprehensive and integrated knowledge base and standards for life cycle energy analysis of buildings, starting from the early design stage. Finally, the study proposes a strategic framework for reducing energy demand in the building sector for stakeholder implementation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Selecting a suitable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is critical, because it impacts a building’s life cycle cost (LCC). Several factors affect the selection decision, such as quality, buildability, internal and external building appearance, HVAC size and weight, and LCC. These criteria are difficult to measure, as they are not based on agreed measurement units. Another challenging factor in the selection process is assessing the building’s function/performance and determining its HVAC needs. Currently, the decision depends mostly on expert knowledge, and there is no agreed-upon systematic method to follow. This paper aims to develop a systematic model for selecting HVAC systems based on the value engineering (VE) concept. The model identified fourteen criteria based on an agreed standard test for objective criteria and a typical evaluation for subjective criteria. These HVAC criteria were assessed using a combination of the AHP, pair-wise, function analysis system (FAST), and Monte Carlo techniques. As a result, a complete model was developed to enhance the selection process, programmed within the building information modeling (BIM) environment platform. Several HVAC experts were interviewed and more than twenty expert opinions were collected to validate the model. In addition, a case study building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was implemented using the programmed HVAC selection model for validation purposes. The programmed model can significantly facilitate the selection process for designers. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Prefabricated buildings are adopted in the construction industry because they are more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and faster to construct and provide higher quality and safety. The most essential and recognizable aspect of prefabricated buildings is precast components. Precast component management is still inefficient, and precast manufacturing efficiency is inadequate. The precast component lifecycle must be managed because the designers, manufacturing producers, and on-site installers are all from separate regions. Some of the most recent technologies include the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time visibility and traceability, Cloud Computing for data management, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for digital presentations and quality management, significantly reducing precast component lifecycle management difficulties in prefabricated buildings. BIM seems to be a model based information-sharing approach that allows multiple key stakeholders to collaborate on 3D BIM models. Cloud services enable project stakeholders to collaborate through the Internet and make decisions quickly from any location. RFID is an IoT technology that allows project stakeholders to monitor and track precast components in real time. Integrating BIM with RFID and Cloud technology enables the project stakeholders to access real-time information on precast components and prefabrication building lifecycle management. Therefore, this research study highlighted challenges in the life cycle management of precast components in prefabricated buildings and proposed a framework based on Internet of Things–Cloud–Building Information Modeling. The data flow model and information management systems are also described. Throughout the lifecycle of the precast component and the prefabricated building, this framework would improve real-time information communication among both the precast manufacturer and the construction project site so there will be no travel or duration gaps. Prefabricated component and building lifecycle information may be tracked, and cost, quality, schedule, and safety management will be monitored. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {CO2 emissions have become a part of common vocabulary as a result of the significant negative effects of climate change. Through the supply of buildings and infrastructure for the smooth operation of a business, the construction sector plays a vital role in the growth of an economy, both directly and indirectly. However, due to carbon emissions from materials and energy, this business is currently facing significant challenges. Prefabrication has grown in popularity in nations as a result of its several benefits, including quality control, waste minimization, onsite and offshore parallel to coordination, and so. It’s also been identified as a crucial approach for reducing carbon emissions caused by buildings. However, there has been little study into reducing carbon emissions in prefabrication through the use of advanced technical artefacts such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), which are emerging from the technology realm. The goal of this article is to provide a BIM-based method for calculating carbon with the usage of the PLCA method. During the materialization stage of a prefabricated construction project, there is a decrease. Partial Life-cycle Assessment (PLCA) is an efficient and effective technique for estimating carbon emissions from new building construction, according to the study’s findings, and prefabrication reduces carbon emissions when applied. After computation, the comparison is being done using the Monte Carlo simulation to find the percentage difference and this software helps to find the iteration for different scenarios. The study adds to the corpus of knowledge on carbon emissions reduction through prefabrication. Contractors, house buyers, and authorities who are continually looking for methods to build a circular economy should be aware of life cycle assessment of CO2 . In this study, we are exploring how pre-fabricated structures are the need of the future and their usefulness to the very extent to determine the emissions at the production, transportation and construction phases of the building life cycle. And determine the amount of CO2 emissions in the pre-fabricated structure by comparing it with the cast in situ and to differentiate the result by creating a simulation through Monte Carlo analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

However, the state of LCCA based on BIM is unclear despite previously published works. Therefore, this paper aims to address this gap by reviewing 45 relevant peer-reviewed articles through a systematic literature search, selection, and assessment. The results show that three data exchange methods integrate BIM and LCCA through data input, calculation, and output. Precision management, optimization measures, and parameter analysis through BIM significantly improve the value of buildings. Also, a methodological framework is summarized that combines LCC with other indicators based on BIM to consider eco-nomic, environmental, and social impacts, which can be monetized to assess life cycle sustainability costs.

	abstract = {The paper presents the development process of an innovative, prefabricated compact house, which aims at creating a net zero greenhouse gas emission building design over the whole life cycle. Building Information Modelling helped to quantify the required building materials. Dynamic building simulations were performed in DesignBuilder to calculate the energy demand of the building for the operational period. To evaluate the financial feasibility and the carbon balance of the building, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were used. A heat and moisture transfer simulation was carried out to provide a more accurate analysis and to identify possible moisture problems. The assessment showed that the ratio of embodied impacts and operational impacts is typically 1:2 for wooden buildings and 1:1.5 for brick buildings. Life cycle carbon neutrality could be achieved in both cases with additional photovoltaic panels installed on the roof. However, a major difference between timber and brick buildings is the time factor: while the initial emissions from the production of brick buildings are gradually offset with excess solar energy, timber buildings act as carbon storage with negative emissions over the study period and the carbon is only released at the eventual end-of-life stage. The necessary size of photovoltaics is largely influenced by the avoided grid impact: if dynamic decarbonization of the electricity mix is considered, the size of photovoltaics required is about 1.5 times larger to offset the environmental load of the construction due to the diminishing benefits. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Given the complexity and interconnection of different aspects involved in building evaluation, one of the most relevant, and challenging, research topics is the integration of different domain models (such as thermal comfort, indoor environmental quality and occupant comfort) to effectively describe and inform improvement strategies for the behaviour and performance of a building and building stock. Currently, this problem is unsolved with only one study attempting to integrate building energy simulation and life cycle assessments (separately, both practices are utilised to facilitate the design and management of buildings, traditionally consultancies offer building energy simulation services – most commonly for regulatory purposes – and more recently life cycle impact assessments), whilst no work has attempted this integration in a dynamic manner. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic, open building information modelling based co-simulation architecture. This architecture is the first to tightly couple and integrate EnergyPlus and Brightway2, in a way that does not rely upon heuristics or simplified tools. Furthermore, it is the first building energy simulation and life cycle assessment co-simulation to enable time-differentiated (dynamic) results and the first to be enabled only by open technologies. The architecture has been validated against two case-study non-domestic buildings located in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg, demonstrating its applicability to the construction and operational life cycle phases of buildings. The work presented in this paper has shown how a time-differentiated co-simulation approach across energy and lifecycle domains enables a more holistic analysis of whole buildings with greater accuracy and granularity. © 2023 The Authors},

This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling has reached a certain level of maturity in the field of vertical constructions, but it is still in an initial phase in the field of horizontal ones as transport infrastructures. This is due to the lack of a proper format for data interchange, capable of representing all the peculiarities of such constructions, like the wide extension of the model over a surface and its very heterogeneous components. In recent years, this gap has been partially bridged with the development of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format for different categories of transport infrastructures, as also for the railway infrastructure sector. The goal of this work is to assess the maturity of the available tools and the difficulties concerning the project management of transport infrastructures using Building Information Modeling software in the design phase with special attention to interoperability of the data. The authors focused their attention on the identification of a new railway layout in Italy (Padua - Chioggia connection), through the implementation of an information flow between different software tools to test the information exchange and the export of data in the IFC 4x3 standard format. Starting from the definition of the territorial constraints, the geometric parameters, the unit costs and the railway service of the project, a set of design alternatives was generated. Through the railway line life-cycle cost and a decision-making analysis, the optimal solution was identified among the various track layouts. The several issues related to different software packages demonstrate that the information exchange for horizontal constructions is still far from reaching a good degree of maturity, especially regarding the lack of a univocal transfer of information. To spread the Building Information Modeling methodology as a standard for infrastructure design, it is required to overcome these technical obstacles to get a collaborative work process. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Investigating Industry 4.0 technologies and studying their impacts on various aspects of the construction industry, including stakeholders and the lifecycle, is vital to enhance novel applications of such technologies in an industry that is known as Construction 4.0. The main objective of the current state-of-the-art review is to provide a comprehensive literature review on three widely used Industry 4.0 technologies, Building Information Modeling (BIM), Blockchain, and LiDAR, which have strong potential to promote and optimize different activities of the project, and also, the integration of them can greatly impact the construction industry in the whole project lifecycle. A bibliometric analysis of keyword co-occurrence and citations revealed a significant number of publications from 2014 to 2023 investigating the selected technologies. Recent trends indicate that the majority of papers have considered the selected technologies in the integration with each other. However, a specific gap exists in the literature regarding the interactions and potential synergies among these technologies. This gap limits the understanding of how these integrations can address challenges unique to the construction industry and hinders the development of comprehensive solutions. The review has been analyzed and discussed in reference to the type of article, single or multi technologies, the lifecycle, and their applications. The study showed that the integration of BIM, Blockchain, and LiDAR, as a recent trend and as a beneficial solution to automate the whole construction process, has considerable capacities to improve the productivity of the construction industry. Finally, some application areas for the integration of these three technologies are concluded and are suggested, and therefore, an advantageous reference has been provided for scholars to plan their future research in this sector. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Dealing with and maintaining high-quality standards in the design and construction phases is challenging, especially for on-site construction. Issues like improper implementation of building components and poor communication can widen the gap between design specifications and actual conditions. To prevent this, particularly for energy-efficient buildings, it is vital to develop resilient, sustainable strategies. These should optimize resource use, minimize environmental impact, and enhance livability, contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and climate change mitigation. Traditional post-occupancy evaluations, which identify defects after construction, are impractical for addressing energy performance gaps. A new, real-time inspection approach is necessary throughout the construction process. This paper suggests an innovative guideline for prefabricated buildings, emphasizing digital ‘self-instruction’ and ‘self-inspection’. These procedures ensure activities impacting quality adhere to specific instructions, drawings, and 3D models, incorporating the relevant acceptance criteria to verify completion. This methodology, promoting alignment with planned energy-efficient features, is supported by BIM-based software and Augmented Reality (AR) tools, embodying Industry 4.0 principles. BIM (Building Information Modeling) and AR bridge the gap between virtual design and actual construction, improving stakeholder communication and enabling real-time monitoring and adjustments. This integration fosters accuracy and efficiency, which are key for energy-efficient and nearly zero-energy buildings, marking a shift towards a more precise, collaborative, and environmentally sensible construction industry. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) helps simplify data acquisition and reduce labor-intensive processes in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings. However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of integrating BIM into LCA. This paper aims to develop a framework for systematically reviewing the body of knowledge on BIM-integrated LCA in the concept, methodology, and value dimensions. Following the framework, this paper analyzes case studies involving 82 buildings from selected publications between 2011 and 2021, using scientometric and detailed content analysis techniques. The results evidence that the majority of them were studies of residential, low-rise, and concrete buildings and used Autodesk Revit for establishing BIM models. Three types of methods for BIM-integrated LCA were identified: integrating data into a third-party application or tool (I), importing a bill of quantities report generated from the BIM model into a dedicated LCA tool (II), and using plug-ins with LCA data for BIM software (III). However, interoperability between BIM and LCA remains a serious challenge owing to different terminologies and data structures. Hence, two means have been suggested to improve this: adapting the BIM data to the LCA data structure and developing a simpler BIM tool. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for better understanding “what BIM-integrated LCA is”, “how to integrate BIM with LCA to simplify and automate data input”, and “what applications of BIM-integrated LCA are”. It also serves as an information base for researchers and software developers to identify the contemporary research trends and knowledge gaps in this discipline. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The combination of building information modeling and life cycle assessment leads to improve the environmental performance of buildings. However, preliminary measures to achieve sustainability require complete knowledge and classification of building information modeling uses and environmental indicators. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify and prioritize building information modeling capabilities and environmental indicators in the early stages of design. A questionnaire was designed to survey experts in this field. By evaluating the building information modeling criteria and life cycle evaluation, using the Structural equation modeling method, it was found that 3D coordination, Phase planning, and Design reviews are the most important in the success of the project. In terms of life cycle assessment, control, and reduction indicators of Global Warming Potential, Land use impact, and Total Primary Energy, it has the greatest impact on improving the sustainable performance of a construction project. We also examined the interaction between the most effective building information modeling criteria and life cycle evaluation using the Delphi method.

	abstract = {Due to our increasing dependence on resources and energy, climate change is among the most tangible issues we are facing today. The construction industry has been identified as a key sector to intervene in, but mitigation strategies must focus on more than just operational energy. As current climate policies recommend, designers should consider the broader framework of environmental impacts characterizing the entire building lifecycle. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considers the mentioned aspects. Nevertheless, the complexity of LCA and the criticalities of related tools prevent the application of the approach during decisive early stages. Additionally, LCA allows the estimation of environmental issues, but fails to describe other dimensions of sustainability. The article proposes an evaluation method to support decision-making during the design of sustainable buildings. The method exploits the LCA tool and the assessment framework provided by a Green Sustainable Building Certification (Active House) integrated with BIM. The approach was applied and proven through a case study: a residential single-family building in northern Italy, comparing two technological options. The study confirmed the effectiveness of the multicriteria evaluation framework that, from the early design stage, can be used to measure the environmental impact of buildings alongside implications for the final users’ comfort. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, the sector's adherence to traditional methods for infrastructure design and management has delayed the widespread adoption of BIM. This paper describes a BIM-centered methodology applied to a real-world High-Speed Railway Line (HSRL) project. Through an extensive examination of HSRL design parameters and the integration of various BIM-based tools, a 3D parametric design model is generated. This model serves as the foundation for evaluating up to five design alternatives, considering technical and economic aspects. Furthermore, a degradation model is proposed to assess alternative performance over the infrastructure's full lifecycle under specific rail traffic assumptions. This facilitates a rapid evaluation of alignment design's impact on maintenance costs. The paper draws two main conclusions with potential benefits for both private companies and railway administrations: Firstly, BIM proves feasible and advantageous despite some interoperability challenges, highlighting the need for continued advancements in BIM software compatibility. Secondly, the proposed approach can potentially lead to up to 40% cost savings in maintenance for railway administrations. © 2023},

	abstract = {A surge in energy demand driven by the growing number of buildings and insufficient attention to sustainable and optimised energy-saving procedures are likely to threaten the economy and the environment. The building envelope is a significant component that influences energy requirements, directly affecting the operations costs. Thus, the current study considers the envelope to optimise the building’s Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and enhance energy efficiency. Therefore, to achieve the aim of the study, Building Information Modelling (BIM) with the integration of Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is adopted to assess the building envelope and optimise energy use and relevant costs. Three alternatives of wall system: brick wall with rockwool insulation, brick wall with polystyrene insulation and curtain walls system, are considered for the building envelope to enhance energy-saving potential by analysing and comparing the energy demand. To determine LCCA, the Net Present Value (NPV) approach was adopted for the initial expenditure and the associated future costs. It was found that utilising insulation material with low thermal conductivity reduces heating and cooling energy resulting optimised LCC. Compared to curtain walls, the results show that the rockwool insulated wall reduces 17% of energy demand while the polystyrene wall reduces 12.7% of the energy. Similarly, rockwool insulated walls save 5% energy relative to the wall system with polystyrene insulation. Thus, integrating LCCA with the BIM approach at the conceptual design stages promotes energy and LCC optimisation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

This study proposes an approach integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and building and information modelling (BIM) to quantify the possible life-cycle formwork waste reduction through prefabrication from a construction project, in which LCA serves as a systematic assessment framework and BIM provides the basic inventory for LCA. A typical reinforced concrete frame structural building located in Nanjing, China is chosen for a case study to demonstrate and validate the proposed approach. Results show that prefabrication can reduce formwork waste by 59.68%-71.83%, which mainly comes from straight walls and slabs. This figure can continuously increase to as high as 90% if the prefabrication is further applied and promoted. Findings from this study contribute to the understanding of the environmental benefits of prefabrication.

	abstract = {The significance of environmental management of existing buildings in reducing the environmental impact of the construction sector is increasingly emphasized. However, life-cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate a building's environmental burden requires considerable time and costs for the collection and interpretation of data needed for analysis. Therefore, this study proposed an integrated assessment framework of economic, environmental, and human health impacts using scan-to-building information modeling (BIM) and LCA in existing buildings. To verify the proposed framework, a case study was conducted. A BIM model with an error rate of 1.442% can be automatically generated from the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud using parametric algorithm. The total cost for the target case was calculated at USD 162,769, and the environmental cost accounted for the largest percentage at 97.15%. The developed framework in this study holds significance because it enables the automated assessment of economic, environmental, and human health impacts of existing buildings through the integration of BIM and LCA. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for a large portion of global energy consumption and carbon emissions. Improvements in building design contribute to reducing environmental impacts of buildings. In this context, a crucial issue is to understand which design variables should be considered while which variables could be negligible. The objective of this study is to develop a framework for assessing the influence of various design variables throughout the design process in the environmental impacts of a building over its life cycle. This methodological framework combined building information modelling and life cycle assessment tools and a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris elementary effects method. A residential building was applied to demonstrate the developed framework. The influence of six design variables in early design stages (including, floor area, aspect ratio, floor height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio and number of floors), nine variables in detailed design stages (including, structure type of external and internal walls, type of insulation material for external and internal walls, insulation material for floors, waterproofing and insulation material for roof, type of window frame, and glazing type), and four variables in construction design stages (including, type of finishing for external walls, internal walls and floors, and roof tiles) are examined. Three environmental impact criteria (including, embodied, operational, and life-cycle environmental impacts) of a building are considered. The results identified the most influential variables throughout the design process, highlighting aspect ratio in early design stage, the structure and insulation materials for walls in detailed design stages, and the roof title in construction design stages. The outcomes of this research can assist in understanding the importance of design variables in each design stage throughout the design process of a building. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

With more joint applications of both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite the transition towards a circular economy (CE) being a significant element in achieving the decarbonisation of the built environment, a clear and common pathway to applying CE principles to building design is still lacking in both industry practice and academia. The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has the potential to enable the identification of feasible pathways to increase circularity. This study aims to investigate its practical use to facilitate the application of circular economy principles at the early stage of building design via using LCA-based BIM plugins. Within this aim, the paper centres on a co-production approach and presents a gap analysis by identifying gaps in knowledge and implementation as well as addressing the pressing needs of the current practice in the UK. A series of semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners in the field were conducted for data collection, contributing to the following phases of the co-production by allowing for an in-depth investigation and reflection of the practice. The findings have revealed that: (a) there is still an insufficient level of contextual awareness and readiness in the implementation of CE principles in the built environment and LCA understanding and (b) the adoption of BIM at the early stages of building design is still limited in the current practice; BIM models with sufficient level of data details and quality to enable circularity assessment are rarely produced. Thus, the paper highlights the need for enabling mechanisms, including the introduction of legislative instruments, the involvement and commitment of the industry and key stakeholders, the support for training and skills improvement, and the establishment of effective communication and implementation process management frameworks. Future research agenda points to the need of formulation of a BIM protocol to enable integration of BIM and LCA to promote CE principles in the building design process. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry representing a significant share of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, developing sustainable design and reducing buildings’ environmental impacts has become a priority over the past decades. Adopting building information modeling tools and implementing them into life cycle analysis techniques at the early stages of design has been an effective method for buildings sustainability evaluation. With our environment constantly changing, it is reasonable that the construction industry should also aim to adapt to these changes and use them. However, the role of local climate features and their effects on a building's energy output is often neglected. By using building information modeling–life cycle analysis integration techniques, this research aims to consider the role of climatic attributes along with some passive design strategies in the life cycle assessment of the building and see how it affects that building's energy performance. By only applying passive design strategies (not including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system type), the models’ energy demand was reduced up to 30% of the original value. It is also witnessed that by using the proper equipment and construction materials that match the respective climate, up to 28% of the building's energy consumption during the operational phase, can be saved. Although insulation of the walls does reduce energy consumption values, it also contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions was estimated to be around 3%, but since the insulation boards make up only 2% of the building's area, it is a considerable amount. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {The construction sector is liable for a sizable amount of CO2 emissions and waste. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered one of the crucial tools that aids in evaluating the impacts of construction emissions. This research aims to quantify the life cycle impacts of the initial and recurrent embodied emissions, operating and reuse/disposal emissions, and utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) for a more holistic life cycle approach. The research proposes a parametric BIM-based LCA framework for quantifying the environmental impacts and evaluating the effects of material selection for both embodied and operating emissions. In addition, it considers the different reuse scenarios and percentages and their effect on both the embodied and operating impacts. The proposed framework consists of five main modules: data acquisition module, operating and embodied emissions module, life cycle assessment module, optimization module, and decision-making module. This parametric assessment can be applied for both the conventional and circular approach impacts. For the decision-making process, the resulting emissions are optimized utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and evaluated through an LCA and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology for the material selection. A case study of a residential villa in Cairo is worked out to illustrate the key features of the proposed framework. This assessment analyzes the building materials’ characteristics and efficiency investigating the external walls, internal walls, floors, roofs, and windows design possibilities, and uses visual programming to control the resulting emissions for a more flexible approach. By comparing the integrated LCA and DEA models three optimum design solutions, the conventional approach develops design solutions of higher embodied Global Warming Potential (GWP) than the circular approach. However, it develops lower operating GWP with better applied U-values. The circularity approach employment has reduced the efficiency of the operating GWP due to utilizing materials with high heat transmittance ability. © 2023},

	abstract = {The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its corresponding methodologies gained considerable attention within the realm of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability assessment. Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate the extent to which these methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods, economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of 144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning sustainability assessment. © 2024 The Author(s).

This article proposes a workflow for the enhancement of these management processes based on BIM (Building Information Modelling), a methodology capable of integrating architectural information into a three-dimensional graphic model. The proposed workflow defines the basic characteristics of the BIM model oriented toward sustainable building management and its relationship with the key moments of its life cycle. It also analyzes the architectural information associated with the models and determines which parameters are optimal for their completion from the BIM models in terms of reliability, auditability, and automation.

	abstract = {The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has emerged in recent years to facilitate the use of Building Information Modeling during the entire projects' lifecycle. In the DT concept, cyber-physical system theory is utilized to collect condition data about an existing asset and then integrate this data into the digital model. The major limitation though is that the current scope of DT is limited to the operation and maintenance phase. Nevertheless, the DT concept can be extended to the entire lifecycle of the asset if the relevant sensory and non-sensory data are incorporated into the digital model in an automated and systematic way. However, in the current literature, there is no clear insight about such a holistic and life-cycle DT concept for infrastructure projects. Especially, there is very little understanding about how various sensory and non-sensory data from construction and operation phases can be seamlessly integrated into the 3D BIM models. Therefore, this research aims to develop a conceptual model for the architecture of Lifecycle DT (LDT) focusing on bridges. To this end, an ontological modeling approach is adopted. The proposed ontology is validated through a workshop session where domain experts assessed the results with respect to some competency questions. The outcome of the session indicated that the proposed ontology scored sufficiently in all the criteria and succeeded in satisfying the information needs of the LDT. Overall, the proposed model offers an insight into a lifecycle modeling practice as well as automated data incorporation, enabling a smooth transition towards an upgraded modeling practice. © 2022 International Association on Automation and Robotics in Construction.},

In the process of its rapid development, environmental problems have become increasingly prominent, and the depletion of resources and energy has threatened human survival. Countries all over the world have put forward the concept of green energy conservation to seek the harmony between architecture and nature. Green building is an inevitable choice under the background of China's commitment to developing low-carbon and circular economy. In the process of green building development, there are some problems, such as information fault and poor coordination among specialties. Therefore, the green theory has not been fully applied in the actual process.

	abstract = {The optimal structural design is imperative in order to minimize material consumption and reduce the environmental impacts of construction. Given the complexity in the formulation of structural design problems, the process of optimization is commonly performed using artificial intelligence (AI) global optimization, such as the genetic algorithm (GA). However, the integration of AI-based optimization, together with visual programming (VP), in building information modeling (BIM) projects warrants further investigation. This study proposes a workflow by combining structure analysis, VP, BIM, and GA to optimize trusses. The methodology encompasses several steps, including the following: (i) generation of parametric trusses in Dynamo VP; (ii) performing finite element modeling (FEM) using Robot Structural Analysis (RSA); (iii) retrieving and evaluating the FEM results interchangeably between Dynamo and RSA; (iv) finding the best solution using GA; and (v) importing the optimized model into Revit, enabling the user to perform simulations and engineering analysis, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantity surveying. This methodology provides a new interoperable framework with minimal interference with existing supply-chain processes, and it will be flexible to technology literacy and allow architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals to employ VP, global optimization, and FEM in BIM-based projects by leveraging open-sourced software and tools, together with commonly used design software. The feasibility of the proposed workflow was tested on benchmark problems and compared with the open literature. The outcomes of this study offer insight into the opportunities and limitations of combining VP, GA, FEA, and BIM for structural optimization applications, particularly to enhance structural efficiency and sustainability in construction. Despite the success of this study in developing a workable, user-friendly, and interoperable framework for the utilization of VP, GA, FEM, and BIM for structural optimization, the results obtained could be improved by (i) increasing the callback function speed between Dynamo and RSA through specialized application programming interface (API); and (ii) fine-tuning the GA parameters or utilizing other advanced global optimization and supervised learning techniques for the optimization. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention in the global construction sector due to their potential to reduce construction time, improve process efficiency, save resources, and mitigate pollution. It is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi-information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77 kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively, with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11%, while the transportation and construction phases contribute 3.30% and 0.59% of the total emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of prefabricated construction can lead to a 31.62% reduction in total GHG emissions per square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings. These findings can serve as practical references for future research to achieve the construction industry's green and low-carbon goals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper aims to propose an approach using BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calculate and analyze the carbon emissions in different stages of building lifecycle of affordable housing named 'social housing'. For this purpose, an affordable housing parcel containing full-residential and mixed-use buildings was considered as a case study. Consequently, beside emphasizing the BIM capability to facilitate Embodied Carbon (EC) emissions, this study revealed that, concrete, bricks, steel, ceramic tiles, and paint are the most contributing materials in emitted EC with an approximative share of 90%. Meantime, glass is an impactful material for mixed-use buildings as it contributes to 8% of the total EC. Furthermore, this paper discloses that for social housing, the operational stage contributes to 98% of the BLCCE where 73% among it is due only to fossil energy consumption (butane), and full-residential buildings produce 11.6% more BLCCE than mixed-use buildings. © 2022 International Conference on Construction in the 21st Century.

An interpretive structural modelling approach and Matrice d’Impacts croises-multipication applique a classement (MICMAC) analysis were adopted for this study. Nineteen key drivers were categorized into a seven-level ISM model, which revealed that the successful implementation of the driving factors for BIM-based LCSA would increase its adoption and encourage users to be proactive in exploring solutions, exerting best efforts, and advancing its usage. The primary drivers, such as organizational readiness, personal willingness to use, procurement methods, and organizational structure, amongst others, are crucial for discussing BIM-based LCSA adoption strategies and making guidelines and design decisions to guide the process. This paper therefore contributes to the growing discussion on BIM from the viewpoint of an assessment of a building’s life cycle sustainability.

The complexity of optimizing multiple performance indicators using BIM has hindered its widespread adoption in design practice, confining its application primarily to academic research. Therefore, this paper reviewed 168 previous studies from the past ten years, conducted an in-depth review and comparison, and provides suggestions for possible future research direction for BIM research. Specifically, the paper systematically reviews the application of BIM in design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofit and demolition, and all the assessment phases of green buildings, and discusses the advantages of the BIM application in green buildings as well as an analysis of the current research gaps. This research enhances practitioners’ understanding of BIM and green buildings’ current trends and development status.

This scientific publication focuses on the application of a BIM-based research methodology to analyse the carbon footprint of a single-family house. The research process included the following steps: (i) the design of a single-family house with masonry construction using Archicad 26, BIM programme, (ii) simulation of the building energy performance using the EcoDesigner Star plug-in, (iii) LCA using the plug-in for Archicad, (iv) preparation of a second model with timber-frame construction for comparison, and (v) comparative analysis of the single-family house models with masonry construction (building A) and timber-frame (building B). Analysis of the results highlights significant differences in CO2e emissions between buildings and the varying impact of individual elements on the total CO2e emissions of the buildings studied. Building A had significantly higher net emissions, amounting to 43,226.94 kg CO2e, in stark contrast to Building B’s significantly lower 13,522.13 kg CO2e. This discrepancy was also mirrored in the emission intensity, with Building A emitting at a rate of 281.06 kg CO2e/m2 compared to Building B’s 96.72 kg CO2e/m2. These findings are relevant for future work on sustainable building design and construction aiming to minimise negative environmental impacts. The goal of minimising the cumulative carbon footprint of buildings is critical to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and combating climate change. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Currently, owners find it difficult to manage their assets throughout their project life cycle. The fact that asset information models (AIMs) are mandatory as deliverables for building information modeling-driven projects makes it a key requirement for the client to understand in detail those factors affecting asset operation. Hence, because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most significant market in the Middle East, this study aims to investigate those factors where blockchain and AIMs could impact the asset management (AM) life cycle. Design/methodology/approach: Researchers used a hypothesis-based approach over a systematic literature review and a workshop (descriptive statistics) to understand the current challenges in AM. Later, a second workshop was run to understand the impact factor analysis affecting the operation of the asset life cycle by using asset information modeling and blockchain technology over a multiquantitative method. Findings: Results found that factors affecting the operation of assets could be the improvement of trust and stakeholder’s influences; the availability of handover process products’ accurate data; manufacturers providing detailed product models; increasing the speed of preparing holistic and integrated AM systems; improving collaboration between stakeholders; and returning clients’ investments faster. Originality/value: Understanding the factors affecting AM life cycle based on the utilization of AIMs and blockchain then allows investors and their team members to work in a secure and collaborative environment that helps them to pre-identify certain risks and improve decision-making in a more effective way, as is required by ISO55000. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Large amounts of semi-structured three-dimensional geometric data of buildings are usually available today, but the topological relationships are rarely explicitly described and thus not directly usable with computational methods of AI. To this end, we propose methods for indexing spatial configurations inspired by the similarity analysis of incomplete human fingerprints, since the early design stage of architectural design is characterized by incomplete information. For this, the topology of spatial configurations is extracted from Building Information Modelling (BIM) data and represented as graphs.

By leveraging the digitalisation offered in the construction sector via the use of BIM, it will be possible to effectively monitor the use of CRMs in a BIM-enabled construction project. BIM covers the entire life cycle of a building, including the monitoring of quantities and related processes of CRMs. This extends from preparatory and construction phases to maintenance, demolition, and end-of-life stages. Extending further, and towards monitoring in a more holistic approach the material and waste journey before or after the BIM coverage, the integration of a Life Cycle Assessment could cover the entire CRM journey in the construction sector and beyond (mining, manufacturing, recycling, etc.). This direct access to information will allow for (i) a better understanding of the use of CRMs in the construction sector, (ii) improved material management and collection of critical raw material-rich waste, (iii) more informed decision-making across all involved actors, and (iv) evidence-based policy-making regarding primary and secondary CRMs in the construction sector and beyond.  © 2024 University of Split, FESB.},

	abstract = {The construction sector is one of the fastest-growing in the world and significantly contributes to economic growth. To maximize profits without sacrificing quality, the concept of a successful building project should be applied throughout the different stages of a project's lifecycle. Although the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been lacking to a large extent in developing nations, a lot of studies have been done on BIM usage, awareness, barriers and drivers. However, no research has been done on the impact of the BIM barriers onBIM usage frequency in the project lifecycle. The research assesses the extent of influence of overcoming BIM implementation barriers (BIMIBs) on the BIM usage frequency (BF) at the different stages of the building lifecycle in the developing world. The study created a conceptual model based on a thorough literature review after which, a questionnaire survey which collected data from 103 professionals in the Ghanaian construction industry was used to perform a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis. The structural model adapted 14 attributes across 4 major BIMIBs namely Organizational (OB), Cost (CB), Technical (TB) and People (PB) related barriers as well as 7 attributes across 3 phase factors namely the Pre-Construction (UP), Construction (UC) and Post Construction (UPC) phases. In order of significance, the study identified TB, PB, OB and CB as the most critical BIM implementation barriers that require urgent attention in the developing world with path coefficient values of 0.359, 0.314, 0.238 and 0.199 respectively. Also, with a path coefficient value of 0.848, the PLS-SEM results revealed a positive and substantial influence of ‘overcoming BIMIBs(U)’ on BIM usage(U) in the project lifecycle among professionals in the AEC industry of the developing world. Furthermore, the study discovered that, BF at UP ranked first followed by UC and UPC with scores of 0.894, 0.855 and 0.803 respectively. Lastly, the conceptual, empirical, managerial and theoretical implications of the model prediction were examined. Increasing the delivery of waste-efficient BIM-enabled projects within the built environment by overcoming the identified critical BIMIBs in the developing world is a major contribution of the study to the idea of the circular economy. In addition, the study's findings will serve as a guide for researchers, professionals, and academics in the developing world as they work to overcome BIM barriers and to promote BIM usage throughout the project lifecycle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The construction and building sector is one of the largest contributors to the global carbon emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to accurately assess the carbon emissions of buildings throughout the life cycle. Many studies conducted life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings to evaluate carbon emissions. However, due to the lack of dynamic data, most studies adopted the static LCA methodology, which neglected the dynamic variations during life cycle stages of a building. Unlike previous studies that collected static data from questionnaires and documents, the present study aims to establish a novel dynamic life cycle assessment (D-LCA) framework for buildings by incorporating the building information modeling (BIM) and the building energy modeling program (BEMP) into the static LCA. First, a static LCA is established as the baseline scenario that covers the “cradle-to-grave” life cycle stages. A BIM model is established using Revit to obtain the inventory of building materials. The Designer Simulation Toolkit (DeST) is used as a BEMP to simulate the operating energy consumption of the studied building, taking into account changes in energy mix, climate change, and occupant behavior. At the same time, the DeST results are further used as a data input for dynamic scenarios. The D-LCA framework is applied to a high-rise commercial building in China. This study found that the difference between static and dynamic scenarios was up to 66.7 %, mainly reflected in the dynamic energy consumption during the operation phase, indicating the inaccuracy of traditional static LCA. Therefore, a D-LCA by integrating BIM and BEMP can facilitate dynamic modeling and improve the accuracy and reliability of LCA for buildings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {High-rise buildings represent technological, urban, and life-style trends of the modern urban landscape, yet there are limited data regarding their embodied carbon and environmental impacts, particularly when compared to low- or mid-rise buildings. Given that the projected growth of the global urban population by 2050 requires cities with higher density and potentially a greater number of high-rise buildings, it is crucial to develop a clear understanding of the embodied carbon and environmental impacts of high-rise buildings. The primary structural materials used in high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and structural steel. As of today, over 99% of tall buildings’ structures are built from those two materials. This article utilizes a building information modeling (BIM)-based life cycle assessment (LCA) in Revit and Tally to examine the embodied carbon and environmental impacts of an actual high-rise building structure case study in Chicago that uses a hybrid concrete steel structure. The results show that the embodied carbon and environmental impacts of the high-rise building structure are dominated by the impacts of the product stage in the building’s life cycle and by concrete being the main structural material. Specifically, this study reveals that concrete constitutes a substantial 91% share of the total mass of the building structure, with a 74% contribution to the life cycle global warming potential, 53% to the acidification potential, 74% to the eutrophication potential, 74% to the smog formation potential, and 68% to the non-renewable energy usage. On the other hand, steel accounts for 9% of the building’s structure mass, estimated to constitute 26% of the global warming potential, 47% of the acidification potential, 26% of the eutrophication potential, 26% of the smog formation potential, and 32% of the non-renewable energy usage. © 2024 by the authors.},

Low-carbon, green, and sustainable bridge engineering has emerged as an inevitable trend. A comprehensive carbon emission calculation system is key to achieving low-carbon bridges. This study proposes a rapid calculation and analysis system for bridge carbon emissions (Building Information Modeling–Life Cycle Assessment, BIM-LCA). This system, using the bridge information model as a carrier, calculates and manages data on material consumption, machinery, transportation, and energy throughout the bridge’s life cycle. It then calculates the carbon emissions for each stage. This system simplifies the complex and cumbersome data collection and analysis processes found in traditional methods while also making the carbon emissions across the full bridge life cycle more accessible and visible. Being applicable to all types of bridges, this system can provide insights and a basis for decision-making in the early design stages and during construction and operation to support carbon reduction. Ultimately, it promotes low-carbon, environmentally friendly, and sustainable bridge engineering development. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as central to construction design, planning, execution and maintenance, integration into the entire infrastructure sustainability process is imperative for achieving sustainable development. Despite its immense benefit of aiding compliance to sustainable construction, potential barriers continue to widen the gap in implementation. Therefore, this study adopts the “interpretive structural modelling approach” to advance a ranked structure of the interrelatedness of the barriers to integrating BIM in buildings sustainability assessment. The “Matrice d’Impacts croises-multipication applique a classement analysis (MICMAC)” was utilised to categorise the identified adoption barriers in the model. The identified barriers and relationship with themselves are valuable in discussing the challenges to BIM-based LCA and developing policies and design decisions to drive the process further. Further, it adds to the emerging discussion of BIM from the life cycle sustainability assessment perspective for infrastructure.

	abstract = {A fundamental issue in the development and engineering industries is the efficient management of complex structures during their entire lifecycles. Traditional fragmented techniques have been used, and this has led to instances of poor communication and subpar performance, particularly in the context of repair and restoration initiatives. Building information modeling (BIM) emerged as a ground-breaking strategy that offers a digital representation of a building's attributes and facilitates effective collaboration among several stakeholders. The current study examines how BIM impacts complex building management throughout the course of a structure's existence. It focuses on how BIM helps to advance maintenance procedures, environmental initiatives, and project effectiveness. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), structural equation modeling (SEM), and literature research are the three phases of the study's methodology. A thorough investigation was carried out in Pakistan's Rawalpindi and Islamabad region utilizing a quantitative technique. The poll of 159 participants produced intriguing findings. The process of EFA serves to verify constructs and questions, ensuring their reliability and validity. On the other hand, SEM is used to assess the structural relationships between variables and their impact on BIM based lifecycle management. The findings suggest that the application of BIM is favorably influenced by each phase of a project, namely Design, Construction, Operation and Maintenance, Renovation and Retrofitting, and End-of-Life Decisions. This highlights the need to implement a complete BIM strategy across all stages of a project's lifespan, which may enhance facility management, decrease expenses, and promote sustainability. The results of this study have significant consequences for professionals and politicians, highlighting the crucial need to provide incentives and regulations to promote the use of BIM in building projects. © 2024},

	abstract = {Architecture is one of the important factors that cause environmental pollution. This study aims to strengthen the application of green design concept in architecture, promote the sustainable development of architecture, and realize the rational utilization of public resources. First, according to the life cycle and sustainable development theories, building sustainability is divided into three levels: economy, environment, and society. Second, based on the building information modeling (BIM) technology, the economic evaluation model, environmental evaluation model, and social evaluation model of sustainable building life cycle are established. Moreover, the life cycle cost, environmental impact evaluation, and social impact evaluation of buildings at different stages are analyzed to realize the comprehensive evaluation of building sustainability and promote the green development of architectural design. The results denote that the pre-project cost accounts for the lowest proportion in the sustainable life cycle of buildings without discount. The operation and maintenance cost is the highest, accounting for 65.4%. Regarding net present value, the project cost is mainly installation, outdoor, etc., with 61.5%, while the proportion of operation and maintenance expenses and demolition expenses decreases. According to the social assessment of the sustainable building life cycle, workers' welfare greatly impacts society, among which fair salary, health, and social welfare have an impact degree of 0.15, 0.175, and 1.714, respectively. Economically, after considering the discount rate, operation and maintenance can save costs more effectively. At the environmental level, there are differences in the evaluation of environmental impact at different stages of the building life cycle. The social welfare at the worker level has the most significant impact on society, which extends to all stages of the building life cycle, and the impact at the worker level is higher than the social value level, which is consistent with the actual situation, and verifies the quantifiable ability of the model to the social sustainability of buildings. In this study, life cycle cost analysis and BIM technology are integrated to realize the evaluation of building sustainability in economic, environmental, and social aspects, thus enhancing the development of sustainability in the field of architecture and making some contributions to promoting the rational utilization of public resources. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of life cycle assessment (LCA) in inspecting environmental impacts, its execution through manual methods affects the quality of the results, besides consuming the time and effort of decision-makers in the construction industry, such as designers, implementers, facility managers, and consultants. When LCA relies on building information modeling (BIM), it encounters many difficulties and obstacles, such as human intervention, conflicts among platforms and environmental databases, and no coordination to integrate or manage information. Thus, the research aims to support LCA through automatized integration with BIM depending on BIM's role in information management, promoting decisions, and activating BIM implementation success factors to make the BIM model qualified for the LCA. Then, the BIM and LCA overlap methods were analyzed and exemplified. Also, the requirements of their integration strategies were identified for LCA to become automated from now. Accordingly, the process map that supports and coordinates the automatized integration of LCA and BIM, overcomes integration difficulties, and conducts LCA through automated methods was deduced and structured. The analytical hierarchy process was applied through the survey using questionnaires and interviews to validate this map. The survey affirmed that the BIM model acquired new characteristics and will play an essential role in the LCA's accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness. This map supports the standardization and alternative strategies of the workflow. Furthermore, the interconnected stages of this map as a scenario can conduct an LCA within any project's life stage and guarantee its quality. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Facility management (FM) plays an important role in the attainment of a sustainable built environment during the building operational stage since it is responsible for decisions that influence materials’ durability, waste, cost reduction and energy efficiency. However, the integration of the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach in FM presents some difficulties in obtaining complete inventories for building components, tracking material flows and defining system boundaries. This paper aims to establish the environmental impact comparison between maintenance actions and replacement interventions performed during the life cycle of a steel frame from a building facade. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, the effects of different repair/maintenance actions and end-of-life scenarios were analysed using two tools: an LCA building information modelling-based tool and an LCA open-source tool. Findings: The results showed that repairing and maintaining the steel structure is essential for the safety and preservation of the steel structure. However, steel maintenance and repair practices that involve fewer environmental impacts need to be explored. Social implications: It also emphasises the crucial role of facility managers in promoting sustainability and supporting informed decision-making throughout the building’s life cycle, thereby aiding in the pursuit of sustainable development and the goal of decarbonisation by 2050. Originality/value: This study reveals that maintenance processes in building management have a greater environmental impact compared to material replacement activities, especially concerning the steel structure within the case study building, as assessed using two LCA software tools. The findings provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of maintenance and replacement phases and underscore the need for further investigation into more sustainable maintenance practices within facility management. Additionally, the study raises public awareness and engagement in environmental responsibility, contributing positively to the achievement of a sustainable built environment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In this paper, developing an online tool for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of unconventional construction materials in collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs) is proposed. The LCA provides information on the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to disposal or recycling. The LLMs are neural network architectures, typically utilizing variants of recurrent neural networks such as the transformer, which are trained on large bodies of textual data using techniques such as pre-training and fine-tuning. This study focuses on the use of bacterial cellulose composites as a biobased unconventional construction material. The methodology of developing an LLM-aided LCA tool is divided into five stages: Defining the functional unit; identifying the life cycle stages; collecting environmental and social impact data; interpreting and evaluating; developing a web-based tool. The results of this study have shown that the designers can incorporate sustainable thinking in the design process by using LLMs integrated to LCA, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future against the impacts of the Anthropocene. Overall, the outcomes demonstrated the value of human-computer interaction (HCI) as a tool for exploring new possibilities with biobased materials and for inspiring designers to reconsider the material evaluation in their work. Future studies can delve into the integration of this tool into building information modeling software or computational design software in order to perform LCA for 3D structures. Different scales of such applications in design practices, such as fashion design, product design or service design can also be conducted by questioning how LCA can be combined with LLMs to leverage novel sustainable design solutions. © 2023, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

	abstract = {Prefabricated concrete building (PCB) can save resources, reduce construction, improve quality, and reduce pollution. Understanding PCB environmental benefits versus traditional buildings could reinforce relevant policies and adoption. This study aimed to develop a holistic life-cycle accounting system based on BIM technology to calculate carbon emissions of PCB accurately and efficiently, and verify the effects of energy saving and emission reduction. Existing international and national databanks allowed the compilation of carbon emission factors. Five representative residential PCB projects were enlisted to calculate carbon footprints in six individual life-cycle construction stages. In most stages, carbon emissions were reduced with an increasing prefabrication rate. In the operation and maintenance stage, carbon emissions accounted for approximately 91% of the total, and the building materials production stage accounted for about 11%. The “negative carbon emission” in the demolition and recycling stage was about −4%. Carbon emissions of the remaining three stages were minimal at about < 2%. This study established the whole life-cycle carbon-emission indices of residential prefabricated buildings, with average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 105.88 kgCO2/(m2.a), and computed values for individual building stages. For comparison, a completely cast-in-place building was studied, with average annual carbon emission per unit area at around 130.79 kgCO2/(m2.a), significantly higher than the PCB. The study contributed to knowledge by furnishing the holistic carbon footprint calculation method and establishing the empirical patterns and trends of carbon emissions of PCB. The findings could inform construction projects' carbon-emission control and achieve the construction industry's green and low-carbon goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Because of the limited research on the life cycle carbon emissions of Chinese hospitals, this study conducted a detailed carbon-accounting and comparative study. Firstly, BIM and LCA were used to quantify the carbon emissions of the inpatient building in each stage of the life cycle. Secondly, the differences in carbon emissions by stage were compared on the basis of 20 cases of public buildings. The results show that the whole-life carbon emissions of the inpatient building was 10,459.94 kgCO2/m2. The proportion of operational carbon emissions was 94.68%, with HVAC (52.57%), equipment (27.85%), and lighting (10.11%) being the main sources. Embodied carbon emissions accounted for 4.54%, and HRB400 steel and C30 concrete were the main sources of carbon emissions. Hospitals are second only to emporiums in terms of operational carbon intensity, being 1.71 and 1.41 times that of schools and office buildings, with inpatient buildings being 3 and 1.7 times that of medical complexes and outpatient buildings, respectively. The future sustainable development of hospital buildings should promote efficient building performance and good environmental quality, both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon reduction. © 2024 by the authors.},

Understanding trends, gaps, and opportunities in life cycle assessment (LCA) for adopting a circular economy is critical. This study investigates the development of publications, identifies the most effective documents, authors, and countries, and highlights critical issues, knowledge axes, active research areas, and knowledge gaps. The study screened 196 out of 280 articles from the Scopus database and conducted a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Document clustering analysis identified the main research domains, and thematic classifications of knowledge areas and axes were provided. Additionally, development opportunities and knowledge gaps were identified through a full-text analysis of selected articles. The results show an increase in publications post-2017, with key research clusters including “Critical consideration,” “Circular building component,” “Building material,” “Design for disassembly,” “Integrated load match analysis,” “Adaptive reuse project,” “Data bank,” “Prospective life cycle assessment,” “Investment decision,” and “Environmental comparison.” Over 60% of the documents propose circular design solutions, end-of-life strategies, and alternative materials, while more than 80% focus solely on the environmental aspect. Only 4.6% develop integrated indicators, 2.5% automate LCA, 2.1% compile life cycle inventory databases, and 2% consider the social dimension. The findings emphasize the need to develop integrated indicators, methods, life cycle inventory databases, and automation tools based on integrated platforms and emerging technologies like building information modeling.

	abstract = {The construction sector is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions and a major consumer of non-renewable resources. Architectural design decisions play a critical role in a building’s carbon footprint, making it essential to incorporate environmental analyses at various design stages. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and building information modeling (BIM) can support designers in achieving low-carbon architectural design. The proposed solution involves the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool. This study presents a novel approach to optimizing the environmental impact of architectural projects. It combines machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The first case studies present specific examples of tools developed for this purpose. The first case study details a machine learning-assisted tool used for estimating carbon footprints during the design phase and shows numerical carbon footprint optimization results. The second case study explores the use of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, as virtual assistants to suggest optimizations in architectural design and shows tests on the suggestions made by the LLM. The third case study discusses integrating BIM in the form of an IFC file, carbon footprint analysis, and AI into a comprehensive 3D application, emphasizing the importance of AI in enhancing decision-making processes in architectural design. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Construction management involves three primary objectives: quality, schedule, and cost. Engineering information management is a crucial factor in controlling construction project costs. As digitalization continues to develop, traditional engineering information management methods must evolve to achieve better cost control. While many researchers have proposed various methods to enhance the efficiency of information management, they often fail to consider the integration and collaboration of information throughout the building life cycle, as well as the role of stakeholders in the information management platform. To address these issues, this paper proposes a BIM-based life-cycle management platform. This paper first examines the traditional approach to acquiring and integrating building information and then suggests using BIM-based technology to improve information management throughout the building life cycle, highlighting the benefits of this technology. Next, the paper establishes a proposal on BIM-based lifecycle information management platform, identifying and collaborating on information modules for lifecycle applications of the information management platform. The paper's findings demonstrate that this paper offers a valuable reference for deepening the application of life cycle information management in construction projects. © ASCE.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is characterized by potential benefits at many phases of the construction project life cycle. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to evaluate the benefits of BIM adoption and implementation for project stakeholders in the Vietnamese construction industry context. Methods: This study aimed to identify and evaluate the benefits of BIM adoption and implementation in construction projects based on the perception of project stakeholders through data collection from 159 valid construction practitioners. The reliability and validity tests were performed to analyze collected data by SPSS 22 software. Results: The results demonstrated that four primary clusters of the project stakeholders received benefits when BIM was adopted in construction projects: architectural and structural design units (10 benefits), facility management units (8 benefits), contractors (6 benefits), and owners (6 benefits). These clusters accounted for 58.954%, 5.975%, 4.682%, and 3.736%, respectively, of the variance that characterized the benefits of BIM adoption. The findings indicated that 'improve the quality of design drawings', and 'minimize conflicts/changes' were the most significant BIM benefits for architectural and structural design units, whereas 'convenient for managing project data' and 'easy planning and resource mobilization' were the top benefits for facility management units. For contractors, 'minimize construction errors' and 'construction cost saving' were the most prominent benefits. Besides, BIM brought owners such striking benefits as 'maximize project performance' and 'easier to choose investment options'. © 2022 St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering.

	abstract = {Sustainable building-demolition-waste management has become an important practice. Normally, three different methods of disposing of demolition waste should be considered: landfill, reuse, and recycling. The use of traditional documentation techniques for assessing the environmental impact of different disposal methods during the end-of-life (EOL) stage results in hundreds of detailed instruction sheets that need to be stored. In this study, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) framework is proposed for the evaluation and comparison of the environmental impacts of the three disposal strategies mentioned above in terms of factors such as the extraction of resources, loss of biodiversity, and effect on human health by using the information obtained with typical building information modeling (BIM). In the LCA framework, four environmental-impact-allocation types (namely, no, equal, mass, and economic allocations) are used to calculate the final impacts of the products to be shared by more than one product system. The results reveal that a particular disposal strategy should be investigated by considering an entire building to assess the effective reuse/recycling potential. In addition, a BIM-based plug-in (BIM-EF) is developed for the automatic appraisal of the environmental impact of buildings at the EOL stage by using Revit Add-in Manager. Two data libraries (the engineering quantity data library and environmental impact factor library) are created, and a coding system is established to connect the information stored in the BIM model and the two data libraries. Finally, the results of a case study are presented to illustrate the potential applications of the proposed method. © 2021},

The application of BIM technology in each stage is analyzed using principal component analysis and structural equation modeling methods. It was found that introducing BIM technology can significantly improve the efficiency of the design, production, construction and later operation and maintenance of assembly buildings. Specifically, in the design stage, BIM technology enhances the design efficiency through collaborative design; in the production stage, the production process is optimized through information management; in the construction stage, the 3D visualization tool of BIM reduces the construction errors and improves the construction efficiency; and in the operation and maintenance stage, the data management function of BIM technology improves the efficiency of the operation and maintenance of the building. The results show that applying BIM technology can reduce costs by about 20% over the entire project cycle. The conclusion indicates that BIM technology plays a vital role in the whole life cycle management of assembled buildings, which not only improves the efficiency, but also significantly reduces the cost, and is of great significance in promoting the modernization of the construction industry. © 2023 Rong Ma, published by Sciendo.},

The task of automating information processing previously performed with a high proportion of so-called “paper” technologies concerns, in particular, the task of traditional filling in lists of materials for creating design and estimate documentation before passing the state expertise are the domain area of the study analysis. The most dynamic and structured domestic building information modeling system has been used as a platform to analyze its ability to solve such routine task. Currently, buildings and structures life cycle information support is largely based on the application programming interface (API) implementation in the relevant software products. The object of analysis is the software API library. The API model structure of classes has been analyzed in terms of the task. It has been found that the presence of the API library does not guarantee a software can automate routine information modeling tasks. It is shown that one of the main reasons for this is the features of the API library classes structure development which does not allow adding parameters to object type styles and making any changes to the list of building materials, therefore, creating a consolidated list of own building materials. Revised structure of classes and additional API methods are needed to automate the routine work with building materials, change and create own elements in the list of building materials at the design stage within building life cycle. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This research assumes that managing the factors of construction waste will inevitably reduce its quantity during the CLC using building information modeling (BIM) and lean design. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of two techniques (Designing Out Waste and Design Strategies) based on qualitative factors using the BIM/Lean design concepts in the design phase which could reduce construction waste in the CLC of industrial projects. To achieve this aim, the research presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors of construction waste using system dynamics. A model was proposed that serves as a decision-support tool to ensure construction waste reduction in the CLC. The model in this study includes eight causal loop diagrams giving the professionals better understanding for the objectives to reduce construction waste. This model has been processed using AnyLogic software with a stock-flow diagram to create the system dynamics model. Finally, the validation and implementation are demonstrated using a case study for the suggested model. The case study's findings improved the model's confidence in order to utilize it for quantitative analysis. It has been further assessed for its impact in two proposed scenarios to reduce construction waste.

This study emphasizes the importance of early design phases, offering a semi-automated model to estimate life cycle costs from design to disposal. The model enables comprehensive economic assessments, highlighting the long-term feasibility of design decisions by considering life cycle costs early in the process. Investing in accessible and universal design features upfront can lead to long-term savings by reducing the need for extensive future retrofits. The model allows for comparisons among different design alternatives, assessing the financial impact of features such as wider doorways, accessible bathrooms, and elevators.

This study explores the potential for energy savings in residential buildings in Cyprus through optimising building envelopes and insulation materials. Using building information modelling and energy modelling software, the study analyses 120 combinations of building envelopes and eight insulation materials, identifying an optimal combination of wall, roof, and flooring materials that could result in 32% energy load reductions and 27% lower life-cycle costs compared to the median scenario. High-density rock wool insulation on roofs and double-glazed windows were also found to offer both monetary and energy performance benefits. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the current high energy prices could provide greater economic incentives to adopt these optimisation strategies. Optimising building materials in Cyprus could play a critical role in climate strategy while also offering significant economic benefits. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Considering the world population, an additional 415.1 billion m2 of built floor will be needed by 2050, which could worsen the environmental impact of the construction industry that is responsible for one-third of global Carbon Emissions (CEs). Thus, the current construction practices need to be upgraded toward eco-friendly technologies. Building Information Modeling (BIM) proved a significant potential to enhance Building and Infrastructure (B&I) ecological performances. However, no previous study has evaluated the nexus between BIM and B&I CEs. This study aims to fill this gap by disclosing the research evolution and metrics and key concepts and tools associated with this nexus. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method design was adopted based on scientometric and scoping reviews of 52 consistent peer-reviewed papers collected from 3 large scientific databases. Findings: This study presented six research metrics and revealed that the nexus between BIM and CEs is a contemporary topic that involves seven main research themes. Moreover, it cast light on six key associated concepts: Life Cycle Assessment; Boundary limits; Building Life Cycle CE (BLCCE); Responsible sources for BLCCE; Green and integrated BIM; and sustainable buildings and related rating systems. Furthermore, it identified 56 nexus-related Information and Communication Technologies tools and 17 CE-coefficient databases and discussed their consistency. Originality/value: This study will fill the knowledge gap by providing scholars, practitioners and decision-makers with a good grasp of the nexus between CEs and BIM and paving the path toward further research, strategies and technological solutions to decrease CEs of B&I sectors and their impacts on the climate change. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Transforming the construction sector is key to reaching net-zero, and many stakeholders expect its decarbonization through digitalization, but no quantified evidence has been brought to date. This article proposes the first environmental quantification of the impact of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction sector. Specifically, the direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road maintenance – a Pavement Management System (PMS) - are evaluated using field data from France. The related carbon footprints are calculated following a life cycle approach, using different sources of data – including ecoinvent v3.6 – and the IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three design-build-maintain pavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1 relates to a massive design and surface maintenance, scenario 2 to a progressive design and pre-planned structural maintenance, and scenario 3 to a progressive design and tailored structural maintenance supported by the PMS. First, results show the negligible direct emissions due to the PMS existence – 0.02% of the life cycle emissions of scenario 3's pavement, e.g. 0.52 t CO2eq for 10 km and 30 years. Second, the base case and two complementary sensitivity analyses show that the use of a PMS is climate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade bearing capacity improves over time, neutral for the climate otherwise. The GHG emissions savings using BIM can reach up to 14 and 30% of the life cycle emissions respectively compared to scenario 2 and 1, and resp. 47 and 65% when restraining the scope to maintenance and rehabilitation and excluding original pavement construction. Third, the neutral effect of BIM in case of a deterioration of the bearing capacity of the subgrade may be explained by design practices and safety margins, that could in fact be enhanced using BIM. Fourth, the decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is discussed, and research perspectives are presented. © 2023 The Authors},

The analysis encompasses several aspects like annual research output and knowledge flows, in the aim of unveiling disparities in the technological requirements, defining research boundaries, and illuminating lifecycle research trends. Findings indicate an ongoing surge in research across all BIM lifecycle stages with technologies like digital twins and artificial intelligence becoming prevailing trends. The cooperative design of BIM components, virtual-real world coordination, interactions among buildings, individuals, and environments, as well as the in-depth integration of BIM with the multifaceted fields of urban management have emerged as focal points in the planning, construction, management, and maintenance of BIM, respectively.

	abstract = {In order to establish a sustainable bridge assessment within a practical planning routine, it is necessary to reduce the calculation effort by applying automated algorithms. Information generated by the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be used as project-specific input data for this purpose. For the method of life cycle assessment (LCA), the approach of linking the materials of the BIM-model with environmental data sets to calculate the ecological impacts has become widely established. This material-based approach provides sufficiently accurate results for an ecologic assessment in late planning phases. For early planning phases it is not directly applicable and the approach is not transferable to the application of the calculation methods life cycle costing and macroeconomic cost calculation. The approach presented in this paper introduces a framework that can be used to calculate the life cycle impacts of a bridge by linking the objects of a BIM-model with the content of a hierarchically structured catalogue of elements. To establish this catalogue, individual items are pre-balanced and combined to generate base elements. To represent the entire life cycle of a bridge, follow-up elements, which occur after a specific time interval within the use and dismantling phase, are additionally defined. The individual base elements are combined into generalized major and macro elements into which the individual base elements are included with statistical shares. By applying the different element types, it is possible to use BIM-bridge models with different levels of detail for a holistic assessment and to include all impacts that occur during the complete life cycle. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Whole building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) is a key methodology to reduce the environmental impacts in the building sector. Research studies usually face challenges in presenting comprehensive LCA results due to the complexity of assessments at the building level. There is a dearth of methods for the systematic evaluation and optimization of the WBLCA performance at the design stage. The study aims to develop a design optimization framework based on the proposed WBLCA method to evaluate and improve the environmental performance at the building level. Design/methodology/approach: The WBLCA development method is proposed with detailed processes based on the EN 15978 standard. The environmental product declaration (EPD) methods were adopted to ensure the WBLCA is comprehensive and reliable. Building information modeling (BIM) was used to ensure the building materials and assembly contributions are accurate and provide dynamic material updates for the design optimization framework. Furthermore, the interactive BIM-LCA calculation processes were demonstrated for measuring the environmental impacts of design upgrades. The TOPSIS-based LCA results normalization was selected to conduct the comparisons of various building design upgrades. Findings: The case study conducted for a residential building showed that the material embodied impacts and the operational energy use impacts are the two critical factors that contribute 60–90% of the total environmental impacts and resource uses. Concrete and wood are the main material types accounting for an average of 65% of the material embodied impacts. The air and water heating for the house are the main energy factors, as these account for over 80% of the operational energy use. Based on the original WBLCA results, two scenarios were established to improve building performance through the design optimization framework. Originality/value: The LCA results show that the two upgraded building designs create an average of 5% reduction compared with the original building design and improving the thermal performance of the house with more insulation materials does not always reduce the WBLCA results. The proposed WBLCA method can be used to compare the building-level environmental performances with the similar building types. The proposed framework can be used to support building designers to effectively improve the WBLCA performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To get a Digital Twin with innovative methods and less effort, the Scan to Twin principle is introduced, by creating-out of point clouds-a smart Building Information Modeling (BIM) model and Digital Twin with connections to other databases, as a real Virtual Reality (VR) substation simulation model. This paper describes the process of how to get the models, step by step, with a real use-case of an existing substation project of a transmission operator. The paper introduces a newly developed VR client solution connected to a BIM engineering solution to create-in a few clicks-VR models of existing substation BIM models.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The implementation of Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) in the planning process seems to be a challenge for most planners and is often not integrated into the planning process due to lack of time, interest or knowledge. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) method offers a promising basis for exchanging data more efficiently with LCA tools. Analyzing the current state of automation of this work process, the authors present a study about the preparation of a LCA with the open-source tool “eLCA” of the German federal institute for research on Building (BBSR) in terms of time efficiency and accuracy of two different workflows. The two workflows are the “Quantity take-off” method and the BIM based method “IFC import”. A total of 66 participants from two different universities (Germany and Austria) attended the study. To measure the time efficiency of the specific workflow, participants are guided through a designed process using the process management tool “Camunda”. The results of the study show that the method of “IFC import” allows on average a faster preparation of the LCA, but deviates more in the accuracy of the results. Moreover, this paper highlights the difficulties in preparing an LCA for first-time users. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This study endeavors to combine Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to enhance the environmental efficiency of buildings. The core objective is the optimization of materials used in the building’s outer shell to effectively curtail operational energy consumption. To achieve this, we employed BIM modeling, parametric simulations with the Energy Plus engine, and Athena to assess the embodied energy in materials. The multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGAII was harnessed to determine the most suitable materials. The results derived from the LCA and BIM analyses illustrate that the selection of optimal materials for residential building facades in Iran can lead to a remarkable 40% reduction in annual average energy consumption. Furthermore, this approach contributes significantly to mitigating global warming potential (GWP).

Despite its ascending prominence, the domain grapples with ambiguities in application pathways, uncertain developmental trajectories, and the absence of a holistic technical paradigm. This research endeavors to bridge these gaps by conducting a thorough and multidimensional investigation into the current landscape of prefabricated MEP installation initiatives. This study meticulously dissects the paradigm from five critical vantage points: historical evolution, standards and regulations, life cycle analysis, technological applications, and corporate implementation strategies. At present, there is still a lack of standards and specifications specifically for the field of assembled MEP installation. The analysis reveals a trend towards intelligent and sustainable installation practices in prefabricated MEP projects. The research predominantly focuses on the design, production, and installation stages. Notably, building information modeling (BIM) emerges as the most prominent technology, followed by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 3D laser scanning, with extended reality (XR) technologies gaining traction. Large, state-owned construction firms are spearheading innovative applications in this realm. In summary, this paper provides an overview and outlook for the development direction and the application of cutting-edge technologies in prefabricated MEP installation projects, with the aim of supporting the industry’s advancement. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Energy demand reduction targets and sustainable design paradigms are fueling the search for more and more effective design solutions in the building sector, and new technologies and construction systems are being presented. However, each design solution has its own consequences for the environmental impact of the building. The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be profitably adopted for supporting the decision-making process. This paper reports a comparative methodology developed to analyse the impacts of alternative structural solutions for timber-based high-rise structures. Embodied, operational, and end-of-life environmental impacts based on two structural frame types, a reinforced concrete (RC) structure and cross-laminated timber (CLT) are explored. Two main inputs are used for performing a comprehensive cradle-to-grave LCA for the whole building: the bill of quantities from a Revit BIM model and the energy demand from DesignStudio. Then, an LCA is performed using the One Click LCA tool for a service life of 50 years and 12 impact categories. The environmental impacts of building materials are based on Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) directly embedded in the tool. The method is then applied to a case study in Aalborg, Denmark. Results indicate that the total emissions for the considered case study are 9.6 kg- CO2 eq./m2/y for the CLT structure against 10.8 kg- CO2 eq./m2/y for the RC structure. The production stage of building materials, including building systems and installations, accounts for around 55% of the total emissions, while energy use (B6 phase) during the in-use stage of the building recorded a lower environmental impact (45%). The outcomes confirm the opportunity to base the discussion on alternative design options on more objective and data-based elements to support the different positions which already involve a wide range of architectural, functional and financial criteria. This is of great relevance in achieving balanced and informed decisions which do not simply follow green-labelled ideas but are grounded on evidence-based considerations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: The built environment is taking enormous leaps towards its digitalization. Computer-aided tools such as building information modeling (BIM) are found in the forefront of this evolution, playing a critical role in creating the foundations for the upcoming development of smart low-carbon cities. However, the potential of BIM is still untapped – links will need to be created among the available and forthcoming methodologies under one integral operational system. The purpose of this paper is to present an integrated BIM-based life cycle-oriented framework for achieving sustainable constructions at the pre-construction phase. The developed framework represents an example of the approaches that the construction industry will need to adopt to integrate the different tools under an integrated smart city context. Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach follows the development of four same-volume different-configuration three-dimensional BIM designs, which are coupled with life cycle assessment (LCA) tools for establishing sustainable building design. Findings: The results of this paper indicated that the choice of building design and shape can play a significant role in reducing the embodied energy and embodied carbon of buildings, achieving a reduction of up to 15% compared to a reference building of same volume and gross floor area. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is found in its approach application by coupling three-dimensional BIM models with LCA data, the use of reinforcement detailing in an nD BIM study and the employment of country-specific LCA databases. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction, which generates approximately 33% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and contributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present, interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact. Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75% of carbon emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement routes were located according to the types of transport used and the location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level. The impact of the building in the production, construction, de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use of the three tools - LCA, BIM and GIS - allowed us to establish that the highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix, which contribute to the sustainable development of the city. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {It is well known that a large part of the existing European building stock needs to be renovated to increase structural and energy performance. Unfortunately, deep renovations come with high initial costs, and therefore, owners and real estate developers often prefer complete demolition and reconstruction. Both options depend on specific factors, and to select which option could be the closest to the optimal scenario, it is necessary to evaluate all environmental, social, and economic indicators. Life Cycle Analysis is of great significance to evaluate building sustainability, in particular through the comparison between different design alternatives. However, the life cycle impacts of the construction stage depend on selected materials and technologies that can be subject to change during the subsequent stages of the design process, i.e., moving from preliminary design to detailed design and execution plans. With the aim of understanding the role of LCA during the design process, the case study of “ProGETonE—Proactive Synergy of Integrated Efficient Technologies on Buildings’ Envelopes” has been addressed, leading to the observation that the impacts, in particular the global warming potential (GWP), raised significantly.

	abstract = {A retrofit plan for improving the energy efficiency of an existing building can contribute to a sustainable built environment. This study presents a novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, 6D-Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance existing buildings' energy efficiency through applying energy retrofit measures. This framework aims to (1) integrate life cycle cost, and environmental impacts analysis (2) identify energy-efficient alternatives for buildings' energy retrofit (3) make the decision-making process straightforward for decision-makers and investors (4) discover the primary energy efficiency agents that impose the most energy waste on existing buildings. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by applying effective retrofit measures and alternative material choice and empowers decision-making by analyzing life cycle cost and environmental impacts of building envelopes by combining mathematical optimization, BIM, and LCA. The BIM energy model compares the cooling and heating loads of the building's components before and after applying retrofitting measures. The results show that inefficient buildings' envelopes and evaporative coolers play a significant role in energy consumption. A developed mathematical optimization model estimates the economic benefits of energy efficiency upgrades to minimize the total lifecycle cost of a building during its lifetime. Moreover, it provides an optimum energy retrofitting scenario that leads to reductions of 24%–58.2% in energy consumption. In conclusion, the Life Cycle Assessment Comparison between the building before and after retrofitted measures demonstrates that over 45% of global warming impacts could be reduced in the well-established building. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the context of the digital and sustainable transformation of building projects, the integrated approach of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely studied. Recent advancements in such integrated modeling processes and techniques have not yet provided reliable and robust decision-making capabilities for designers to intuitively choose between material alternatives. This study develops a new design framework that integrates BIM, LCA, and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) algorithms to facilitate sustainable design processes in building projects. A case study using a single-family housing project in the British Columbia province of Canada was implemented to test the designs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated framework, including a three-way comparison of design scenarios—conventional hot-roll steel, recycled steel, and timber. The results indicate a significant performance improvement with the adoption of recycled structural steel materials, surpassing conventional steel designs and demonstrating a similar performance to that of timber designs. The study underscores the importance of informed decision-making in material selection, driven by the quantitative analysis of digital designs and multi-criteria evaluation (e.g., social carbon cost). This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for designers, engineers, and builders to achieve sustainability when designing building projects through the systematic and rapid comparison of environmental performance. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The world is progressing towards sustainable, eco-friendly, recyclable materials to enhance the circular economy and mitigate the issues of carbon footprint, overburdened landfills, and waste of natural resources. As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major contributor towards climate change and given that the construction industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the context of developing countries. This research presents a novel framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize construction’s design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses. Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the results show that 29.35% of the materialization stage, 16.04% of the operational stage, and 21.14% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective environmental impacts. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The construction industry plays a crucial role in achieving global carbon neutrality. The purpose of this study is to explore the application of photovoltaic curtain walls in building models and analyze their impact on carbon emissions in order to find the best adaptation method that combines economy and carbon reduction. Through a carbon emissions calculation and economic analysis of replacing photovoltaic curtain walls on a large public building in Zhenjiang, China, the results showed that after replacing glass curtain walls with photovoltaic curtain walls, the carbon emissions during the construction operation stage decreased by 30.74%, but the carbon emissions during the production and transportation stage of building materials increased by 10.48%. The carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of the building have been reduced by 20.99%. This indicates that photovoltaic curtain wall technology has the potential to reduce building carbon emissions. Further promoting the development of production technology and sales routes for photovoltaic curtain walls and accelerating the improvement of carbon trading systems can further improve the carbon emission reduction effect of buildings.

	abstract = {Water consumption in buildings is a significant contributor to global freshwater utilization, yet research on the consequences of water usage has been limited. This study aims to evaluate the environmental implications of life-cycle water consumption in a multi-family residential building located in Doha, Qatar, using a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA). The analysis of the building was conducted using Building Information Modelling (BIM) as the primary tool. The LCA results revealed substantial impacts during the raw water treatment phase in Doha, which is characterized by energy-intensive thermal desalination. The water usage phase accounted for nearly half of the total impact observed. Throughout the life cycle of the modeled building, the cumulative annual emission reached 59,440 kg of CO2. This research provides valuable insights for water authorities and the building research community, facilitating the development of more sustainable water usage policies tailored to specific regions or countries. By understanding the environmental ramifications of water consumption in buildings, policymakers can make informed decisions to reduce the ecological footprint associated with water usage. Overall, this study underscores the importance of considering the life-cycle perspective in assessing the environmental impact of water consumption in buildings. It emphasizes the need for sustainable water management practices and encourages the adoption of efficient technologies and policies to mitigate the environmental consequences of water usage in residential structures. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) database, and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) guideline inform embodied carbon calculations. Results show the green roof system releases 263,839.56 kgCO2e as embodied carbon, while its sedum layer sequesters 211,468.12 kgCO2e over a 50-year lifespan. Energy efficiency analysis indicates a 3.3 kWh/m2/yr reduction in energy consumption, leading to a 112,130.31 kgCO2e reduction in operational carbon emissions, highlighting the environmental benefits of green roof adoption. The findings suggest a 0.35% mitigation of whole life cycle carbon emissions, with greater impact in situations of lower insulation effectiveness, showcasing the potential of green roofs in reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, the green roof incurs a minimal financial burden, constituting only 0.51% of the overall project cost. © 2024 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Increasing efforts have been devoted to promoting sustainable demolition waste management (DWM) from a life cycle-thinking perspective. To this end, facilitating sustainability-oriented decision-making for DWM planning requires a sustainability assessment framework for assessing multifaceted criteria. This study develops a building information modelling (BIM)-based DWM sustainability assessment approach to facilitate the life cycle assessment (LCA) and decision-making by coupling the enriched Industry Foundation Classes model with hybrid multi-criteria decision-aiding (MCDA) methods using Dynamo visual scripting. To streamline the data-intensive LCA process, this study enriched the BIM properties and accommodated them into the LCA data template to enhance data interoperability, thus achieving seamless data transfer. Moreover, hybrid MCDA methods are integrated into the decision-making workflow for DWM scenario ranking. A pilot study is employed to verify the applicability of the decision-aiding framework. The results unveil that the sustainability score ascended with the recycling rate. The optimal DWM alternative with the highest recycling rate yields the highest sustainability score at 91.63. Conversely, a DWM alternative reflecting the ‘status quo’ in China’s recycling industry has the lowest score at 8.37, significantly lower than the baseline scenario with a 50% recycling rate. It is worth noting that the ‘growth curve’ of the sustainability score continuously flattens as the target recycling rate escalates. The increment in recycling rate from the ‘Australian standard’ scenario to the optimal scenario is 18.4%, whereas the sustainability score merely increases by 2.3%, signalling that the former scenario arrived at an optimum point for maximising the cost-efficiency of DWM under the predefined framework and contexts. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The construction industry is well known for generating a large amount of carbon emissions and this, together with huge costs of buildings during their life cycle, seriously affects its environmental and economic sustainability. That reducing the former tends to increase the latter is a highly significant problem exacerbating the situation. Finding a solution with the lowest carbon emission at a certain cost is an urgent problem to be solved. Research to date aimed at remedying the situation, however, has been largely focused on either treating the two issues independently or partially conjoined, with little progress in their integrated assessment. In response, this study presents a method for integrating the life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) and life cycle costs (LCC) of buildings to assess their life cycle carbon emission intensity (CEI) based on BIM technology. Through a public building in China as a case study, the feasibility of the method is verified, the key stages of building carbon emissions are analyzed using CEI, and the conversion of high carbon emission materials to low carbon emission materials is explored. The proposed methodology and framework provide solutions and ideas for achieving optimal costs commensurate with low carbon emissions throughout the building life cycle, facilitating the assessment of carbon emissions at the decision-making and design stages, achieving the optimization of building carbon emissions and costs, and enhancing building life cycle sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The role, the economic relevance and the impacts of the construction sector in the world demand, in today’s society, increasing requirements in terms of sustainability and efficiency. According to ISO 15686, the LCC (Life Cycle Cost) methodology is a useful technique that allows the evaluation of comparative costs during a specific period of time, taking into account all relevant economic factors, both in terms of initial capital costs and future operating costs. However, the integration of this powerful methodology into building design tools is still poor, limiting the ability of projects to optimize the costs of buildings during their life cycle. The emergence of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) technology in the field of architecture, engineering and construction, helped the exchange of information at the design, construction, operation and maintenance stage of a project to be shared independently of the design tools that currently exist, based on a BIM (Building Information Modeling) model that can contain relevant data related to the project/built asset [25]. According to buildingSMART, IFC are the industry’s core classes (IfcDoor, IfcWindow, IfcBeam, etc.) that form the basis for globally recognized data exchange and interoperability. Therefore, this document presents a structured proposal for LCC to implement at IFC. The proposed structure has been developed based on the ISO 15686 standard, which contains the main costs according to the construction phases. With this proposal, it is expected to encourage the implementation of LCC during the design phase of the project in BIM, to achieve more economically efficient buildings. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Prediction of construction cost and life-cycle cost through preliminary estimate is very important for the economic decision-making in the early phase of building projects. However, the conventional preliminary estimate has a high error range and low reliability because it relies only on the basic information of projects. In addition, the consideration of the life-cycle cost of the building is insufficient, causing problems such as budget shortage, inaccurate budgeting, and life-cycle cost increase. In this study, we propose a method of preliminary estimate based on BIM below the level of detail 2 and actual construction cost data to support the decision-making in the early design phase. To verify the proposed method, a web-based prototype was implemented and applied to three test cases. The range of error rate for three test cases was 1.93–7.16% (average error rate: 5.18%). It satisfies the criteria (−30% ~ +50%) of the “American Association of Cost Engineering”. As a result, the feasibility of the proposed model was validated. It is expected to be utilized as useful information in the decision-making occurring in the early design phase, and this allows for a rapid economic review of the design alternatives, a reduced LCC, and a shortened decision-making time. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information, interoperability, transparency and “big data” management are the main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management of the data generated are not safe or reliable. Design/methodology/approach: The approach outlined in this paper addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present. Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment, will support information traceability from the strategic definition to end of life. Findings: The framework of this study presents an excellent opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to stakeholders and users. Practical implications: This study provides an exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these technologies and their workflows. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Several studies have been trying to address this issue by the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Parametric tools, which enable them to face specific issues arising on projects. Amongst the different research efforts, one can perceive a gap in the field. This gap lies in the insufficient understanding of the methodological approaches and tools best suited to carry out environmental analysis. The novelty of the paper is to compare the paradigms and scope of most common used BIM and Parametric approach for LCA.

	abstract = {The growing role of sustainability in the construction industry must be considered in the entire lifecycle of a building. This way BIM (Building Information Modeling) figures as an important factor in the management of this lifecycle, from design and construction, through the operation and maintenance until the demolition. An efficient interoperability along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management and help users to improve sustainability of projects. This interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines, avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore, improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic literature review was performed considering sustainability factors, interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied. Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability in the entire lifecycle of sustainable buildings. Also, results showed the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review can be used as a tool to organize knowledge and data and systematize processes and even to structure interoperability frameworks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Construction professionals and researchers are increasingly looking for sustainable solutions for buildings in a bid to reduce some of the negative impacts associated with the sector. A common misconception is to consider sustainability as only concerning environmental issues, without regard for the interaction between a triple bottom line framework that is comprised of social, economic, and environmental factors. Material choice is known to impact building sustainability directly since the use of certain materials can dramatically alter the footprint generated over the life cycle of the building. However, the construction industry is not yet equipped with approaches that simultaneously account for all three aspects of sustainability when it comes to deciding on materials to adopt. This paper proposes a decision-making framework for construction professionals and researchers involving the integration of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to choose suitable materials for buildings. The framework is built based on a literature review of relevant papers to identify critical factors and challenges to implementing this integration. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process was chosen as the MCDA method within the proposed framework, given that the problem of material choice often contains subjectivity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which is best solved with fuzzy logic. A residential building was adopted as a case study to validate the proposed framework, and the LCSA method is applied, covering the construction, operation, and end-of-life phases of the building. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

For the progression of the transport system, it is necessary to regularly increase the number of objects, which in turn forms an increase in the volume of transport construction. The current design and construction approaches do not provide a sufficient level of fast and high-quality construction of facilities, therefore, the introduction of modern work methods is an urgent issue. Information modeling technologies are currently one of the promising areas of digitalization, but in the field of transport construction they have not yet received sufficient application. The purpose of this research work is to analyze the use of information modeling technologies for transport infrastructure objects at all stages of the life cycle, and the task is to determine the processes for implementation through the information modeling functionality. The paper outlines the main features of transport infrastructure facilities, the specifics of work based on information modeling, and also analyzes their integration throughout the entire life cycle. As a result, an analysis of the effectiveness of the use of information modeling technology tools for the main tasks of each stage of the life cycle is presented, and an information transfer algorithm is formed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

	abstract = {The climate debate necessitates reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. A common and standardized method of assessing this is life cycles assessment (LCA); however, time and costs are a barrier. Large efficiency potentials are associated with using data from building information models (BIM) for the LCA, but development is still at an early stage. This study investigates the industry practice and needs for BIM–LCA, and if these are met through a prototype for the Danish context, using IFC and a 3D view. Eight qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with medium and large architect, engineering, and contractor companies, covering a large part of the Danish AEC industry. The companies used a quantity take-off approach, and a few were developing plug-in approaches. Challenges included the lack of quality in the models, thus most companies supplemented model data with other data sources. Features they found valuable for BIM–LCA included visual interface, transparency of data, automation, design evaluation, and flexibility. The 3D view of the prototype met some of the needs, however, there were mixed responses on the use of IFC, due to different workflow needs in the companies. Future BIM–LCA development should include considerations on the lack of quality in models and should support different workflows. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, the literature provides evidence that the quantification and generalization of the environmental benefits of wood during the whole building life cycle can be difficult. This paper presents a quantitative method based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare, during their design stages, the environmental impacts produced by a timber-frame single-family house versus those of a concrete-masonry-based house built in Uruguay. The method, conceived as a decision-oriented tool, integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) and LCA to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of one of the most common dwelling typologies in Uruguay. The results of the cradle-to-grave assessment show that the timber-frame building produced the lowest impacts in Global Warming Potential, Human Toxicity, Acidification Potential, Ozone Depletion Potential, and Freshwater Ecotoxicity, but yielded the highest impacts in Eutrophication Potential. The findings also show that the method developed herein facilitated the comparison and contrast between the pros and cons of both design options during their design stages. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) has considerable potential for addressing sustain-ability issues in construction, but its benefits can be constrained by the failure to adopt BIM across the full project life cycle. Systematic whole-of-life BIM adoption can be supported by maturity models, but most models are limited by a lack of theoretical grounding, socio-technical dichotomies and the failure to adequately consider the full asset life cycle, often by overlooking the operations phase. This study aims to (1) develop a BIM maturity model that addresses these limitations by (2) using an in-depth analysis of an early adopter case study, thus addressing the lack of empirical research in BIM adoption experiences. A single interpretive research study was conducted to qualitatively analyse a US-based university. The data were gathered through interviews, field visits and document analysis. Actor–network theory (ANT) concepts scaffolded the analytical approach. The findings show that a complex BIM socio-technical network emerged, developed and converged during the project management stage but struggled to achieve durability as an ongoing solution to facilities management. By analysing the elements of success and failure across each stage, the researchers distilled five key lessons to achieve whole-of-life BIM maturity and proposed a life cycle BIM maturity model (LCBMM) supported by a practice guide. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The built environment is significantly responsible for the current climate crisis, thus developing more sustainable projects is becoming an urgent objective. One widely recognized method that supports achieving this objective is the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), which enables a holistic, quantitative evaluation of building sustainability, including environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The integration of this method in digital design tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) facilitates its use during the building design stages. However, data granularity is not the same in every design stage, and consequently data consistency cannot be assured. Hence, the margin of unexpected variation of the results shall be avoided and robust results from the early design stages should be obtained. During the early stage, the level of details is generally limited to the element definition, while during the detailed stages, the volume of information regarding the building increased. This paper aims to fill in the informational gaps during the early design stage and align those results with a detailed data structure developed for cost estimation during the detailed stages. Thus, based on a case study analysis, we can demonstrate the consistency of the method by determining the variation of material quantities and comparing the LCSA inventory indicators during the early and detailed stages. This method can estimate more than 60% of the LCSA inventory indicators during the early design stage and the total results during detailed design stage. © 2021 The Authors},

However, few studies have investigated or developed tools for the life-cycle management of durability performance of built structures leveraging BIM. This gap is partly due to (i) the lack of an accessible interface that connects BIM software with durability models of built structures, and (ii) no available durability models that are fundamental in nature and thus can integrate with other tools. To begin addressing this gap, this paper presents a framework that uses the Application Programming Interface (API) within BIM to integrate physics-based durability performance models, which extends the application of BIM into the post-construction phases by enabling more accurate predictions of life cycle performance.

	abstract = {Despite the significant role of the construction industry in nation's wealth and development, the construction industry usually suffers from poor performance in terms of time and cost overruns. This is due to its characteristics in terms of complexity, fragmented nature, a large number of involved parties and a wide range of professions. Quantity surveyors (QSs) profession is one of the key professions with many essential tasks over project life cycle. BIM has been claimed by various professions in the construction industry to enhance the project performance and tackle many problems within it. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of adopting BIM on QS profession and its performance in a construction project. The literature was intensively reviewed to determine the main responsibilities of QS over project life cycle when it works the main project parties (client and consultant). In this part of research, the implication of the use of BIM has been specifically dealt with the work in pre-construction stage. A set of criteria were extracted and identified based on the main responsibilities of QS profession by conducting structured interviews with clients and consultants. Many scenarios were produced, after modelling a multistorey building project utilizing Revit Architecture Software, to reflect the effectiveness of using BIM with various tasks of QSs. The model facilitates generation of different scenarios based on outcomes. The initial results revealed that adopting BIM improves the accuracy and reliability of QSs outputs at early stage of project and enhances the documentation of project performance over project life cycle. Also, the results demonstrate that project parties get benefits, from BIM adoption by their QSs, in terms of more reliable budgeting, less errors in quantities measurement, better documentation considering the limitation of adopting BIM, lack of BIM standard and the compatibility between the BIM software. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

	abstract = {The utilization of building information modeling (BIM) to support various tasks of building lifecycle management (BLM) has been reported in a range of studies. However, during its lifetime, a building is an important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings, site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Worldwide authorities are increasingly concerned about construction’s efficiency and sustainability, leading to the development of high-performance buildings. However, such facts have shifted a significant percentage of the building life cycle environmental impacts from the operation to the product and construction phases. Thus, the need to evaluate and select more sustainable materials and construction solutions arises, to also minimize impacts from these stages. To evaluate those impacts, LCA and LCC analysis are usually applied to assess the building impacts and costs, through the different life cycle stages. Despite the usefulness of LCA and LCC methods during the project phase, they are usually evaluated in the project later stages. It is too complex and time-consuming to gather and process all the required data during the project early stages. With the recent deployment of BIM, the opportunity to automate and shift LCA and LCC analysis to project early stages stands out. Facing the research gap, this study aims to develop a BIM-based decision-making tool for designers to evaluate the environmental, economic, and functional performance of different building construction solutions. To do so, 18 different simulation scenarios have been created in Autodesk Revit with different combinations of external walls, roofs, and floors. Then, a framework was developed in Dynamo to automatically characterize the building elements life cycle environmental impacts and costs, as well as to automate the LCA and LCC analysis during the project early stages. The outcomes can significantly reduce the required time, errors and efforts when performing LCA and LCC analysis, providing designers with real time decision support data and making an important contribution to the use of BIM for sustainability purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Prefabrication has gained its popularity in countries including China due to its various advantages such as quality control, waste reduction, onsite and offsite parallel coordination, and so on. It has also been recognized as a key strategy to reduce construction-induced carbon emissions. However, there is limited research to examine carbon emission reduction in prefabrication by using the advanced technological artefacts, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), emerging from the technology sphere. As a digital representation of a facility, BIM provides a cyber platform based on which many assessment and simulation works can be performed without having to construct the physical facility. This paper aims to develop a BIM-based approach to measuring carbon emission reduction during the materialization stage of a prefabricated building project. Findings from the study indicate that BIM is an efficient and effective method for measuring carbon emissions from the construction of new buildings and that prefabrication reduces carbon emissions when compared with conventional construction methods. The research contributes to the body of knowledge relating to the reduction of carbon emissions through prefabrication. This is pertinent to contractors, homebuyers and governments who are constantly seeking ways to achieve a circular economy. © 2020},

	abstract = {Design practitioners' knowledge about Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is crucial for the necessary decarbonisation of the built environment as well as the mitigation of other negative environmental impacts. Designers' attitudes towards LCA have so far been rarely analysed. In 2019, as part of the project IEA EBC Annex 72 "Assessing life cycle related environmental impacts caused by buildings", a global survey was conducted amongst design professionals within 23 countries. The aim was to investigate the level of awareness and acceptance of environmental performance assessment and LCA of buildings, the use of related information sources and tools as well as the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in connection to LCA. The results show that less than one third of designers currently provides or uses LCA services. The ones who do not are mainly constrained by the lack of client demand. To support an increased use of LCA during building design, not only it is necessary to provide related data and design/assessment tools, but also to establish standards/regulations to drive client demand. It is particularly relevant to include such requirements already in the client's brief. In future, an increased demand for building LCA results by institutional investors is expected. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An automatic combination of the information included in a digital model with other complementary indicators is required for an early stage cost-analysis. As a result, specifications for the building construction and operational aspects may be planned in advance in order to create an economically built and operated property ensuring a sustainable value of the property.

	abstract = {Connectivity is key in this new era of smart infrastructure. Smart airports utilize new connected technologies to improve end-user experience while ensuring operational feasibility in aeronautical and non-aeronautical segments. The increasing need for digitizing the design-build-operate life cycles of airports can be met by implementing building information modeling (BIM) that enables accessing, managing, utilizing, and connecting physical and operational data in a digital collaborative environment. This study investigates the current state of practice in airport BIM (ABIM) and the use of ABIM processes in digital airport operations and maintenance by connecting existing data sources and integrating smart airport systems. The study proposes a comprehensive and adaptive ABIM management framework that depicts the alignment and connectivity of ABIM processes, resources and stakeholders with airport operational requirements by identifying gaps in the industry and literature, and developing a global understanding in ABIM visions. Research data are collected through literature and industry review, online surveys, and semi-structured interviews with aviation professionals. Mixed methods including non-parametric statistical analysis and qualitative analysis are used to determine the elements of the framework. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) principles and language are used to generate the framework. For framework validation, a proof of concept (POC) is conducted by development and deployment of a web-based application. The developed ABIM framework is expected to guide major airport stakeholders in their BIM implementation processes to enhance airport operational efficiencies and in strategizing digital initiatives on a connected-BIM platform. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper searches for integration methods proposed by different authors that assess the life cycle of a building using models of building information modeling (BIM) and it also compares and discusses them. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the main research method of the present paper, aiming to collect and critically analyze multiple research studies. This paper is not only limited to studies where the whole life cycle has been assessed but also includes other papers which only integrated BIM to analyze carbon footprint, embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) or energy consumption. Findings: Taking into account the countries that have published articles about the subject, it is possible to deduce that it has been studied in all of the continents, except Africa. In comparison with other continents, Asia and Europe have developed more studies. Furthermore, 76% of the 34 selected articles were published in journals and only 24% in conferences proceedings, and the number of papers that relates life cycle assessment (LCA) methods using BIM has grown from 2013 to 2015, proving that the current theme is relevant. Several aspects of this literature review show the need to develop automated processes for LCA of buildings during the project's development phase. There is already a tendency to compare LCA results for buildings applied to BIM models, contributing to decision-making related to alternate projects, selection of materials, suppliers and components from an environmental perspective. Originality/value: In the current global scenario, it is the notorious negative impact on the environment over the years caused by the architecture, engineering and construction industry (AEC). The integration of BIM–LCA can reduce time and improve the application of environmental analysis. Moreover, the proper application of a LCA method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the project can be hindered due to lack of information in the database about the materials or due to failures in the interoperability between BIM software and the LCA tool. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, there has been a lack of focus on the value that can be generated by using BIM during the design and construction phase. In this paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction processes? A literature review established the main areas to further address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases and into the construction and O&M phases with the use of structured data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further developed. The work also discovers and investigates how an academic institution can develop work methods through on-going development, tests and evaluation in collaboration with practitioners from the AEC industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Given the fragmented nature of the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry, building lifecycle management (BLM) involves bringing together multidisciplinary teams and integrating lifecycle processes of buildings. Despite the increasing use of information technologies and software tools by property owners, several barriers in BLM implementations remain, such as information silos, low data interoperability, poor cross-party coordination, and the mismatch of existing commercial solutions and user requirements. To deal with these practical challenges, this study develops a BIM-enabled BLM system for property owners using a semi-custom approach. For this, a three-tier architecture of the BIM-enabled BLM system is designed. Next, the system is developed based on a real-life project in the Grid State of China. This case scenario verifies the system and further confirmed the proposed three-tier architecture. The developed architecture and system have theoretical and practical implications for property owners' BLM implementations. This proposed semi-custom approach provides guidelines for AECO industry digital transformation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Circular Economy paradigm seeks to shift products and systems from linear to "closed loop" life cycles applying specific business models and strategies to their designs and lifelines. The implementation of the circular economy in buildings depends on the efforts made by all the stakeholder involved in the life cycle of a building, where it can draw most of the benefits if the application of a circular business model is planned during the design phases. Building Information Modelling is an approach that helps designers in creating and managing semantically rich 3D-models describing the status of the building over its life cycle.

	abstract = {Life-cycle analysis (LCCA) has become a necessary tool for green procurement for construction projects in many countries. Calculating life-cycle costs (LCCs) requires a variety of data that need to be gathered from diverse sources throughout the project life span. This information is usually stored in paper-based documents and are not well organized. These practices cause poor-quality data, which lead to incorrect results. Consequently, current LCCA in practice is extremely challenging. Data management is a major component for executing this sustainable development concept. This paper develops a relational database management system (RDBMS) that can support in calculating the LCCs of building projects. The system is structured to manage a large volume of design and construction data in a multi-parametric form. This allows users to integrate the proposed system with other modern construction platforms, especially building information modeling (BIM). In this paper, Autodesk Revit, a most widely-used BIM software, is adopted for authoring BIM models of a building and estimating relevant costs. Microsoft Access is used for developing a database management system (DBMS), which is designed to collaborate with the BIM models for LCCA. The system can significantly expedite the LCCA for a building with minimal errors and mistakes in data management and accurate LCCs. Copyright © 2020 ISEC Press.All right reserved.},

While the use of BIM begins to show its effectiveness in building construction, it does not satisfy yet linear infrastructure domain. One of the requirements is to manage the infrastructure project data around a common information system, as defined by the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) definition. Recent studies suggest the combined use of PLM and BIM for linear infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways. The advent of new information technologies, such as Digital Twin, is promoting industrial digital transformation. Effective lifecycle management must now consider all phases of the project, especially Operations and Maintenance (O&M), where the use of the 3D model is no longer the digital model, but the digital duplicate of the Infrastructure. To facilitate the digital transition when projects are split into several phases, the linear infrastructure must be represented by one and only one Digital Twin during its life cycle. © 2019 The Authors.

Besides, strategies to establish sustainability that can be activated. Then related sustainability indicators to the performance of project aspects were collected and categorized to facilitate linking with BIM platforms. Moreover, the potentials of the overlap between sustainability and many BIM platforms were examined and demonstrated, and their employability in supporting sustainability aspects in a balanced manner.

This paper aims at a critical investigation of the impact of VR technology on how sustainability and cost are understood and perceived by the users in building design projects, which could lead to improving and supporting the actual building design processes. The research study focused on evaluating design alternatives using Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled VR technology integrated with cost and sustainability life cycle assessment (LCA) software. In doing so, the paper begins with reviewing the relevant literature in the mentioned areas. Thereafter, it adopts an experimental-qualitative-quantitative method to test the research hypothesis and analyze the effects of 360-degree VR on the users (66 participants), while distinguishing between users who have a relevant background in building/construction engineering (i.e., architect engineers and civil engineers), and those who have not (i.e., owners and clients). It is observed that despite their background, the user participants positively embrace the ideas and aspirations of sustainability, and that there is some evidence of respondents preferring the economy over sustainability. Likewise, the participants are not making an effort to measure the emissions of their design options rather than focus on the building’s economic aspects. © 2020 by the authors.

This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management, where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems for asset management. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The awareness of the environmental impact of buildings during their entire whole life cycle has seen a growing interest in recent years. In fact, as buildings become more energy-efficient, life cycle impacts become increasingly important. Investors in the building sector are becoming aware of the direct and indirect benefits of a design process that enables the control of the impact of the building, ensuring the higher quality, intrinsic value of materials under a circular economy point of view. The durability is, together with reusability and recyclability, one of the main characteristics of construction materials. In this framework, the purpose of this paper is to describe a BIM-based approach to life cycle assessment (LCA) from the initial stages of the design of the Socrates Building in Viladecans. For this scope, a digital model in the TCQi GMA software was created to assist in the evaluation, optimization, and comparison of different design and construction alternatives. An integrated project delivery contract was adopted. These aspects altogether showed the potential of increasing the real estate value and the profitability of the building. This paper discusses problems that emerged during the digital project management, assessing criticalities and opportunities. © The authors.},

	abstract = {Buildings produce a large amount of carbon emissions in their life cycle, which intensifies greenhouse-gas effects and has become a great threat to the survival of humans and other species. Although many previous studies shed light on the calculation of carbon emissions, a systematic analysis framework is still missing. Therefore, this study proposes an analysis framework of carbon emissions based on building information modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA), which consists of four steps: (1) defining the boundary of carbon emissions in a life cycle; (2) establishing a carbon emission coefficients database for Chinese buildings and adopting Revit, GTJ2018, and Green Building Studio for inventory analysis; (3) calculating carbon emissions at each stage of the life cycle; and (4) explaining the calculation results of carbon emissions. The framework developed is validated using a case study of a hospital project, which is located in areas in Anhui, China with a hot summer and a cold winter. The results show that the reinforced concrete engineering contributes to the largest proportion of carbon emissions (around 49.64%) in the construction stage, and the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) generates the largest proportion (around 53.63%) in the operational stage. This study provides a practical reference for similar buildings in analogous areas and for additional insights on reducing carbon emissions in the future. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {An increasing degree of digitalization in construction planning offers significant potential for building life cycle assessment (LCA) to reduce access barriers, as well as the assessment effort itself. To realize the widespread application of LCA tools and their potential to effectively minimize life cycle impacts, an open approach is required that allows for flexible application of comprehensive LCA studies and early integration in planning processes. The authors present an approach for LCA integration in all phases of digital planning which aims at a DGNB (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur nachhaltiges Bauen) certification based on the open Building Information Modeling (BIM) standard Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The approach takes into account varying levels of development and resulting data availability during integral planning phases, as well as resulting LCA application contexts. It goes beyond existing strategies and allows one to consider both BIM and LCA software through a workflow based on a single data format. The assessment framework is operationalized through standardized interface development and technical realization following the information delivery manual (IDM) process standardized for IFC interfaces. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema, as a specific implementation for certification, provides the target system for LCA data requirements and is generalized to a planning phase specific IDM base table. The technical realization based on respective model view definitions and distributed data suggests a pathway to the standardization of LCA-IFC integration based on an open approach. The overall approach exemplarily applies to the "LERNZENTRUM" at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) campus. We conclude that an open BIM approach for LCA integration in model-based planning is feasible, but requires several adjustments in IFC, LCA, and planning practice. Adding a lifecycle element to the IFC to connect BIM and LCA provides comprehensive feedback for informed decision making based on environmental impact. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This article is the second part of a two-part study, which explored the extent to which Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used for End-of-Lifecycle (EoL) scenario selection to minimise the Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW). The conventional literature review presented here is based on the conceptual landscape that was obtained from the bibliometric and scientometric analysis in the first part of the study. Seven main academic research directions concerning the BIM-based EoL domain were found, including social and cultural factors, BIM-based Design for Deconstruction (DfD), BIM-based deconstruction, BIM-based EoL within LCA, BIM-aided waste management, Material and Component Banks (M/C Banks), off-site construction, interoperability and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The analysis highlights research gaps in the path of raw materials to reusable materials, i.e., from the deconstruction to M/C banks to DfD-based designs and then again to deconstruction. BIM-based EoL is suffering from a lack of a global framework. The existing solutions are based on local waste management policies and case-specific sustainability criteria selection. Another drawback of these ad hoc but well-developed BIM-based EoL prototypes is their use of specific proprietary BIM tools to support their framework. This disconnection between BIM tools and EoL tools is reportedly hindering the BIM-based EoL, while no IFC classes support the EoL phase information exchange. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a framework for the selection of construction systems of low and medium rise buildings used in residential, office and commercial applications. The construction systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage, use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse options. The developed framework integrates building information modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result. Application of the developed system to a university building revealed the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of SS framing system is 13.4% more. When the system is credited for possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse, the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS framing system becomes 22% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste management. © 2019},

	abstract = {The major environmental and economic burdens occurring from the high-energy consumption of buildings led to energy performance being a critical aspect for green building rating systems. Building energy codes play an important role for such performances through establishing the baseline requirements to meet the rating system needs. Building information modeling (BIM) was used to model a concrete masonry unit (CMU) block wall with various insulation thicknesses assigned various insulation layer thicknesses depending on the insulation material property. Multiple scenarios were created in compliance with several energy codes and its different versions. The scenarios modeled were then analyzed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calibrate environmental performance of different energy codes used as baseline codes for different green building rating systems. The results indicate the differences between the various green building rating systems according to respective energy baseline codes and their versions adopted. Tendencies towards more efficient with less environmentally harmful buildings were observed. Comparing the different codes with the direct impact on the green building rating systems shows that rapid development in energy codes surpassed the impact resulted from adopting the green building rating systems. The amount of reduction in environmental impact was significantly and tangible due to change in the energy code. © 2019},

To identify the best design, a holistic approach is necessary, considering emissions, energy use, direct costs, potential earthquake costs, etc. Accordingly, this paper addresses a multitude of lifecycle impacts associated with the manufacturing, construction, operations, damage, and demolition of buildings. All impacts are translated into a common utility, measured in dollars. A collection of cost models is developed, and detailed building models are created from BIM, i.e., building information modelling. A comprehensive analysis is conducted for a six-story building. Results show that the steel material option results in the lowest construction cost. The wood option results in the lowest cost of emissions, while the concrete option contributes the most to climate change. Earthquake damage accounts for about 3% of the total expected cost, but the worst-case earthquake cost exceeds the building value. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

As a solution, researches attempt to present workflows that include Life Cycle Costs (LCC) techniques in the evaluation of building assemblies. Some managed to integrate it with Building Information Modelling (BIM), while others focused on including the operating energy costs in the evaluation without the BIM integration. This paper aims to propose a more structured method that both combines the capabilities of BIM and energy simulations with the LCC can be developed employing the available efforts made. A case study is used to apply the proposed method, and the results show that around 17% LCC savings can be achieved when including the energy costs in roof assemblies. The proposed method can be used by facility managers or building design team to select the most cost-effective building envelope assembly. © (2019) by International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The building sector accounts for 40% of the energy use and one-third of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Buildings deteriorate with age, which leads to a decrease in their energy performance. Therefore, it is significant to improve the energy performance of aging building block although it is challenging. The two main decision paths for municipalities are renovation and reconstruction. This study investigated the above options for the older housing stock in a densely populated urban centre in British Columbia, Canada. A scenario-based analysis approach was taken to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions of six different renovation and reconstruction scenarios. The total life cycle emissions were calculated for each scenario including the embodied and operational emission, and the emissions from building construction and maintenance. A BIM-LCA combined approach was used to assess the embodied GHG emissions with the SimaPro software. HOT2000 software was used to model the operational GHG emissions. The results show that in the reconstruction scenarios, around 40% of the emissions are from the material manufacturing stage. The embodied emissions generated from the reconstruction scenarios are 5–6 times higher than the renovation scenarios. The life cycle GHG emissions of the existing house can be reduced by applying renovations, with the emissions saving gradually increasing with the level of retrofitting. The passive house reconstruction scenario delivers the greatest benefit in terms of life cycle emissions reduction compared to all other scenarios. In terms of the GHG emission intensity per unit area, the newly-built houses in scenarios 5 and 6 also have lower life cycle GHG emission per square meter than the renovated existing houses in scenario 1–4 after 15 and 10 years to breakeven respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that when considering the older existing building stock, a careful weighing of options must take place before making the decision on replacing them with new construction. However, it is also important to consider the economic and social aspects before making decisions to renovate or replace existing houses. The study outcomes will support city planners and urban development planners to make decisions on BC aging building stock development, especially in high population density neighbourhoods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Railway turnouts or so-called ‘switches and crossings’ are complex systems by nature of design and construction. Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3)has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management team. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The construction industry has become more interested in moving towards implementing an innovative method to reduce wastes and Environmental Impacts (EIs) during the construction stage. Tools and methods represented in different frameworks to estimate construction wastes are limited to the end of life stage of building projects. A common method employed for this quantification is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which is globally recognized as one of the most complete methods for the environmental impact assessment of buildings. Building Information Modeling (BIM) would be an ideal platform to integrate LCA to assist in this process. However, BIM and LCA tools are currently not fully interoperable. This research aims to represent a methodology to quantify total waste produced in the building’s lifecycle. The main reasons for producing waste are examined profoundly and some solutions leading to waste reduction are proposed. Additionally, the environmental impact of the materials converted to waste is evaluated in an integrated environment by developing an add-in inside BIM tool, which calculates waste produced in each step of buildings’ lifespan to be used by LCA tool. An application of an actual building project will be presented in order to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed approaches. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The conservation and maintenance of the historical heritage is an issue of great importance, especially when dealing with elements that can easily suffer damage along the time, either to intrinsic materials properties or by exposure conditions, like often happen for timber structures. For the management and maintenance of historic timber structures, HBIM (Historic Building Information Modeling) is here presented as a fundamental tool. This work presents the application of a methodology that uses common HBIM software in combination with results obtained from non-destructive testing and geometric surveying, allowing it to perform modeling, analysis and storage of geometric data, levels of decay and lack of material of timber structures within a tridimensional space. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates different time stages, thus allowing to make periodic comparisons along time, that substantiate a decision making process to take decisions about maintenance and intervention actions. In this work two case studies are used to validate this methodology and present its possible use. The case studies are: (i) the timber structure of the roof of the key tower of the Castle of Guimarães, and (ii) the timber structure of the ceiling and roof of the room of the Knight's Room in the Convent of Christ, Tomar, both Portuguese buildings listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The interest toward the life cycle assessment studies in the construction industry has been increasing in the last decades. However, there is no existing study that focuses on mapping the scientific research of the LCAs in the construction industry with a comprehensive understanding. Hence, an expansive and macro level study of the LCAs within the subject domain is necessary to fulfill this gap in the literature. The research objective of this study is to reveal the status quo, hot topics and keywords, and emerging areas of the LCA research in the construction industry. For this purpose, systematic bibliometric and scientometric analyses were conducted by referring 2885 bibliometric records published between 1997 and 2021 (end of February). The analyses indicated China, USA, and Spain as the most productive countries in the field. Additionally, hot keywords in the domain revealed as ‘energy’, ‘environmental impact’, ‘sustainability’, ‘performance’, ‘emission’, ‘building’, ‘system’, ‘design’, and ‘concrete’. ‘Circular economy’, ‘mechanical property’, and ‘footprint’ are found as the emerging areas of this field. Document co-citation clusters showed the hot research themes of the domain as building information modeling (BIM), energy performance, construction and demolition waste, carbonation, water supply, bridge design, optimization, pavement management, ventilation, and design assessment. The results of this research make a significant contribution to the scientific community and industry practitioners by providing an inclusive understanding of the recent status, hot keywords and topics, and emerging areas of the life cycle assessment in the construction industry. Further, this study would be a useful and valuable reference and guideline for the researchers interested in this field. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, there are lots of challenges to apply these techniques to actual bridge projects. For instance, bridge engineers are facing the challenge of making the vast information generated by their structural model useful for professionals further down the line in the lifecycle of the bridge. Contractors and inspectors require a 3D model which is created after the design process to add extra information related to activities and store that information in the same model.

Although BIM implementation in developing countries is limited, much research has focused on BIM drivers. However, there is less evidence to thoroughly investigate the influence of BIM barriers and awareness on the project lifecycle. This study addresses barriers to BIM implementation in building projects in developing countries. It investigates the influence of BIM barriers on awareness of BIM during the project lifecycle. Thus, a comprehensive literature review is required to build a conceptual model. Subsequently, the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was developed using a questionnaire survey tool. Data were collected from 90 building experts in Nigeria. The model's outputs highlighted that cost and standards, process and economic, technology and business, and training and people are the most critical barriers to BIM implementation that should be avoided. Furthermore, the model prediction revealed that eliminating BIM barriers has a minor impact on sufficient knowledge throughout the building project lifecycle. The findings provide the basis for policy making in developing countries concerning the successful completion of projects by avoiding BIM barriers; it will likewise enhance the success of building projects through BIM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Among them, is the integration of BIM in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis in order to automate the assessment of the potential environmental impacts. To date, despite the existing studies on the subject, there is still a need to define and establish a recommended assessment framework and software tool for LCA purposes when BIM methodology is used. This research analyses the current state of the implementation of the LCA analysis in the BIM process. Additionally, it compares the results from the use of two LCA software. For this purpose, a case study was modelled in the Autodesk Revit BIM platform and exported to two LCA specific BIM tools: Athena Impact Estimator and Tally. The life cycle impact results from both BIM tools, as well as the required workflows, are discussed and compared in order to validate results and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each. The results show that the implementation of the LCA method can be optimized in time and reliability by using the BIM process. Concerning the selected software, Tally has a better interoperability capability, user-friendly interface and a wider range of possible locations for the building. On the other hand, Athena Impact Estimator requires a detailed building characterisation to perform a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and has a broader materials database. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Whereas in the construction industry the associated future cost inflicts barriers on project sustainability. Therefore, Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) approach, which acts as an economic indicator has been considered for predicting the associated cost. While predicting the Life Cycle Cost (LCC), there exists inconsistency in the future data, thus an automation approach is required to minimize the variability in the cost prediction and analyse the LCC. The purpose of this systematic review is to spotlight on the implications of Building Information Modelling (BIM) which is an automated approach in performing LCCA. The relevant literature was extracted from the Scopus database. A total of 39 articles were extracted, afterward, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology is applied, and 24 articles are left for further interpretation. In the reviewed articles, the importance of BIM in measuring LCCA is highlighted. The BIM approach can help in quantity estimation and analyzing the future operation and maintenance cost for LCCA with accuracy. Whereas still, data acquisition is a barrier in performing LCCA. There is a need for a BIM library that consists of the required data parameter to perform LCCA, also an LCC schema is required such as IFC and COBie to assist in data exchange for LCCA. © 2020 IEEE.},

In Turkey, six million out of twenty-two million buildings need to be demolished and rebuilt to meet seismic standards. These buildings are also far below the standards in terms of energy efficiency. Therefore, urban transformation can be thought of as a great opportunity for energy efficiency. This study investigates four things: (i) the energy-efficient urban transformation strategy in Gaziosmanpaşa-Istanbul region, which is selected as a case study; (ii) the effect of energy efficiency in this market; (iii) the adequacy of energy standards of Turkey; and (iv) contribution of digitalization in construction to sustainability with Building Information Modelling (BIM) and energy analysis. According to the energy efficiency scenarios, energy analyses were carried out on the BIM model. The most cost-effective strategy was determined with the Life Cycle Cost method. When compared with the current situation, it is possible to save energy up to 227 GWh a year, which is equal to the annual heating energy demand of approximately 30,000 housing, in the case study area with the most efficient scenario to be realized. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

	abstract = {Currently, the built environment is one of the sectors that contribute the most to environmental impacts worldwide. As a result, the construction industry is increasingly adopting technologies and methodologies that promote the development of sustainable constructions, i.e. constructions that have low environmental, economic, and social impacts. Focusing on the environmental and economic impact of the construction, this research integrates the building information modelling (BIM) technology with the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies for the environmental and economic assessment of buildings. Building on the BIM-LCA/LCC framework and on the information delivery manual (IDM) and model view definition (MVD) for the BIM-LCA/LCC analysis, a BIM-based Environmental and Economic Life Cycle Assessment (BIMEELCA) tool is developed by the authors and detailed in this article. The BIMEELCA tool is used to support the decision-making process during early phases of a project and verify the feasibility of conducting automatic BIM-based LCA and LCC analyses in high-rise projects. A 250 m high-rise apartment, hotel, and office building is used to validate the usefulness of the tool at the early design stage. This case study demonstrates the feasibility to perform an automatic LCA and LCC analysis at this design stage by inserting in the model semantic information from generic databases. In the end, the benefits and limitations of the BIMEELCA tool are discussed.

The urgent requirement for energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the building sector has been recognised at the highest level of governments around the world. One potential solution, which has yet to be critically considered, is the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome building energy performance gap (BEPG), defined as the discrepancy between the designed and actual energy consumption in buildings. This study performs a systematic and comprehensive literature review to identify the specific causes of the BEPG, and then analyses the application of BIM for addressing the BEPG. A life-cycle BIM engaged framework was developed, including the function of “information exchange”, “design review”, “energy-related quality control”, “life-cycle commissioning”, and “real-time operation and maintenance management”. It is expected that the proposed framework will assist researchers and practitioners better understand application of BIM to systematically improve building energy performance. © 2020},

	abstract = {The life cycle assessment (LCA) of buildings is an important evaluation method for the environmental quality of buildings and their impact on climate and environment. However, this method is time-consuming and cost intensive. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has a high potential to integrate LCA into day-to-day planning. This research project aims to form the basis for BIM (semi) automation of whole building LCA by enabling the integration of LCA data using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The DIN EN 15804 compliant and open access ÖKOBAUDAT is used as the database for LCA data. As a result, a BIM-LCA framework is proposed that includes the development of an Information Delivery Manual (IDM) describing the LCA according to a German assessment system for sustainable buildings (BNB). Based on this, a Model View Definition (MVD) is developed, which defines the software subset of an IFC data model to meet the exchange requirements (ER) for a whole building LCA. Solution approaches for adapting LCA databases and IFC 4 are presented. Finally, a first prototypical implementation of these results for the (semi) automation of whole building LCA is developed. In summary, the proposed IDM and MVD enable identifying the information exchange required to perform an LCA within a BIM-based environment. They also provide the background knowledge to develop a BIM tool to perform an LCA based on the framework proposed. Thereby, this research project contributes to achieve higher environmental quality of buildings by combining sustainable and digital planning methods. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Its capability to bring in geometric and construction information can help reduce the time and uncertainty of the energy modeling process (Ham and Golparvar-Fard, 2015). However, during the design cycle, when both geometric and system data are updated continuously, the lack of methods to quickly insert system information in the BIM-exported gbXML has a significant impact on the modeling efficiency as well as the model integrity. This project aims to develop an open-source gbXML to EnergyPlus translator, the gbEplus, which provides flexibility for user-defined system modules plug-in. It adopts the OpenStudio reverse translator to ensure a quality geometry and construction data conversion. A plug-in interface is designed as the gateway for importing data from external resources to gbXML-EnergyPlus translation process in the run-time, and all the previously developed system modules can be stored in a user-defined library for reuse in the future. The gbEplus was developed and validated with models from Phase II gbXML geometry benchmark test documents. Two applications, for parametric design and model calibration, were developed to demonstrate the adaptability of this new BIM-BEM tool. © 2019 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

	abstract = {The construction sector is a major producer of greenhouse gas and waste. Several studies reveal the close relationship between the design phase and the reduction of environmental impacts caused during the life cycle of buildings, along with better economic and social performance. In order to achieve increasingly eco-efficient buildings, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an objective method to assess and reduce the impact buildings exert on the environment. Nevertheless, current environmental challenges require comprehensive solutions for the integration of the three pillars of sustainability, for which Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is recognised as an appropriate holistic concept. The present paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which aims to detect opportunities to integrate the LCSA into the building design process and in Building Information Modelling (BIM). The results show that the harmonisation of the three dimensions and the data requirements are main achievements. Based on results obtained, a methodological approach to help on the LCSA implementation in BIM is presented. This proposed LCSA-BIM approach is applied to the Spanish architect's workflow and design stages, to exemplify its purpose. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This study aims to explain how information management should be carried out in BIM and IPD projects, what activities should be managed by the information manager and which stakeholder should play this role and why? Design/methodology/approach: This study provides a framework on the subject by conducting a comprehensive systematic review in the field of real estate development, BIM, IPD and information management. In this context, the Web of Science and Scopus databases have been systematically reviewed, n = 45 out of a total of n = 1,356 articles and additionally, the BIM documents and standards prepared by public institutions and organizations and industry reports have been examined in detail. Findings: The framework for information management roles was established by reviewing the literature. According to this framework, information management activities of information managers are listed in the table that covers all phases of real estate development. The owner should undertake this role as it is the entity that oversees the built asset from planning to the management of that facility. Originality/value: In terms of acquiring information management roles, there is no research on BIM and IPD projects and who will take over this role.

	abstract = {Buildings contribute a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions and have the potential for large-scale impact reductions. Reducing the whole-life impacts of buildings is critical for creating a net-zero carbon built environment. For this to be achieved, the whole-life carbon impacts of design decisions must be considered during the building design process. A systematic review of academic literature was conducted to assess how life cycle assessment (LCA) is incorporated at various stages of the building design process, and what improvements are needed to support net-zero carbon design. The review compiled 274 papers that were published up to the end of 2019, of which 108 were subject to detailed review following screening. The review found that LCA is generally used late in the design process, when it is too late to greatly influence the design. Incorporating LCA with either building information modelling or life cycle costing is seen to have the same challenges as undertaking a traditional LCA. Parametric methods show promise for design development, but tools and algorithms require further verification and regionalisation to be implemented throughout industry. The use of benchmarks, target values and other pre-populated information can be used to incorporate life-cycle thinking without the need to undertake a detailed LCA. The review has demonstrated that LCA continues to face barriers, in both methods and practice, preventing its ability to guide early-stage design decisions and have a large impact on the environmental performance of buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The construction sector is a major contributor to global environmental impacts. This is one of the reasons why there is a political trend towards a "greener" sector. One indicator of this trend is the progressive application of life cycle thinking approaches and life cycle assessment of products, assemblies and buildings. The digitalization of construction projects, namely the use Building Information Modelling (BIM), can constitute a support to the automation of the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) at the building's design stage. However, besides the complexity of LCA model and results interpretation, BIM models usually lack LCA data that allow environmental impacts calculation. Currently, few publications explicitly relate the integration of LCA and BIM with the specificities of distinct development stages in the design and construction process or Levels of Development (LOD) of BIM objects. This paper summarizes the possible sources of LCA information to include in BIM models and discusses the complexity of LCA information needed for distinct BIM objects' LOD. A parametrization of environmental information is proposed, to be included in BIM objects, based on an evolutionary level of detail in LCA information for increasing LODs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the major concerns worldwide and greenhouse gas emissions plays an important role in increasing the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere. Furthermore, the construction industry is one of that presents a considerable environmental impact as it consumes large amounts of natural resources and energy. Aiming to investigate the environmental impacts, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology evaluates products and services showing the similarities and differences in evaluating midpoint and endpoint impact categories. This study reviews LCA from a building perspective and empowers the decision-making process and sustainable building design in the construction sector. The novelty is to estimate the operating energy performance and evaluate the endpoint impacts of building materials at an early designing stage, considering two methods of construction; concrete construction and steel construction. This work follows the methodological framework of LCA based on ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines within the available database, using Autodesk Green Building Studio application in Autodesk Revit and Open LCA software based on two assessment methods: IMPACT 2002+ and ILCD 2011. A case study of a multi-story office building is applied to achieve the objectives of this work. The building is structured at four levels of subsystems and associated construction materials: basic structure, walls, finishing, and windows. Results indicate that using steel construction instead of concrete construction is more environmentally friendly in such types of buildings. It encourages the application of innovative techniques in the production process to protect natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and protecting the built environment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The authors address the interoperability of the game engine and use LCC analysis to enhance visualization and education. Inexperienced owners or stakeholders have difficulty understanding the relationship between initial cost and LCC, and therefore typically choose the initial value, which seems economical from their point of view. The primary objective of this paper, however, was to create a BIM-game prototype that helps owners, stakeholders, or students visualize and quickly understand the relationship between LCC and initial cost. To this end, the authors create a BIM-game prototype that integrates BIM with a game engine simulation (i.e., Unity 3D) into an LCC analysis visualization. The BIM-game prototype allows users to navigate their building environments with the capability of simulating the LCC. The elements of the system are a combination from among many fields including architecture, engineering, computer programming, and game development. These elements connect various areas such as building modeling, animation, navigation, and collision detection. Changing the materials and adding construction accessories simultaneously improved the LCC and the interaction of game engine controllers and the player's interface. Finally, the authors developed a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIM-game prototype. The results show significant potential for using the system in future projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing concentration of Carbon footprint into the environment has drastically changed the climatic conditions. Among many anthropogenic activities, the housing sector remains one of the major contributors. However, a complete assessment of these environmental impacts throughout the life cycle still remains an area of concern. Most of the study does not assess the impacts by each phase of lifecycle. The current work presents a complete approach for carbon footprint assessment including planning, construction, operational, maintenance and dismantling dispose-off phase. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with boundary limitations of 'cradle to grave' was adopted. Thirteen housing units were selected as case study. These included detached, semi-detached and terraced types of construction. Selected units were developed in a virtual environment using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The study observed the average contribution range from 1.48 tons-CO2/yr to 2.85 tons-CO2/yr. On individual basis, the execution phase dominated the five phases with almost 43 %. The operational phase shared 39 % followed by maintenance (15 %), dismantling dispose-off (1.8 %) and planning at the last (1.5 %). The categorization of environmental impact into embodied and operational carbon footprint observed the embodied part in dominance. A strong positive relationship between the area of housing units and resulting carbon impact was also observed. The work presents one of few environmental studies for a tropical housing sector assessing complete life cycle. The study provides a vital guideline to the designers for ensuring a sustainable environment by assessing and opting less carbon intensive options at early stage of planning and design.  © 2021 Syed Shujaa Safdar Gardezi et al., published by Sciendo.},

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique is the most firmly established methodology used to quantify these environmental impacts and, therefore, has been applied with increasing frequency to assess the environmental performance of buildings. To effectively improve a building's environmental performance, an integration of LCA in the design process is required. This can be achieved by coupling LCA with digital design tools, e.g., Building Information Modelling (BIM). To identify the pro and cons of streamlining the integration of LCA and BIM, a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was performed. We identified more than 50 relevant BIM-LCA case studies and analyzed the applied BIM-LCA workflows in detail. In most of the studies reviewed, the LCA has been applied in an early design stage. The authors primarily used LCA tools and manual or semi-automatic methods to exchange data between BIM models. In most cases, contemporary BIM-LCA workflows utilized conventional spreadsheets (e.g., Excel worksheets). However, the results of the analysis show that an automated link between LCA and BIM can be achieved if certain challenges are overcome. By automating exchange of information between BIM and LCA tools and improving the reliability of this process, the LCA application can be streamlined in design practice and, hence, the necessary improvements of the environmental performance of buildings can be supported. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {A number of bridge infrastructures are rising significantly due to economic expansion and growing numbers of railway and road infrastructures. Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and process the integration of information in a shared environment. This paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance. This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.},

Optimization methods are at hand, but the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one source instead of having several unconnected product definitions. Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability between models from different domains and previous research reports on different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent research features BIM-based optimization, but there is still a question of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost. This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model, from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the optimization loop. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was developed and used in a case study of a Swedish multifamily residential building to test the framework's applicability in generating and optimizing multiple models based on the BIM-model. The prototype was developed to enhance the building's sustainability performance by optimizing the trade-off between the building's life-cycle energy (LCE) and life-cycle cost (LCC) when choosing material for the envelope. The results of the case study demonstrated the applicability of the framework and prototype in optimizing the trade-off between conflicting objectives, such as LCE and LCC, during the design process. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Property life cycle management is exposed to greater changes under impact of new BIM technologies and increasing demand for environmental approach. Many new technologies which BIM comprises, such as laser scanning, augmented reality, automate construction, distant access, renewable energy sources, affect management issues of project management leading to higher efficiency and environment protection via using greater cost predictability, improved schedule, optimized design, better coordination, and reduced energy and water consumption. Property life cycle management using BIM methods has priority over traditional management approach at each project stage, which generally leads to the extension of the life cycle and the construction of buildings with more environmentally friendly characteristics. The BIM management process affects all project parties. The article offers a special table which indicates changes for each participant: investor, developer, bank, designer, construction contractor, broker, tenant, project team, and re-conception team. Despite some controversial issues, like high costs and advanced skills of project participants, BIM management will be used by more developers, bringing economical and environmental efficiency for prolonged property life cycle. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.},

	abstract = {The water industry worldwide has been gradually transitioning towards digital asset management practices. Australia is no exception. However, these practices are often complicated by a lack of consistent models for gathering and maintaining up-to-date asset information across the industry. There is a need for innovative digital platforms and asset management solutions for making decisions that suit the increasing needs of the water sector. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can potentially be the conduit to asset management databases as it goes well beyond 3D models developed for use in the design and construction phase. The overarching goal of this research was to address the water industry challenge of implementing BIM to integrate digital data for the facility lifecycle as well as to provide information and decision support to asset management, and operation and maintenance. A number of workshops with asset managers and maintenance operators were held on the basis of a case study of a bulk water supply company in Australia. Stakeholders discussed specific expectations for the visualisation of information to ensure that data is used, understood and managed over the whole lifecycle. The barriers to the implementation of digital techniques for the purpose of efficient asset management were also explored. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon building design requests an estimation of total embodied carbon as the environmental performance metric for comparison of different design options in early design stages. Due to a lack of consensus on the system boundaries in building life cycle assessment (LCA), the carbon estimation results obtained by the current methods are often disputable. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for estimating building embodied carbon based on digital twin technology and LCA. The proposed method is advantageous over others by providing (1) a cradle-to-cradle LCA and (2) an automated data communication between LCA and building information modelling (BIM) databases. Because data for the processes in the life cycle are collected via digital twin technology in a standard and consistent way, the obtained results will be considered credible. So far, a conceptual framework is developed based on a comprehensive literature review, which consists of three parts. In the first part, formulas for LCA are given. In the second part, a hybrid approach combining semantic web with a relational database for BIM and radio-frequency identification (RFID) integration is described. In the third part, how to design the LCA database and how to link LCA with BIM are described. The conceptual framework proposed is tested for its reasonableness by a small hypothetical case study. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Modular construction has attracted increasing attention due to its energy and environmental benefits. Digital technologies such as building information modelling (BIM) have also been explored to generate and manage data through the lifecycle of buildings. Although research has been performed in the area of integrating BIM and modular construction, BIM-based automated lifecycle assessment (LCA) of prefabricated buildings remains unexplored. This study therefore aims to develop a BIM-based LCA method for prefabricated buildings incorporating different assessment levels with unique system boundaries and functional units. The developed approach can support automated assessments through all lifecycle phases of a prefabricated building. It is achieved through an automated process of creating parameters to merge LCA data into the building model, systematic zoning, model setup and impact estimation. This approach is applied to evaluate the energy and environmental performances of a case building in Hong Kong. The case study validated the efficiency of the developed BIM-based LCA method in providing a systematic and detailed assessment of modularly designed buildings. This study extends the knowledge in automated BIM-based LCA by addressing specific characteristics of prefabrication and promotes the incorporation of comprehensive and detailed LCA data into BIM models for improved design robustness and holistic performances of buildings. This validated approach will enhance the willingness of designers to apply LCA during the design stages for minimizing the energy and environmental impacts of both new and renovated buildings with prefabrication. © 2021},

It is regarded as an effective approach for green building development; however, its effectiveness has not been sufficiently investigated from a lifecycle perspective. To bridge this research gap, this study investigates BIM application value in different phases of a green building through a convolutional neural network (CNN) method. To begin with, an assessment framework was developed with the consideration of balancing the estimation accuracy and the data size. Then, the validity of the developed model was verified from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Finally, the effectiveness of BIM was tested using the proposed framework. Results showed that the overall score of the tested project was four in the five-point Likert scale, with an average relative error less than 1%. From a value-based perspective, it is revealed that the application value of BIM represented a descending order throughout the lifecycle of the tested project. In addition, it is found that the functional value obtained the highest score, whereas social value was at the bottom. The findings of this study can help decision makers to detect the weaknesses of BIM implementation during green building development. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a life cycle assessment framework for embodied environmental impacts of building construction systems. The framework is intended to be used early in the design stage to assist decision making in identifying sources of higher embodied impacts and in selecting sustainable design alternatives. The framework covers commonly used building construction systems such as reinforced concrete construction (RCC), hot-rolled steel construction (HRS), and light steel construction (LSC). The system boundary is defined for the framework from cradle-to-grave plus recycling and reuse possibilities. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment are integrated in the developed framework to evaluate life cycle embodied energy and embodied greenhouse emissions of design options. The life cycle inventory data used to develop the framework were extracted from BIM models for the building material quantities, verified Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for the material production stage, and the design of construction operations for the construction and end-of-life stages. Application of the developed framework to a case study of a university building revealed the following results. The material production stage had the highest contribution to embodied impacts, reaching about 90%. Compared with the conventional RCC construction system, the HRS construction system had 41% more life cycle embodied energy, while the LSC construction system had 34% less life cycle embodied energy. When each system was credited with the net benefits resulting from possible recycling/reuse beyond building life, the HRS construction system had 10% less life cycle embodied energy, while the LSC construction system had 68% less life cycle embodied energy. Similarly, the HRS construction system had 29% less life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the LSC construction system had 62% less life cycle GHG emissions. Sustainability assessment results showed that the RCC construction system received zero Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credit points, the HRS construction system received three LEED credit points, while the LSC construction system received five LEED credit points. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Productivity in the construction industry (both houses and infrastructure) has not been improving as expected, while other industries have been able to improve their productivity significantly. The appropriate use of building information modelling (BIM) technologies brings several benefits and advantages to construction projects. The main challenges of project efficiency emerge in the form of numerous requests for information during the construction project, which are considered to be waste in the processes. This highlights the need for a practical process model to plan the information flow for BIM-based projects. The main aim of this study is to propose a model to plan the flow of project information among primary stakeholders especially in infrastructure projects. Our main findings are firstly, the foundation for data management starts from defining unified one data for the product and the for the process. Unified data means one single repository of data - all stakeholders use the same unified data. It is also essential that data responsibilities and ownership are defined. Secondly, we found that the biggest challenges are that the data needs are not planned beforehand, resistance to change, difficulty receiving existing data and data must be modified before use. As a whole, it seems sometimes that the technology on data transfer is more important that what has been transferred and why. Finally our construction, the life cycle model for data flow originates from one data to all stakeholders, single data repository must be updated along the life-cycle of the object covering also the operations and maintenance, where the data has to be updated through the whole life-cycle. This new approach is intended to enable the early involvement of maintenance stakeholders in designing product data for a project lifecycle perspective. The model helps to change the current information flow and gain the benefits that a BIM-based process can offer. This study is based on case studies and is qualitative in nature and naturally needs more validation. © 2020 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings is a very important issue, where the operational demand is considered to be one of the highest amongst all other sectors of an economy. Moving towards energy efficient buildings is a key factor to achieve sustainability. A novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency of the resulting building designs adopted, along with reducing the difficulties associated with the construction of the building, in terms of cost of construction, is developed. The framework accommodates various parameters, via integrating mathematical optimization programming, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to improve the building performance, identify alternative sustainable designs, and empower the decision-making process and sustainability in the construction sector. Through the developed optimization model, the examination of various alternatives for building components that make up the envelope of a residential building is undertaken. Insights gained from the results show that all components of building envelopes influence the energy consumption in buildings, particularly, exterior walls and windows. Impacts in terms of annual energy use intensity can be reduced by about 45%, life cycle energy use and cost can be enhanced by more than 50%, and environmental impacts such as acidification and global warming potential can be reduced by more than 30%, due to use of the proposed framework. This work indicates that sustainable building decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and assessment of environmental impact via Building Information Modeling and life cycle assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technology that improves visualization, understanding, and transparency in construction projects. Its use in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA&C), while still scarce, is developing in combination with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, such as the choosing by advantages (CBA) method. Despite the holistic nature of MCDM methods, the inclusion of life cycle environmental metrics is lagging in construction projects in LA&C. However, recent studies point toward the need to optimize the synergies between BIM and life cycle assessment (LCA), in which a method like CBA could allow improving the quality of the decisions. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to integrate LCA and CBA methods to identify the effect that the inclusion of environmental impacts can have on decision-making in public procurement, as well as comparing how this final decision differs from an exclusively LCA-oriented interpretation of the results. Once the LCA was performed, a set of additional criteria for the CBA method were fixed, including transparency, technical, and social indicators. Thereafter, a stakeholder participative workshop was held in order to gather experts to elucidate on the final decision. The methodology was applied to a relevant construction sector problem modelled with BIM in the city of Lima (Peru), which consisted of three different construction techniques needed to retrofit educational institutions. Results from the LCA-oriented assessment, which was supported by Monte Carlo simulation, revealed a situation in which the masonry-based technique showed significantly lower environmental impacts than the remaining two options. However, when a wider range of technical, social, and transparency criteria are added to the environmental indicators, this low-carbon technique only prevailed in those workshop tables in which environmental experts were present and under specific computational assumptions, whereas teams with a higher proportion of government members were inclined to foster alternatives that imply less bureaucratic barriers. Finally, the results constitute an important milestone when it comes to including environmental factors in public procurement in LA&C. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The transportation infrastructure plays an important role in affecting the development of the national economy, which has developed rapidly in recent years. However, the cost of transportation projects is huge, and the traditional project process management causes a waste of time and resources. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is widely used in the building industry, but also can be used in the whole life cycle of transportation projects to improve the project efficiency. SWOT analysis is an important tool to assist the development of enterprises by analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. In this paper the authors use SWOT analysis to investigate the BIM application across the whole lifecycle of transportation projects and to provide advice for their future development accordingly. The result shows that although BIM can save time, money and resources, facilitate management and information exchange, and has a wide application prospect, there are still some technical and normative problems. Interaction between different specialties, information aggregation and fusion, and new regulations to deal with new technologies are all the problems to be resolved. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

In addition, the current studies of building information modeling (BIM)-based CWM failed to analyze the cost-benefits due to the lack of numerical economic benchmarks. To address the gap, this study developed a system dynamic (SD) model to analyze the economic aspects of construction and demolition (C&D) waste from using BIM. Causal loop and stock-flow diagrams are modeled based on the determined variables and their interrelationships. Standard sensitivity tests were then performed to establish the validity of the model under real system conditions. didierent scenarios were applied to simulate and compare the model results in response to various policies. A case study was conducted to quantify the costs and the profits. Based on the comparison with the conventional approach and BIM-based method, BIM can reduce CWM cost by up to 57%. The findings also indicated that higher landfill charges will not be able to motivate managers to use sustainable CWM; conversely, increasing the modularity of design and earlier realization of net benefits will incentivize project managers to employ BIM-based CWM. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The article deals with the data structure required for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of buildings using the Building Information Model (BIM) for implementation in the Czech construction industry. The construction industry produces a significant amount of waste while the capacity of landfills is being limited. The effective management of previously used materials that have the potential to be reused can significantly help to decrease consumption and save natural resources. LCA is a method that can be used to demonstrate the suitability of proposed materials, structures or buildings in terms of their whole life cycle and its environmental impact. For an LCA evaluation, it is crucial to obtain life cycle inventory (LCI) input data, though the structure of this data has not yet been clearly defined for the Czech environment. BIM includes, in addition to geometry, an information component which is applicable to this assessment. The aim of the article is to analyze previous approaches and define a BIM data structure for a particular material for LCI purposes. The new methodology is based on the standardization of a non-graphical information model data structure (SNIM) which was developed for the Czech construction industry. “Markup syntaxes” have been taken from the SNIM database and used to further identify the data for LCI base structure purposes. The MatLab matrix solver was used to classify these data. The advantages of the proposed methodology have been demonstrated via a case study of a monolithic concrete slab structure in which three types of concrete were evaluated. The results indicated the percentage of impact categories for each concrete type. These results are useful for expanding the BIM model with new data necessary for further LCA calculations. The extension of the BIM model via LCA calculations will lead to a reduction in the extraction of natural resources as well as a positive impact on the environment. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is an effective tool in determining the environmental impact of buildings. However, the LCA process requires extensive time and effort when applied to systems as complex as the life cycle of buildings. The development of Building Information Modeling (BIM) Platforms offers interesting opportunities to simplify the process for drawing up LCAs in the case of buildings. Recent research shows that the use of BIM-based methods leads to a significant reduction in time and effort which practitioners dedicate to applying the LCA methodology to entire buildings. LCA phases such as Life Cycle Inventory, traditionally extremely time-consuming, is almost self-operating when BIM resources are in use. The level of automation of LCA elaboration could be optimized by using a) the programming possibilities within the BIM platform framework; and b) the standardization of the models for analysis. In the last few years there has been significant progress in these two fields, based on a line of research proposed by the Master’s in Innovation in Architecture: Technology and Design in the University of Seville. There has been a considerable development of programming software integrated in BIM. Many regions have encouraged countries to use BIM platforms when documenting the construction process. This newconceptual framework provides the opportunity to assess the life cycle of numerous buildings in terms of the environment, obtaining specific environmental benchmarks for the different types. This communication describes a method proposed to obtain specific environmental benchmarks, - such as global warming potential and cumulative energy demand - for different types of dwellings using LCA methodology and BIM platforms. The application of this approach to different case studies is presented. The case studies selected for this research are those of housing located in different geographical and climate contexts and using different constructive systems (e.g. masonry construction, wood construction, steel construction). Finally, this paper provides the benchmarks resulting from the application of the proposed method to the case studies. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

The results identify three main approaches for BIM integrated LCA and LCC: (1) using existing BIM software to obtain bills of quantities and other data, (2) exporting data from BIM model to an external platform, and (3) including information within the BIM model. Additionally, applications in life cycle stages and possible future research directions are further discussed.

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic mapping (SM) study with the aim to determine how Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodologies and technologies contribute to energy-related analyses over the course of the entire building life cycle. The method adopted in the study is based on a set of seven research questions. We used a mixed technique combining co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling in order to analyze the publications' datasets for the period 2010–2020. The main advantage and novelty of this study are that the joint dataset from the Scopus and Web of Science databases was used to develop the keyword map. The main findings of this study indicate that many BIM-based applications can be used to analyze the building energy performance at all stages of the building life cycle. However, the applications of BIM in conjunction with other information technologies are limited and are still in the initial stage. In the future, the main improvements should be focused on process, model, system, tool, use and information modeling. The most promising long-term solution is an open BIM framework based on open standards, which allows the integration of BIM and energy simulation tools and satisfies specific data exchange require-ments. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the early building design stage, there are numerous uncertainties due to the lack of information on materials and processes. Designers therefore cannot quantify the environmental impacts of buildings in order to evaluate the environmental performance of their designs early on. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) and building information modeling (BIM) are carried out in the early and detailed building design stages. The method is applied to a residential building in Québec, Canada. The BIM is conducted with Revit, and the LCA with openLCA. To prepare the Revit outputs as the appropriate inputs of the LCA model, a functional database was developed. It includes all building assemblies, layers and possible materials commonly found in residential buildings in Québec. The ecoinvent database was used to source of life cycle inventory (LCI) data for each material. To manage information uncertainty in the early design stage, a probability function was assigned to each material. At the detailed design stage, all material types and quantities were specified in BIM file, which was used in the LCA study. The environmental impacts of the building stages and assemblies were calculated to determine the best building assembly options from an environmental perspective—a process that could guide building designers in the environmental assessments of their designs, making it possible to select more sustainable materials for each assembly and thus reduce the environmental impacts of the building. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, there has been no expert-based research into the true potential of BIM-based LCAs in a wider context with consideration of the advantages and disadvantages. This study aims to identify, classify, and prioritize these advantages and disadvantages using mixed methodological research and subject matter experts (SMEs). This includes a comprehensive literary review, semi-structured interviews with SMEs, and use of the Delphi method. A total of 21 advantages and 7 disadvantages associated with BIM-based LCAs were identified and classified. The advantages were grouped into four categories: decision making, material selection, sustainability performance, and waste reduction. The disadvantages were grouped into two categories: standardization and data processing. The Delphi method was applied via two rounds of questionnaires with ten SMEs to prioritize the advantages and disadvantages. The results of this study will provide practitioners and researchers with constructive information for the integrated use of BIM and LCAs and will create awareness in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The identified disadvantages show the requirements for future work and the priority rankings for both the advantages and disadvantages could be used by researchers and key stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Whole-building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has become a trend to address this limitation by ensuring the best environmental performance of a building. However, the current WBLCA development faces many challenges, which makes it difficult to create reliable and comparable results. This study aims to conduct a critical literature review to summarize the current challenges in WBLCA applications and the emerging approaches that might address these challenges. Three main challenges are listed: variances in goal and scope definition, building structure complexity, and varieties in the LCA database and methods. Emerging approaches are also presented to address these challenges, including the integration of building information modeling into WBLCA and environmental product declaration applications in impact assessments. The findings of this study could support researchers and decision-makers with the most popular approaches to conduct WBLCA and achieve reliable outputs. © Canadian Science Publishing.

	abstract = {As the building industry proceeds in the direction of low impact buildings, research attention is being drawn towards the reduction of carbon dioxide emission and waste. Starting from design and construction to operation and demolition, various building materials are used throughout the whole building lifecycle involving significant energy consumption and waste generation. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is emerging as a tool that can support holistic design-decision making for reducing embodied carbon and waste production in the building lifecycle. This study aims to establish a framework for assessing embodied carbon and waste underpinned by BIM technology. On the basis of current research review, the framework is considered to include functional modules for embodied carbon computation. There is a module for waste estimation, a knowledge-base of construction and demolition methods, a repository of building components information, and an inventory of construction materials' energy and carbon. Through both static 3D model visualisation and dynamic modelling supported by the framework, embodied carbon, waste and associated costs can be analysed in the boundary of cradle-to-gate, construction, operation, and demolition. The proposed holistic modelling framework provides a possibility to analyse embodied carbon and waste from different building lifecycle perspectives including associated costs. It brings together existing segmented embodied carbon and waste estimation into a unified model, so that interactions between various parameters through the different building lifecycle phases can be better understood. Thus, it can improve design-decision support for optimal low impact building development. The applicability of this framework is anticipated being developed and tested on industrial projects in the near future. © 2018 Esprit. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {All costs within the life cycle of a building are known as its life cycle cost (LCC). In the design process of a building, the use of a lower initial cost index to select an option among others with similar performance may not lead to an economically optimal alternative during the life cycle. Hence, today, building designers and investors require a tool to estimate life cycle cost at the conceptual design stage to select an economically efficient option. Resilient solutions generally lead to a higher level of complexity and upfront costs and carry additional embodied environmental impact as well. This study aims to support the design of resilient buildings using a sound LCC methodology in the preliminary design stage. The research aims to integrate LCC capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM) and increase the economical relevance and scientific robustness of LCC indicators towards better LCC cost optimization. The plugin, which is developed in the BIM tool is represented to use cost and resiliency factors to predict the whole process cost of building projects to assist designers in selecting a cost-efficient and resilient design option. The LCC of a building includes its initial cost, repair and maintenance cost, operating cost and salvage value at the end of the building's useful life, and all of which were considered in the estimation. The earthquake expected failure and human fatality cost are calculated to consider the resiliency index in building design. The application of the proposed framework to design a residential building is developed and validated on two design options. The application of the actual building project illustrates that by increasing the initial cost in the second alternative by 4.6%, its annual expected failure cost is decreased by 35.4%, and its total life-cycle cost is reduced by almost 10.4% within the first 45 years of operation. The reduction in the cost of the building and human fatality due to failure during an earthquake means the building's resilience would be improved. Using the developed plugin, designers could estimate LCC of the buildings at the early design stages and design more resilient buildings with better economic performance in its life cycle according to the proposed indices. © 2020},

The promotion of industrialized buildings is an important way to save energy and reduce emissions.

Building information modeling technology (BIM) can rely on parameter model to realize the sharing and transmission of building life cycle information, which opens up a new avenue for the study of building carbon emissions. Therefore, based on the wide review of previous literature, this study firstly divided the life cycle of industrialized buildings, then analyzed the carbon emissions within each stage, and built the parametric prototype system of life-cycle carbon emissions calculation based on BIM technology. This system will provide the basis for further calculating carbon emissions of various types of industrialized buildings so as to explore the carbon reduction space and ensure a low-carbon development of building industrialization in China. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Building information Modelling (BIM) lies at the centre of construction industry’s interest nowadays, with a revolutionary impact on the ways that professionals work, collaborate and conduct business. The application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape currently available for the construction industry across the various project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different software application areas, software architecture, interoperability possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated solutions addressed to advanced computer users. To this end, the paper aims to inform the industry’s stakeholders, policy makers and software vendors, while shedding light on the extent that sophisticated BIM solutions can be disseminated to the market. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

Objects and their information are being exchanged throughout the supply chain and throughout the lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur. Information is defined and interpreted differently by the different parties. Automated exchange of information in the industry is therefore not possible. The Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide national cooperation between partners in the total building sector, took the initiative to develop a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL)1: “one language for the building sector”. Based on the concept of “distributed libraries”, the library is mapped to other international and national libraries and classification systems. The CB-NL is an open standard, beneficial for all partners: More efficient exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer’s design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures arising from misinterpretation. Many national and international standards are mapped to the CB-NL by now. This paper describes the CB-NL and covers some practical experiences. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {As comprehensive sustainable design methods advance, whole-building life-cycle assessment (LCA) is becoming an important part of sustainable practices. The goal of this research is to evaluate the LCA tool Tally to establish a baseline process for LCA based on building information modelling (BIM). In order to generate benchmarks for whole-building LCA, the architecture, engineering, and construction industry must agree with the United States (US) government on a standard method of measuring embodied carbon in conjunction with a design tool. This paper involves a literature review and two case studies as a comparative software analysis between two whole-building LCA tools: the Autodesk-Revit-based Tally plugin and the Athena Impact Estimator (IE). The case studies include two different unit spaces–walls only in Case 1 and walls, windows, doors, floors, and roof in Case 2–that were analysed in Tally and the Athena IE to compare the user input parameters, outputs, life-cycle inventory (LCI) databases, and interfaces. The findings highlight the discrepancies between the two environments’ inputs and outputs, and offer best practice guidelines towards a BIM-based LCA process. While the emergence of BIM-based LCA tools offers to help users such as architects, engineers, and contractors who are not LCA practitioners, this research shows that the tools include specific data input biases and methods which impact LCA outcomes. Thus a deeper understanding on the part of the users is needed, along with improvements to the software interfaces. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are widely used to procure public infrastructure assets and are an effective mechanism for ensuring value for money. However, many PPPs in Australia have been plagued with controversy as they have experienced significant cost and schedule overruns during construction. Critical to the successful delivery of PPP projects is effective performance measurement/evaluation. Yet, conventional ex-post evaluation that solely focuses on meeting budget and a predetermined schedule are invariably applied to measure PPPs in practice. This paper reviews the performance measurement literature used to evaluate PPP projects and proposes that a life-cycle approach to their evaluation is needed to 'future proof' their performance and ensure value for money that is delivered to the public sector. As the primary focus of PPPs is to maximise profitability, there is a need to ameliorate the coordination and integration between the Special Purpose Vehicle, end-users and the public sector. This can be enabled through the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as it not only provides digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of an asset, but also provides key decision makers with the ability to make informed decisions across a project's life-cycle. When aligned with a series of core indicators that are used for performance measurement, it is suggested that BIM can act as a catalyst for 'future proofing' PPPs and enable the successful management of an asset throughout its life-cycle. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Energy consumption by and emissions from buildings contribute greatly to environmental degradation. Currently, an important tool in the study of architectural conservation design is LCA (life-cycle assessment), with the goal of minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact. The research suggests a method to apply LCA analysis and BIM technology to design 3D BIM models and define the relationship between BIM elements and architectural materials. The obvious advantages of combining BIM with LCA have resulted in its wide use for building life cycle assessment. The study propose here quantitative analysis of environmental impact by construction and build an index database for environmental impact assessment of building projects based on analytical hierarchy process. The design plan of the Teaching and Research Building of a University in Nanjing China is taken as the example to calculate energy consumption in response models formed from construction data. From these modeled calculations, then the key environmental impact factors were analyzed. The objective is to suggest an integrated solution to BIM-based environmental impact assessment of building construction and also provide a theoretical support for optimized building design. This case study demonstrates the utility of BIM when performing LCA, providing most of the information needed to perform LCA. © Copyright 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Construction works are in periodical need of performance upgrade such as maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MR&R). Facility managers are responsible to fulfil this need during the whole life cycle of the construction works in a manner that maximises the economical profit, minimises the environmental impact and keeps the risk of failure at a low level. A prerequisite for efficient facility management (FM) is long-term planning of MR&R actions. This requires management of a large amount of information, a process that includes gathering, storing, processing and presentation of data. With the development of open Building Information Models (open BIM) and standardisation of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) new possibilities of efficient management of FM information have emerged. Due to its parametric and object-oriented approach, the open BIM-concept rationalises the information management and makes it more cost effective. This paper discusses how open BIM, with the aid of IFC, and Product Life Cycle Support (PLCS) may facilitate the implementation of a predictive Life cycle Management System (LMS) and by that improve the feasibility for adopting long-term and dynamic maintenance strategy in the FM process. A case study on the use of a commercial BIM-based design tool as information repository and media to present life cycle information within the context of the LMS concept on a hospital building is also presented. The case study shows that the build-up of the information becomes simpler, more clear and efficient compared to a traditional database solution, as it is done with parametric objects. However, the basic BIM can not serve for all LMS functions. There is still need for development of a BIM integrated LMS solution that may support prediction of life cycle performance and maintenance needs. Such a solution needs to be communicative to any open BIM software and thus has to be built upon open standards for exchange of building information, e.g. the IFC standard, and life cycle oriented standards like PLCS. Additional focus is put on 4D simulation and visualisation. Simulation and visualisation of long-term performance of buildings is of crucial importance when improving the feasibility for adopting a long-term and dynamic maintenance strategy in the FM process. © 2011 The authors.},

Part of this data concerns performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first, integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating uncertainty and computing risk metrics. Finally, the evaluation of risk levels is supported by the use of semantic web technologies through a risk ontology. © 2017 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The increased popularity of building information modeling (BIM) for application in the construction of eco-friendly green buildings has given rise to techniques for evaluating green buildings constructed using BIM features. Existing BIM-based green building evaluation techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the "green template") for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials. Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2D takeoff), and its reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of ≤5%. This study aims to develop a system for assessing the impact of the substances discharged from concrete production process on six environmental impact categories, i.e., global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), abiotic depletion (ADP), ozone depletion (ODP), and photochemical oxidant creation (POCP), using the life a cycle assessment (LCA) method. To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Furthermore, the information about facility components should be managed throughout the lifecycle and be easily accessible for all players in the AECOO industry. BIM is emerging as a method of creating, sharing, exchanging and managing the information throughout the lifecycle between all the stakeholders. RFID, on the other hand, has emerged as an automatic data collection and information storage technology, and has been used in different applications in AECOO. This research proposes permanently attaching RFID tags to facility components where the memory of the tags is populated with accumulated lifecycle information of the components taken from a standard BIM database. This information is used to enhance different processes throughout the lifecycle. A conceptual RFID-based system structure and data storage/retrieval design are elaborated. To explore the technical feasibility of the proposed approach, two case studies have been implemented and tested.},

In addition, the article explores the engineering dimensions of common decision-making procedures within BIM systems including optimisation methods, buildability and safety constraints and code compliance limitations. The research presents critical expositions in both engineering and sustainable energy domains.

	abstract = {Building demolition waste presents a significant challenge due to its large scale. Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition, collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However, previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could contribute to as high as 45% of carbon emission reduction despite only accounting for 0.66% of the total weight. Across various lifecycle stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of carbon emissions. Furthermore, a large scale inventories are developed as an outcome of this case study. These findings provide useful inputs to the future endeavor of building demolition waste recycling in a bid to reduce the associated carbon emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The energy intensity indicators of the alternative overhang designs, as well as their energy depreciation time are presented.

However, only a few life cycle inventories (LCIs) have been developed in certain countries with prevailing boundaries and scopes which prevent them from being applied directly to a different location. Therefore utilizations of overseas LCI with valid modification have become an effective way to expand the usage of existing LCI as well as to quickly establish a localized inventory. This study aims to develop a framework which makes use of non-local LCI data and Building Information Modelling (BIM) to evaluate the environmental impact of local construction materials—specifically, total carbon emissions from the “cradle to site” process of construction materials. Framework inputs, outputs and data conversion methods are analysed in a detailed manner. A case study in Singapore which focuses on carbon emissions generated from cement production and transportation is employed to showcase the application of the proposed framework in LCA practice. The result obtained was compared with the actual benchmark to validate the framework's performance. The estimated percentage of error was 2%, which is much smaller than the one from raw LCI of 14%. Discussion and sensitivity analysis regarding to the robustness of the results in the presence of uncertainty have also been discussed. The result can expand the existing knowledge of cross-boundary LCI usage for construction materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is the consideration of all 'relevant' costs and revenues associated with the acquisition and ownership of an asset. LCC has a number of relevant applications, these include project appraisal; facilities management; procurement and tendering and as a means to evaluate sustainable construction. Although these advantages are well recognised, the process is underutilised due to a number of documented barriers to adoption. Notably these include lack of accurate historical databases; the perceived complexity and time consuming nature of the calculations; lack of a standard LCC methodology, and that clients are not requesting LCC. The research presented is framed in recognition of these barriers, investigating a process that could affect change by increasing efficiency in this area. A Building Information Modelling (BIM) approach to construction procurement is being increasingly utilised as a collaborative set of procedures and associated technologies that assist design and construction professions in conceiving, designing, constructing and operating the built environment. Although 5D BIM (Cost Modelling) is currently being used in Quantity Surveying (QS) practice, BIM is not extensively used in the application of LCC and there has been limited research in this area to date. The research demonstrates the development of a 5D BIM based LCC solution, where LCC is integrated into the 5D BIM process by embedding an LCC calculation model structure within an existing 5D BIM technology. This process represents a change to the 5D BIM workflow, adding on a facility for LCC through post-processing BIM data. The research is carried out under a design science research methodology, to develop and then evaluate the solution proposed. An evaluation method known as 'Thinking Aloud cooperative evaluation' is used to gain feedback from a sample of QSs utilising the 5D BIM based LCC solution. The purpose of the evaluation is to gauge whether LCC can be effectively embedded in a 5D BIM platform. The contribution to knowledge is the articulation of a process which extends 5D BIM for LCC, by leveraging an existing 5D BIM technology. The findings outline that the primary benefits of the proposed process/system is that it allows for a link between the QSs cost plans/BOQ's and their LCC calculations in an integrated environment. © 2017 The author(s).},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) into building design decision making due to LCA's comprehensive and systemic approach to environmental evaluation. Many green building rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices), design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed. Finally, this paper examines the traditional building's systems that are usually involved in LCA and the possibility of adding other systems, such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems, using building information modeling (BIM). © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for more than 40% of global energy usage and as much as 33% of global greenhouse gas emissions in both developed and developing countries. However, the study of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4% of the total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction stage accounted for 12.6% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately 2% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage. Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings. However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use phase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it has a widespread impact on the industry, the systematic implementation of BIM in projects faces challenges. This study integrated BIM into the lifecycle of a building project with the introduction of a conceptual framework constituted by BIM Information Flow, BIM Model Chain, BIM Workflow, BIM Institutional Environment, and BIM-based Project Management Information System (PMIS). This conceptual framework identifies the key areas for integrating BIM into the project lifecycle and explains how BIM works for project management practice. Through an ethnographic action research approach, the study developed a BIM roadmap for the project lifecycle by systematically implementing BIM in the building project. The major findings and pieces of evidence derived via the implementation support the conceptual framework. The following discussions explain how BIM disrupts the project from the view of organization design and clarify the contributions of this study in project management, as well as BIM adoption and integration. Finally, the conclusions focus on the development of this research, the role of the conceptual framework to underlie the BIM roadmap, and the research limitations.

There are however still financing opportunities for building projects that are perceived as less risky. Buildings that are not only sustainable, but also flexible and adaptive, are becoming attractive alternatives for traditional buildings. Many innovative concepts are combined in a new form of contracting, called the Living Building Concept. In this concept, buildings are continuously adapted to changing user and/or client needs in the form of Product/Service combinations. In this paper we will zoom in on the implications for building information modelling and construction ICT. Object based, parametric design technologies become more important than ever before. The new business concepts require a life-cycle modeling approach in which individual components and materials play a central role. Buildings are considered as temporary configurations of these components and materials. The functional life of buildings, which strives for higher and sustainable end-user value, becomes detached from the technical life of building components and materials, offering new opportunities for reuse, remanufacturing and recycling. © 2009 The authors.},

On the other hand, energy cost has a high contribution with the building Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for the owners. Subsequently, reducing energy consumption by selecting the best design options during the initial stages of any residential project is one of the key factors to that issue. The target of the proposed framework is to find the optimal design that gives a minimum life cycle cost over the building life span. The integration between Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to reach the near-optimal solution. BIM is the simulation tool to generate the building design and dynamically analysis for the energy consumption of the house. The role of GA is to reach the solution by setting the effective variables and use a measurable objective function with proper constraints. The proposed model automatically identifies the most suitable house components to reach the minimum LCC during the design stage. Parametric programming language is used to facilitate interoperability between BIM and the other components of the model. © 2016 IEEE.},

The superior goal of all BIM-related research projects at the Chair of Construction Management and Economics is therefore to advance the efforts of data model standardization and the corresponding flow of information between all participants involved in a building project. To identify all relevant data, the focus of each project is hence directed to the question who needs which information from whom, how, when and what for. In this context the research project "Development of an ideal chain of process for using the BIM-method during the lifecycle of real estate" aims to develop and define a standardized and idealistic virtual chain of process using BIM. Therefore, the actual process structure (without BIM) will to be analyzed and defined in consideration of relevant regulations, interviews of experts etc. In this respect, the performance spectrum of each participant and the communication as well as information interface will be taken into account. Up from this point the process can be enriched with BIM-content to create an ideal BIM-process-chain. It will be important to develop a most general-purpose to include different variations of project organizations and market players. By doing so, it will be possible to transfer the BIM-method to all real estate and civil construction participants. Copyright © 2017 ISEC Press.},

	abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The goal of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the integral overarching digital modelling of all properties regarding a building as well as its construction. This is targeted through the integration and support of all involved experts. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this task, the necessary data often only exists in a very fragmented and uncoordinated way throughout different departments. BIM tries to mediate between the different views of its users and allows for a coordinated accumulation of data, as well as synchronously keeping the planning status up to date. However, in most cases this available information is still not used throughout the complete lifecycle of the building. Clear gaps exist between the different phases of planning, construction as well as use and maintenance. Within this paper we aim to give an overview of possible BIM data, as well as its relevance for construction processes. This is especially considered from a process automation viewpoint, in order to identify the required interfaces as well as missing and irrelevant data for assembly processes within construction. Based on this a BIM informed design to production becomes possible. Primary goal is the development of strategies for the creation of BIM-aided planning processes that continue into actual fabrication and construction and are efficient in terms of time, energy and costs considering changing user demands and the resulting usage requirements. We address the lifecycle of a building using the concept of BIM. Therefore, we also consider the required information for future conversion and refurbishment of the building, in order to complete the lifecycle approach of BIM. Hence, we give a first brief overview of possible techniques for modelling pre-existing buildings within BIM, as well as the required level of detail (LoD). Looking closer at the LoD for different lifecycle phases.},

Upon literature and practice research, we discovered that BIM ontology has not been properly defined during project life cycle on the whole. There are various existing interpretations of BIM and related acronyms, but these interpretations only describe BIM from a specific perspective regardless to general relationships. This can result in problems and misunderstandings during communication, coordination and contracting. Research shows, that it is possible to understand BIM in three different ways: 1) BIM as a product, 2) BIM as a method and 3) BIM as a methodology. This paper also explores broader understanding of BIM as a methodology and proposes the correct BIM ontology - we use schematics, and explain the role of BIM in traditional project life cycle phases. We propose strict differentiation between model and modeling, and we describe relationships between BIM and other IM (i.e. PIM, PLIM, CIM, DIM and AIM). Proposed ontology ought to be useful in both research and practice. In BIM standardization process, BIM implementation, and development of BIM related tools, it is necessary that all parties understand common ontology in the same way.

	abstract = {Global climate change is one of the most significant environmental impacts at the moment. One central issue for the building and construction industry to address global climate change is the development of credible carbon labelling schemes for building materials. Various carbon labelling schemes have been developed for concrete due to its high contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, as most carbon labelling schemes adopt cradle-to-gate as system boundary, the credibility of the eco-label information may not be satisfactory because recent studies show that the use and end-of-life phases can have a significant impact on the life cycle GHG emissions of concrete in terms of carbonation, maintenance and rehabilitation, other indirect emissions, and recycling activities. A comprehensive review on the life cycle assessment of concrete is presented to holistically examine the importance of use and end-of-life phases to the life cycle GHG quantification of concrete. The recent published ISO 14067: Carbon footprint of products - requirements and guidelines for quantification and communication also mandates the use of cradle-to-grave to provide publicly available eco-label information when the use and end-of-life phases of concrete can be appropriately simulated. With the support of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and other simulation technologies, the contribution of use and end-of-life phases to the life cycle GHG emissions of concrete should not be overlooked in future studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

There is a general lack of professional information in BIM-based designs. The AECOO (architects, engineers, contractors, owners and operators) industry should therefore take the initiative to achieve a broad consensus about the specification of relevant information that should be standardized as content in the objects. Improved exchange of information in BIM-based software will support integrated design and delivery solutions. Objects/object libraries are proposed as the container for the exchange of information. Software objects (doors, windows, walls) and object libraries (selections of objects) with specified professional information (measurements, performance, energy, fire resistance, noise reduction, etc.) are called 'BIM objects'. The 'role-and life-cycle information model' (RIM/LIM) concept is suggested as a framework for development (specification) of relevant information in different roles and phases of a building's life cycle. A 'BIM object information standard' can be based on the RIM/LIM framework. Content in the BIM objects can be included as specifications in information delivery manuals and BIM guides. © 2010 Earthscan.},

The number of existing buildings needing refurbishment actions justify the need of an intervention model that optimise its service life after the refurbishment process. So, a refurbishment, maintenance and costs planning should be established and guided by value for money principles. The aim of this paper is to analyse the application of Buildings Life Cycle Management (BLCM) to a case study under a refurbishment process, to study the specific solutions and to assess the correspondent service life using the factor method according the ISO 15686 family. With this study, was possible to assess solutions and refurbishment conditions in terms of durability, when compared between the different proposals. In order to improve the case study Building Life Cycle maintenance, in addition, was applied Building Information Modelling (BIM), as BLCM is connected with BIM in order to highlight the importance of their inter-relationship. This study concludes about the most advantageous type of maintenance, how BIM can contributes to BLCM and how can improve maintenance plans. Thus, this study contributes to highlight the importance of preventive maintenance, to promote its implementation and consequently, to use maintenance plans reducing life cycle cost and increasing materials service life. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

LCC requires increased information compared to traditional building cost calculations. Use of building information modelling (BIM) based software should therefore lead to a high increase in LCC calculations for every project. However, this is not the case. The purpose of this study is to understand why BIMbased LCC calculations are not used more often. Integrated design and delivery solutions (IDDS) from CIB are used as a framework to explore practical use of LCC. IDDS focus on collaborating people, integrated processes and interoperable technology. This study is based on a combination of exploring BIM-based software, literature review and semi structured interviews with relevant stakeholders in building and civil engineering projects. The study identifies a gap between the process, the people, and the technology. Increased use of LCC calculations would benefit from increased integration rather than development of separate factors. IDDS has proven to be useful in understanding factors involved in practical use of BIM-based LCC calculations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the life cycle CO2 emissions when an apartment housing with 'flat-type' blocks (the reference case) was replaced with more sustainable 'T-type' blocks with fewer CO2 emissions (the alternative case) maintaining the same total floor area. The quantity of building materials used and building energy simulations were analyzed for each block type using building information modeling techniques, and improvements in LCCO2 emission were calculated by considering high-strength concrete alternatives. By changing the bearing wall system of the 'flat-type' block to the 'column and beam' system of the 'T-type' block, LCCO2 emissions of the alternative case were 4299 kg-CO2/m2, of which 26% was at the construction stage, 73% was as the operational stage and 1% was at the dismantling and disposal stage. These total LCCO2 emissions were 30% less than the reference case. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Based on the current situation of LCM and Building Information Modeling (BIM), this paper proposes a theoretical model of BIM-based information integrated platform for sustainable construction projects. Process models for LCM and the design phase implementing BIM-based information integrated platform are built using IDEF0 modeling method. Then, the whole process of using BIM-based information integrated platform in sustainable construction projects is analyzed through its application in a real-life construction project in Shanghai. This paper analyzes the function and application methods of BIM to promote sustainability in each phase. Meanwhile, some important best practices are analyzed and discussed, which are significant to future projects. The results of applying BIM-based LCM method are evaluated through one-to-one expert evaluations interviews. The findings show that applying BIM-based information integrated platform to the full building life cycle is vital to reduce environmental loads and improve sustainability. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The innovation of building information modelling (BIM) technology provides a new means of predicting, managing and monitoring the environmental impacts of project construction and development through virtual prototyping/visualisation technology. This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The researchers studied worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft2 office building was developed and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings energy consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of building energy consumption in the context of green building rating systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into consideration both energy sources and building efficiency. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

In addition to models for structural responses, the new components contain models for construction cost, repair cost, environmental impact cost, and human health cost. Random variable objects represent uncertainties in material properties, hazards, and cost models. Similarly, design variable objects represent decisions, such as structural dimensions and materials.

	abstract = {The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the integral and comprehensive digital modeling of all properties regarding a building, its planning and construction process as well as maintenance and use. This is combined with the overarching objective within BIM to integrate and support all involved experts aiming towards an improved collaboration. Currently the necessary data often only exists in a very fragmented and uncoordinated way throughout different subsections, as well as planning and construction phases. A lack of organized information management is especially noticeable in finalized built objectives during questions of conversion and refurbishment. BIM tries to mediate between the different views of its users and allows for a coordinated accumulation of data, as well as synchronously keeping the planning status up to date. However, in most cases essential information is missing or not used throughout the complete lifecycle of the building. Consequently, there are clear gaps between the different phases of planning, construction and maintenance. Within this paper, we give an evaluation of applicable methods for data collection and modeling of the actual inventory of components with regard to position, geometry and semantics (e.g. material) for the purpose of a comprehensive and BIM-compliant as-built documentation. This allows the analysis of missing interfaces and data. Considered from a process automation viewpoint, we identify missing BIM data e.g. for assembly processes within construction in order to create a BIM-aided planning process that continues into actual fabrication and construction. Based on this, we discuss possibilities for the implementation of user requirements in order to develop a comprehensive semi-automated decision support tool for BIM users. Primary goal is to provide concepts for the integration of construction processes as well as options for conversion planning and construction of buildings. These targets imply a continuous updating of the BIM models (including the semantic parameters) from a continuous ‘as-built’ acquisition and modeling of the construction progress. While BIM primarily is being discussed as a cooperative working methodology in the new planning of buildings, we also consider the required information for future conversion and refurbishment of the building and the required level of development, in order to complete the lifecycle approach of BIM. © 2018 WIT Press.},

The value chain of an uninterrupted information for energy models based on design data (e.g. for new buildings) or on paper documents and additional surveys (e.g. for existing buildings) is crucial to perform a reliable design optioneering process. The present research applies a BIM2BEM approach to provide a public administration with a model for facility management (i.e. BIM) and a model to assess energy improvement and check the choices (i.e. BEM), as a pilot project on school buildings renovation. Schools are frequently out-of-date buildings in harsh need of structural and energy refurbishment and public administrations require consistent economic evaluations considering the payback time of the proposed solutions. Additionally, O&M (Operation & Maintenance) costs should be included in a life cycle evaluation of the buildings. Two schools with different layouts and configuration adopted as case studies to compare energy simulation to actual consumption. The workflow empowers the energy simulation results highlighting the accuracy of energy modelling in different situations and it introduces possible tuning strategies to decrease uncertainty. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

	abstract = {Decisions made during a building's early design stages critically determine its environmental impact. However, designers are faced with many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result, designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements, and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A multi-building residential development is used as a case study for introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant reductions in embodied carbon footprint. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The use of Building Information Models (BIM) and the digital exchange of information in the construction industry is growing rapidly. Objects and their information are being exchanged in the supply chain and the lifecycle. When exchanging information, problems occur. Information is defined and interpreted differently by the different parties. Automated exchange of information in the industry is therefore not possible. The Dutch Building Information Council, a sector wide national cooperation between partners in the total building sector, have set the ambition to create a Dutch Concept library (CB-NL): "one language for the building sector". Based on the concept of "distributed libraries", the library will be tuned to other international and national libraries and classification systems. Creating this common language in a combined national effort will be beneficial for all partners: More efficient exchange of information, better communication throughout the entire supply chain and lifecycle, new possibilities for product manufacturer’s design and digital product catalogues and less expensive failures arising from misinterpretation. This paper describes the principles of the CB-NL and how this will help to make BIM-models for the life cycle of the build environment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a way of working with open-standard building information modeling (BIM), object type libraries, systems engineering and an Information Delivery Manual for the management of information over the life-cycle of infrastructure assets. The concept is presented as a source of inspiration, proof of concept and to underpin the value of different parts of the concept leading to an integrated approach to life-cycle information management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a concept for a way of working. A proof of concept is provided in the form of a case study in which this concept is operational. It shows that this way of working using open-standard BIM can be applied to manage information in the life-cycle. It does not provide, nor suggest to provide, empirical evidence for specific benefits in terms of efficiency. Findings: The paper shows that open-standard BIM can be applied for information management in the life-cycle of (construction) assets. The specific approach that is applied in practice in a Dutch Infrastructure Project is explained including a case project. Research limitations/implications: The example of Traverse Dieren attests to a implementation of the approach in practice. From this case it can be concluded that the suggested approach is feasible in the initiation and design phase and applicable during realization. Based on the example as described in this paper it cannot be concluded to what extent the known information management problems in the life-cycle are solved. Therefore a detailed evaluation on the information exchange would be required which is beyond the scope of this paper. Practical implications: This paper shows how different (theoretical) concepts are successfully combined and implemented in practice to attain the defined BIM goals. Originality/value: This paper shows a practical case implementation of open-standard BIM (using COINS). It provides a way of working that combines BIM, systems engineering, libraries and contractual arrangements for the management of information over the life-cycle of infrastructure assets. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Despite the apparent simplicity of existing BIM-LCA tools, there is a lack of integration with the main BIM software, and the double-effort of design development and parallel simulations is a barrier to their implementation in the design process. Moreover, simplifications on these tools may provide misleading results to the designer. The main aim of this research is to develop an integration interface of manufacturer-based LCA data into a BIM platform by combining applications of existing and consolidated tools (namely, Autodesk Revit and Dynamo, and Microsoft Excel), in order to obtain environmental profiles for decision-making in the initial design stages, requiring less time, effort and ad hoc experts. The methodological procedures were aggregated into the following system development and testing phases: (a) input data organization, (b) creating new parameters on BIM software, (c) visual programming, (d) results analysis for decision-making and (e) simulation of social housing. The results of the developed tool provided complete results automatically, not requiring the designer to make changes in the software or interfaces. Some limitations were identified during development and application, due to the lack of LCA data availability by manufacturers, the complexity of data programming importation and extraction on BIM software for different construction subsystems, and the complexity of LCA results analysis and understanding encountered by non-experts. Regarding the latter, the research concluded that broad knowledge dissemination is still necessary to improve awareness regarding this environmental assessment methodology, in addition to determining the most advantageous environmental performance parameters, as a reference point for comparison. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The challenge that sustainable buildings movement faces is, "how to maintain the intended sustainable performance with regards to low energy use, indoor comfort and projected operating costs savings over the long term use of the building" Rapid decline in sustainable performance of a few high-profile buildings affects credibility of the High Performance buildings initiatives, reinforces doubts amongst climate-change non-believers and slows down the enthusiasm of the investors. Examining the lifecycle performance and costs, raising the awareness of building owners and tenants, adopting the best operational and maintenance practices by trained and skilled operating staff, and incorporating measurements, verification and automation technologies to automatically track and optimize the performance of all key buildings systems needs to become an essential part of property management culture to avoid pitfalls. Emergence of Building Energy Labeling Program and Building Information modeling techniques coupled with energy use sub- metering can alert of issues during commissioning, building occupancy, tenant-fit ups, building-use changes or of decline in performance due to poor operations and maintenance management. Building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems are significant users of energy as well as their operations and maintenance impacts the health and security of tenants. Therefore, proper design, configuration, commissioning, operations and maintenance of such systems continues to offer opportunities for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, and any lapses in monitoring and correcting deficiencies creates shortfall in sustainable performance over the life of a building. As the largest single landlord in the United States, the Federal Government oversees about 500,000 federal buildings. With additional resources being made available under the Recovery Act funding, new tools are emerging to allow monitoring and control of energy use. This paper outlines various qualitative and quantitative measures that can be practiced to improve and sustain performance of all building systems and infrastructure elements. Amongst all the measures, having trained and motivated operations and maintenance staff involved from concepts stage through design, construction, commissioning, and operations not only facilitates meeting the original design intent, but also allows to make adaptive changes with changes in occupancy, functionality, codes, standards or security requirements. Such general practices can assure sustenance of energy and environmental performance over the life cycle of systems and buildings. This paper also emphasizes how industry professional and trade organizations can guide towards standards and guidelines that can be more easily assimilated by the operations and maintenance staff and can help modify human behavior towards not only designing, but maintaining a more socially and environmentally responsible built-environment. © 2011 ASHRAE.},

The paper addresses this common limitation offering an integrated sustainable structural analysis at building level. To achieve this, a BIM-embedded approach was established utilising embodied carbon metrics and results from heuristic structural optimisation. A real building scenario was used to test the proposed approach in the context of multi-storey reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Results show how the building life cycle performance is affected by the use of structurally optimised designs. The structural floors in particular, not only cover the largest proportion of the embodied carbon in the structure but they are also responsible for a large proportion of the carbon emissions of the tested building elements. The results obtained in this paper justified the need for more comprehensive efforts in the design optimisation of RC floors.

This paper explored the feasibility of applying the principles and rationales of BIM for capital project lifecycle management in luxury yacht design, engineering, fabrication, construction and operation. The paper examined the premises and backbone technology of BIM. It then evaluated leading naval engineering and shipbuilding software applications and their development trends from the functional lens of BIM. To systematically investigate a BIM-based approach for capital project lifecycle management (CPLM) in the luxury yacht industry, the paper proposed and outlined an implementation framework. A case study and a student competition use case were discussed to delineate the core constituents and processes of the proposed framework. The case of BIM was reviewed. Through the domestic custom luxury yacht design and prototyping student competition, the application of this framework in educational research is demonstrated and the initial quantitative assessment of the framework is carried out. Conclusions: a BIM-based CPLM implementation framework can help the luxury yacht industry capitalize on the global transformation to an information-centric and data-driven new business paradigm in shipbuilding with integrated design, manufacturing and production.},

A combination of the BIM-based design and analysis tool Revit Architecture, the energy simulation tool Green Building Studio (GBS) and the LCA tool ATHENA Impact Estimator were used for the assessment. The LCA was carried out on a life case study of a 2100 m2 two-floor primary-school building, as well as a variability analysis, by varying the material specification in terms of whole building materials. The life cycle performance of the buildings was primarily evaluated in terms of its global warming potential (GWP) and health impact. The findings of the study show that irrespective of the materials used, buildings that are based on renewable energy perform better than those based on fossil fuels over their life cycle. In terms of building materials, both environmental and health preferences of buildings congruently range from timber, brick/block and steel to insulated concrete formwork (ICF), in descending order. The study suggests that as buildings become more energy efficient during operational stages, serious attention needs to be given to their embodied impact. The study lays out a methodological framework that could be adopted by industry practitioners in evaluating life cycle environmental impact of different BIM-modelled material options at the building conception stage. This has the tendency to ensure that the highest proportion of life cycle environmentally beneficial material combinations are selected during specification and construction. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Researchers present a case study of two consecutive pilot redesigns for fourth-year architecture and construction courses. Professors coupled design interoperability in the studio and reflective assessment of student learning with electronic portfolios. The architecture professor emphasized integrated project delivery and collaborated with the engineering professor's construction management course that emphasized value engineering. Students engaged emerging information technologies of building information modeling (BIM) along with electronic portfolios to present and reflect on their learning processes. Student projects demonstrated enhanced visioning, communication, collaboration and coordination of optimized building design. The student's power to communicate intentions within a BIM environment promoted an enlivened review between designer and construction manager.

This paper aims to develop a closed-loop lifecycle management system that can enable a consistent stream of information for use and reuse of all stakeholders. The framework integrates the state-of-the-art smart construction, construction automation and internet of things (IoT) technologies to help fragmented practitioners access and manage the information via a standardized interface among various applications throughout the whole lifecycle. Within the closed-loop lifecycle management system for IoT-based smart construction, digital technologies such as 3D laser scanner, drone, building information modelling (BIM), augmented reality (AR), Auto-ID, global positioning system (GPS), wireless sensor network (WSN), robotics, mobile digital devices, and web-based applications are used to collect proactive data from different stages. Further, the data are stored, shared, processed, and utilized in one unified platform for all stakeholders to support better decision-making and interaction throughout a project lifecycle. The framework is a guideline of real-time visualized tracking and operation, real-time environment supervision, real-time feedback and alarm, cloud backup, and data analysis demonstration which enable smart construction from head to toe. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

This building's life cycle CO2 emissions were divided into three parts: the construction, operation, and demolition stages. Among these, the statistics on the schedule of quantities were generated using BIM, and the energy consumption during the building's operational stage was obtained using ECOTECT simulation. Sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several alternative parameters, to identify which parameter has more impacts on building performance. The paper demonstrated that (1) BIM and Ecotect are very helpful in estimating carbon emissions from a building's life cycle, (2) the primary and effective measures to reduce the building's CO2 emissions in hot and humid climate should be arranged as follows: (a) within the limits of comfort, reducing the fresh air volume; (b) extending the indoor temperature range; (c) improving the thermal insulation performance of exterior windows, walls, and roofs; (d) exploiting natural ventilation during transition seasons, and (3) currently there are some limitations in performing LCA based on BIM and Ecotect. © 2015 Changhai Peng and Xiao Wu.},

In recent years, the wide application and development of Building Information Modelling (BIM) promote the development of informatization and digitalization of AEC/FM industry. However, due to the limitation of a one single tool and lack of understanding of single source of truth, the problems of the industry cannot be solved completely. Therefore, the revolution and innovation of industry can be stagnated. Internet of Thing (IoT) and blockchain can be considered as two technologies that can be integrated with BIM for AEC/FM industry. The aim of this paper is to understand and analyse the basic principles and the applications of these three technologies in AEC/FM industry through literature review. With the integration of these three technologies, the virtual and realistic object and data during the whole building lifecycle can be managed and stored in a security, transparency and convenient decentralized common data environment (DCDE).

	abstract = {This paper investigates how sociotechnical actions such as adoption, reuse, and recombination of designs and processes enable the users of building information modeling (BIM) tools to not only achieve productivity improvements in particular activities, but to build system capability that enables new ways of working. The evolution of BIM as digital infrastructure is studied in a network of companies developing and using BIM tools for new ways of working in the Finnish HVAC industry. The research methodology is a deductive case study testing a theoretical framework derived from the literature. The main finding is that BIM has emerged as digital infrastructure in design and construction, while development has stalled in use and operations. The explanation for the successful outcome in design and construction is found in the evidence of three sociotechnical actions of adoption, reuse, and recombination activating self-reinforcing positive developments in design and construction. The stalled development in use and operations is explained by a lack of adoption and reuse, which in turn inhibits the tool and process development required for increasing adoption. Servitization by extending project duration and aligning the business of actors to life cycle performance, standardization of interfaces and processes, and open architectures are identified as actions to activate digital infrastructure evolution for the later life cycle stages of a building. The originality and value of the paper is to demonstrate how the theoretical framework of sociotechnical action explains the emergence of BIM as digital infrastructure and how findings can be applied to identify specific management interventions to enable more successful outcomes. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Currently, efforts are being made to standardize the use of 3D models for the design of infrastructure projects within governmental bodies; however a clear framework that delineates the way in which the operation and maintenance data can be integrated into the design model is evidently lacking. Also, there is a tangible absence of a methodology that provides a systematic and automated base for leveraging the already existing project-level life-cycle data for the integrative management of infrastructures networks. In this paper, we propose a life-cycle approach for the infrastructure information modeling, whereby the 3D model will evolve from a design platform into an all-round information management tool whose applicability spans across the entire project life-cycle. Furthermore, the idea of incrementally building an infrastructure network management system based on the aggregation of project-level information models, e.g. BIM, is explored. A case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Genetic Algorithm Optimization and Monte-Carlo Simulation. The developed framework helps in implementing a stochastic Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) model for building to select the optimum building materials alternatives and discover the most influential building system in each cost element starting from initial cost to end on life cost. Genetic Algorithms Optimization technique is utilized to select the optimum alternatives of building systems taking in consideration sustainability aspects. The Monte-Carlo Simulation model is used as a fitness function for the optimization model. The environmental aspect of building is achieved by considering the maximum number of points that can be awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the optimum solutions that are chosen by optimization a model to examine the effect of different building systems on LCC and its components through computing the rank order of building systems and the target output. A case study is presented to demonstrate the practical features of the proposed framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the recent years the issue of BIM is gaining increased attention and there is a growing number of practical applications of BIM. The basis of BIM is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), 2013, published as International Standard ISO 16739: 2013. IFC constitute an open data format for data exchange between different types of software applications, used in design, construction and subsequent management of buildings (Facility Management), i.e. throughout their entire life-cycle. Authors created within the international project SE-Lab an application for data conversion to structural analysis (Structural Analysis View MVD). The structural data are converted from IFC standard to ATENA software input format, which is suitable for the nonlinear FEM analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures. The functionality of ATENA solution core has been extended in order to solve some of previously unsupported load types which are part of the IFC standards. Integration of the NLFEA with stochastic and degradation modeling allows to assess life-cycle reliability of civil engineering structures or structural elements. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},
