The introduction of hydrogen energy with high operational flexibility enables the multi-energy complementary system to fully accommodate renewable energy. The key issues of the optimization planning of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen multi-energy complementary system that need to be solved are how to finely characterize the carbon reduction potential of the system, consider the uncertainty of supply and demand in the modeling process, and incorporate the energy supply business of electric vehicles into the planning. This study constructs optimization planning model with the following three progressive stages: geospatial suitability simulation based on geographic information system, uncertainty analysis based on probabilistic scene generation technology, and capacity configuration optimization. Unlike previous studies, this model measures and optimizes the carbon emissions level of the system from a lifecycle perspective. The empirical study results indicate that carbon emissions optimization from the perspective of the entire life cycle would directly affect the system configuration results. From a lifecycle perspective, the carbon emissions accounting result is about 9 times higher than that obtained only during the operation phase. Compared to the traditional distribution system, the carbon emissions of the system constructed in this study decreased by 82.75 %. In addition, considering that the system provides charging services for electric vehicles, which can reduce carbon emissions by about 93.6 % but only increase costs by about 29.4 %. The computational results justify the proposed optimization framework. This study provides optimization models for the system, and the implementation framework can support technical reference for practice. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity configuration optimization; Carbon emission reduction; Geospatial simulation; Life cycle assessment; Multi-energy complementary system; Optimization planning","Carbon sequestration; Clean energy; Direct air capture; Life cycle assessment; Low emission; Zero-carbon; Capacity configuration optimization; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Complementary systems; Configuration optimization; Geo-spatial; Geospatial simulation; Multi energy; Multi-energy complementary system; Optimization planning; Carbon capture and utilization","Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, (2022D01C665); Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Fundamental Research Funds for the Autonomous Region Universities, (XJEDU2022P023); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (23YJCZH328); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (ZD133); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ( 2022D01C665 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Autonomous Region Universities ( XJEDU2022P023 ), the Research Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education ( 23YJCZH328 ), and the Major Project of National Social Science Fund of China ( 21&ZD133 ).

However, previous studies made strong assumptions to avoid modelling spatial heterogeneity of carbon footprints or ignore weather and shadowing effects on PV electricity generation, making the estimated results unreliable and even causing false policymaking. To tackle this challenge, we developed a novel model coupling multi-sourced data modelling and life-cycle assessment to estimate spatially heterogenous carbon mitigation of all the operational rooftop PVs in an entire city. It is built by three hierarchal modules: (i) segmenting PV areas from high-resolution satellite imagery, by using Deep Solar PV Refiner, an advanced semantic segmentation network; (ii) estimating electricity generation in the segmented PV areas, by using a well-developed 3D solar irradiation model that considers the effects of land surface solar irradiation influenced by weather and shadowing effects produced by 3D buildings; (iii) quantifying carbon mitigation potential of PVs, by developing a spatial-aware life-cycle model to track the life-cycle carbon footprints of PVs from production, transportation, operation, to decommission. Investigating Singapore by 2020, we reveal that industrial, airport, and residential areas have the largest rooftop PV installation. We also suggest a carbon emission rate of 13.20 g-CO2/kWh, a carbon payback time of 0.81 years, and an energy payback time of 0.94 years, showing an improved carbon mitigation capability compared to the past years. This study contributes to GIS data modelling and helps understand the geospatial characteristics of urban-scale PV carbon mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon mitigation; Deep learning; GIScience; Life cycle assessment; Rooftop photovoltaics; Solar energy","Singapore; 3D modeling; Carbon footprint; Deep learning; Irradiation; Power generation; Satellite imagery; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Carbon mitigation; Deep learning; Electricity-generation; Giscience; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaics; Rooftop photovoltaic; Shadowing effects; Singapore; Weather effect; alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity generation; GIS; life cycle analysis; mitigation; photovoltaic system; satellite imagery; solar power; Life cycle","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Research Institute for Land and Space; General Research Fund of Shanghai Normal University, (15603920, 15602619); General Research Fund of Shanghai Normal University; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (1-CD81); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局","Man Sing Wong thanks the funding support from the General Research Fund (Grant No. 15602619 and 15603920 ) and the Collaborative Research Fund (Grant No. C5062-21GF ) from the Research Grants Council , Hong Kong, China, and the fund (Grant No. 1-CD81 ) from the Research Institute for Land and Space, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong, China.","L.

This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management, where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems for asset management. © 2022 by the authors.

However, during its lifetime, a building is an important part of its immediate surroundings; hence, its lifecycle must not be managed in isolation as a single entity without considering its participation in the immediate surroundings. BLM must consider in what way surroundings influence lifecycle and how a building impacts its surroundings. The use of geographic information system (GIS) has been reported in a range of studies for supporting various tasks of building lifecycle in which BIM is lacking. Understanding the participation of a building in its surroundings is also done by using GIS, however potential use of GIS in the entire lifecycle of a building has not yet been investigated. The review of literature produced a list of application areas of BIM and GIS which may possibly improve existing BLM processes, specifically, the possible ways to consider surroundings, site constraints, locational effects, and services of nearby facilities/utilities. An interactive and collaborative practical framework has been developed by using the main application areas of BIM and GIS seamlessly in various stages of BLM, enabling data reuse in all stages, developing efficient designs and plans, and making sustainable decisions. The developed framework was used for the lifecycle management of the building project taken as a case study. It has been established that the application areas of both BIM and GIS have a coordinated solution to makes BLM a multidisciplinary perspective.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","BIM; Construction management; GIS; Information management; Lifecycles","Geographic information systems; Life cycle; Stages; Building Information Model - BIM; Building life cycle; Building lifecycle management (BLM); Efficient designs; Entire life cycles; Integrated frameworks; Life-cycle management; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Architectural design","","","V.K.

An assessment of the energy demand and environmental performance of building stocks at large spatial scales is increasingly needed for decision support in sustainable planning and policy making. While current bottom-up building stock models mainly focus on the operational energy use, a new research trend has introduced Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for a more holistic environmental performance assessment including several stages of the building life cycle. This paper reviews a set of selected bottom-up LCA studies evaluating the environmental impact of building stocks at several scales, from urban to transnational. The selected studies were analyzed according to three common elements: building stock aggregation model, energy analysis and LCA. Two main stock aggregation approaches, archetypes and building-by-building, are applied to model individual buildings and extrapolate results at the stock level. Bottom-up energy models, either statistical or engineering-based, provide energy profiles for the operational phase of buildings. LCA is subsequently performed to assess the building environmental performance and support policy decisions. Current limitations and opportunities for the improvement of the LCA of large building stocks are finally addressed and discussed to support future works. Building stock aggregation models may be enhanced by addressing model calibration, integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and stock dynamics models. Uncertainty propagation, sensitivity analysis and model simplification are recommended for energy models and LCA to bridge data gaps and reduce computationally intensive models. Future research is encouraged on the inclusion of climate change, evolution of the energy supply and integrated modeling for the LCA of building stocks. © 2017","Bottom-up; Building stocks; Decision support; Energy consumption; GIS; LCA","Buildings; Climate change; Climate models; Decision making; Decision support systems; Energy conservation; Energy management; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Geographic information systems; Life cycle; Public policy; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Aggregation model; Bottom up; Building stocks; Decision supports; Energy demands; Energy model; Energy-consumption; Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment; Performance of buildings; Energy utilization","","","A.

Despite their global significance, land use impacts are still rarely addressed, although methods for integrating land use into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the development and calculation of regionalized characterization factors based on the LANCA® (Land Use Indicator Value Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment) method to be integrated into LCA using a geo information system (GIS). Methods: With the publication of the LANCA® characterization factors (Bos et al. 2016), land use impacts can be assessed at the country level. However, soil parameters as well as climatic conditions change on a small scale and are very site-specific. Therefore, there is a need for regionalized characterization factors. After a literature review, we describe the development of the five LANCA® indicators. Afterwards we present the conceptual framework for the calculation of GIS-based characterization factors and apply this framework to two examples, the indicators of mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration. Finally, we apply the characterization factors in a case study. Results, application and discussion: The region-specific characterization factors are calculated in a GIS environment yielding a map with values for mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration per grid cell for various land use types. A case study shows that land use impacts fluctuate due to site-specific conditions such as pedological, topographical and climatic conditions. It can be shown that our calculation of regionalized characterization factors in global maps is feasible and facilitates an area’s potential for causing lower environmental impacts for a certain land use compared to other areas. Remaining challenges are related to input data quality, the comprehensibility of the results to practitioners that are not land use experts and the technical restrictions of LCA database and software providers. Conclusions: Through the presented regionalization of the LANCA® framework, a necessary prerequisite to method advancement is met as also region-specific characterization factors can now be calculated. In comparison to the published country-specific characterization factors in Bos et al. (2016), the developed regional GIS-based characterization factors are far more advantageous especially for large countries. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that an LCA including the evaluation of land use does not replace methods and tools like environmental impact assessment. When deciding on a preferable location for a specific land use nature conservation, geographical, geological and building law aspects must also be taken into account. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecosystem services; GIS; LANCA<sup>®</sup>; Land use impact assessment; Maps; Regionalization","article; calculation; climate; conceptual framework; data quality; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; filtration; grid cell; human; human cell; information system; land use; life cycle assessment; physician; regionalization; software; soil","Erich Ritter Foundation","This work has been partially funded by the Erich Ritter Foundation.

The demand for improved accuracy and credibility of LCA results has increased the need for LCI containing higher data granularity and quantified uncertainty. In this study, a novel data processing method is proposed to facilitate regionalized LCI database compilation and uncertainty characterization. The key step in the proposed method is to retain variations within the datasets by building a relationship between the geographical and temporal quantified characteristics and material/energy input amounts using multilevel modeling (MLM) rather than losing the variations via a traditional aggregation method. The uncertainty is objectively characterized by the model prediction interval. An example case study is conducted on nitrogen fertilizer application for corn production with data collected in 19 U.S. states from 1990 to 2016. The results show that estimates by the proposed approach are more accurate than those by current aggregation methods. For the unit-yield-based input and unit-area-based input, respectively, around 60% and 80% of variations within the datasets are explained by MLM, and 86.1% and 96.8% of the unrepresentativeness factors for the MLM estimates are less than 0.2, compared to 62.3% and 70.5% when traditional three-year aggregation is used. The 95% prediction intervals cover more than 95% of measurement data in both input cases. It is suggested to apply an MLM-based data processing framework for future database compilation or for reinforcing a geographical information system (GIS) based regionalized LCI database. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data processing; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory assessment; Multilevel modeling; Regionalization; Uncertainty quantification","Data handling; Data processing; Database systems; Nitrogen fertilizers; Uncertainty analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Multilevel model; Regionalization; Uncertainty quantifications; Life cycle","U.

Methods: This methodology was based on the characterization of data and life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS), which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose. The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national transport at the country level; and local, represented by external factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m2 core shelter unit consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material: bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions’ variability and uncertainty analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed, and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed. Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for each country. Results and discussion: The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the construction materials’ transport distance. Therefore, the level of impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be achieved with low environmental impacts. Conclusions: The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately represent the range of production practices used outside Europe. Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design and recognising the structural needs in specific locations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Buildings; Earthquake; GIS; LCA; Python; Regionalisation; Transport distance; Wind","Article; bamboo; building material; case study; controlled study; decision making; earthquake; electricity; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; geographic information system; life cycle assessment; priority journal","","","E.

At present, interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact. Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75% of carbon emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement routes were located according to the types of transport used and the location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level. The impact of the building in the production, construction, de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use of the three tools - LCA, BIM and GIS - allowed us to establish that the highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix, which contribute to the sustainable development of the city. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Building information modelling; Eco-efficiency matrix; Geographical information system; Life cycle analysis; Urban concentration","Architectural design; Environmental impact; Information systems; Information theory; Information use; Life cycle; Matrix algebra; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Building Information Modelling; Eco-efficiency; Eco-efficiency matrix; Efficiency matrix; Geographical information; Geographical information system; Life cycle analysis; Urban concentration; Urban systems; Use Phase; Geographic information systems","","","J.C.

The goal of this paper is the development of a framework for the characterization of building material stocks and the assessment of the potential environmental impact associated with the end-of-life of buildings at the urban scale to support decision on waste management strategies.

Nowadays, the housing sector represents about 40% of the energy consumption in the European Union. In this regard, the level of insulation installed in buildings is directly related to the energy efficiency of the building, and consequently to the urban area. In addition, several studies have shown that a comprehensive perspective of energy efficiency is needed, together with calculating the importance of introducing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology to: first, measure the energy efficiency level of specific urban areas and their buildings using a geospatial model in an integral perspective; and second, the environmental impact caused by the refurbishment of these building façades using a LCA method. On the one hand, according to a bottom-up framework the quantitative and qualitative characterisation of the building stock façade at the urban scale is possible generating a georeferenced spatial data model of buildings using Geographic Information Systems. On the other hand, the environmental impact of the most usual constructive solutions to refurbishment building façades is calculated using the LCA methodology. The results obtained are merged and interpolated to the urban scale. The methodology is tested for the case study of blocks of flats in Barcelona using the open data of building stock from the Spanish Government. Firstly, this methodology provides more information in regard to urban areas as well as calculating their energy efficiency. Secondly, the study measures the renovation impact of the less efficient buildings. Finally, the results provide the basis for supporting decisions on building stock retrofitting for urban scale from a new approach, especially making the selection between various renovation scenarios much clearer. © 2017 WIT Press.","Carbon footprint; Façade; Geographical information systems; Life cycle assessment; Retrofitting; Spain; Urban scale","Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Spain; Buildings; Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Bottom-up frameworks; Constructive solutions; Efficient buildings; Energy efficient building; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low carbon economy; Spain; Urban scale; building; carbon footprint; energy efficiency; environmental impact; European Union; GIS; life cycle analysis; refurbishment; spatial data; urban area; Energy efficiency","","","","","WITPress","17437601","","","","English","Int.

It is crucial to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with prefabrication technologies for sustainable development. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research utilizing advanced technological tools to examine and visualize GHG emissions in prefabrication. To address this gap, this study employed a multi-information method that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) with a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to analyze and calculate the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from prefabricated components and buildings during the production, transportation, and construction stages in China. The results indicate the following: (1) GHG emissions per cubic meter for the prefabricated exterior wall, balcony, and stair are 1080.77 kgCO2eq/m3, 867.84 kgCO2eq/m3, and 1902.63 kgCO2eq/m3, respectively, with an overall average of 1138.58 kgCO2eq/m3 for prefabricated components. (2) The production phase is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions, accounting for 96.11%, while the transportation and construction phases contribute 3.30% and 0.59% of the total emissions, respectively. (3) The selection of prefabricated construction can lead to a 31.62% reduction in total GHG emissions per square meter, with emissions of 269.16 kgCO2eq/m2, compared to traditional construction with emissions of 393.63 kgCO2eq/m2. The study contributes to the knowledge body by providing a systematic method for calculating GHG emissions and offering traceability and visibility of GHG emissions for prefabricated components and prefabricated buildings. These findings can serve as practical references for future research to achieve the construction industry's green and low-carbon goals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","BIM; GIS; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle analysis; Multi-information integration; Prefabricated construction","China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information retrieval; Life cycle; Building Information Modelling; Case-studies; Construction sectors; Construction time; Greenhouse gas emissions; Information integration; Life cycle analysis; Multi-information integration; Prefabricated components; Process efficiency; emission control; GIS; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; spatial distribution; transportation system; Gas emissions","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71772125); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was conducted with the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71772125 ).

As increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a major contributor towards climate change and given that the construction industry is one of the major producers of GHG emissions, it is crucial to meticulously quantify and lower its emissions, especially in the context of developing countries. This research presents a novel framework by combining advanced tools i.e., building information modeling (BIM), life-cycle assessment (LCA), geographic information systems (GISs), and quantification of embodied emissions to optimize construction’s design, material-selection, operations, maintenance, and waste-management processes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated with the help of a real-world case study in Islamabad, Pakistan. A building model has been generated using BIM, and a comprehensive LCA has been conducted. Additionally, GIS tools have been utilized to identify the locations and accessibility of available-waste-management facilities. Based on this data, embodied emissions related to handling and transportation of waste material to disposal facilities have been computed using mathematical analyses. Furthermore, targeted mitigation strategies have been proposed and an optimized route has been designed using GIS-based route-optimization tools along the suggested facility centers in the Islamabad region. The case study has been reassessed with alleviation strategies, and the results show that 29.35% of the materialization stage, 16.04% of the operational stage, and 21.14% of the end-of-life-phase GHG emissions can be effectively reduced. Hence, pre-evaluating the environmental degradation caused by construction projects throughout their life cycle might offer an opportunity to comprehend and reduce prospective environmental impacts. © 2024 by the authors.","building information modelling (BIM); carbon emissions; construction and demolition waste; greenhouse gases; life-cycle assessment; site-suitability analysis","Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Construction; Construction industry; Demolition; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Information theory; Materials handling; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Carbon emissions; Construction and demolition waste; Embodied emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Life-cycle assessment; Site-suitability analyse; Suitability analysis; Life cycle","Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; King Faisal University, KFU, (GRANT5606); King Faisal University, KFU","The authors acknowledge the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia (Project No. GRANT5606).

To quantify the potential for reducing energy and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until 2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings of up to 23% and a corresponding 31% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand are offset by up to 65% by accounting for material use due to construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point indicators used. © 2019 The Authors","Building-stock modelling; Explorative LCA; GIS; Renovation; Scenario modelling","Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Building stocks; Business-as-usual; Explorative LCA; Gis based models; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renovation; Scenario modelling; Technical potential; environmental impact assessment; future prospect; GIS; life cycle analysis; modeling; residential development; urban housing; Environmental impact","European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT; National Cancer Center, NCC; Energimyndigheten","The authors would like to thank EIT Climate-KIC, AoA Energy, SIRen, NCC AB and The Swedish Energy Agency for funding the project.","M.
